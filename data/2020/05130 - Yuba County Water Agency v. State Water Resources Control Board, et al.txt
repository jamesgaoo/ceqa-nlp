PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Yuba County Water Agency ("YCWA") petitions this Court for a writ of mandate, and

2 other appropriate relief, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 directing respondent State

3 Water Resources Control Board (the "SWRCB"), its members named in their representative

4 capacities and its Executive Director Eileen Sobeck ("Sobeck"), named in her representative

5 capacity, to vacate the July 17, 2020 Water Quality Certification for the Yuba River Development

6 Project ("Yuba Project") issued by Ms. Sobeck as the SWRCB's purported delegate.

7 INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

8 Petitioner

9 1. Petitioner, YCWA, is a public agency specifically created by the State of

10 California to address the "water problems in the County of Yuba" through "countywide water
DI 'NVHVNVHS Y MOINOHY OIMaMIVa 11 conservation, flood control and development of water resources" and that enactment of that
WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM 12 "special law is necessary for the conservation, development, control and use of said water for the

13 public good and for the protection of life and property therein." Cal. Stats. 1959, p. 2798, At all

14 times relevant herein, YCWA has had long-standing involvement in environmental and

15 economic sustainability issues.

16 2. In the late 1960s, to reduce risk of flooding and to provide water supply for Yuba

17 County, YCWA financed and built the Yuba Project, located on the Yuba River.

18 3. The Yuba Project consists of: (a) New Bullards Bar Dam and Reservoir; (b) Our

19 House Diversion Dam; (c) Log Cabin Diversion Dam; (d) Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel; 5)

20 Camptonville Diversion Tunnel; (e) New Colgate Powerhouse; (f) Narrows 2 Powerhouse; and

21 (g) several recreational facilities.

22 4. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (*FERC") is the agency that

23 regulates operations of hydroelectric projects under the Federal Power Act ("FPA"), 16 U.S.C.

24 §§ 791, et seq. YCWA is the FPA licensee, owner and operator of the Yuba Project. YCWA's

25 initial license for the Yuba Project was issued on May 16, 1963 and amended on May 6, 1966.

26 That license ended in 2016, and the Yuba Project is now required to renew its FPA license.

27 YCWA currently operates the Yuba Project under annual licenses automatically issued by FERC

28 from year to year, under section 15 of the FPA.

(00204199.4) -1-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 5.

2 Additionally, YCWA holds several appropriative water-right permits and

3 licenses, issued by the State Water Rights Board, for the Yuba Project.
6.

4 Yuba's initial FPA license was issued prior to the enactment of the federal Clean

5 Water Act ("CWA"), (33 U.S.C §§ 1251 et seq.), but the CWA's relevant requirements will apply

6 to the new license. Under CWA section 401, a FERC licensee in California like YCWA, in order

7 to obtain a new FERC license, must obtain a water quality certification from the SWRCB that

8 the Yuba Project's discharges will comply with applicable water quality standards, unless the

9 SWRCB waives its authority to issue such a certification.
7.

10

BARTKIEWICI KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC This Petition arises from the July 17, 2020 purported issuance of a CWA section

11 401 water quality certification (*Purported 401 Certification") for FERC's relicensing of the

WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM 12 Yuba Project by the SWRCB's Executive Officer, Ms. Sobeck, under authority purportedly

13 delegated to her by the SWRCB. This petition concerns, among other things: (a) the validity of

14 the SWRCB's purported delegation of authority to Ms. Sobeck to issue the Purported 401

15 Certification; (b) the process by which Ms. Sobeck issued the Purported 401 Certification; and

16 (c) the terms within the Purported 401 Certification.
Respondents

17 8.

18 Respondent SWRCB is, and at all relevant times has been, a board of the State of

19 California, created by the Legislature through its adoption of section 175 of the Water Code. The

20 SWRCB is responsible for the adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the state in the field of

21 water resources. Water Code, § 174. The SWRCB is the state agency responsible for CWA

22 section 401 water quality certifications in California. Water Code § 13160.

9.

23 The SWRCB promulgated regulations regarding the application for, review of,

24 and issuance or denial of water quality certifications. Those regulations are found in Cal. Code

25 Regs. ("CCR"), title 23, Section 3830 et seq.
10.

26 The SWRCB's regulations purport to delegate to the SWRCB's Executive

27 Director all authority that the five members of the SWRCB collectively hold as a board to issue
water quality certifications.

2 The Yuba Project FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

3 18.

4 The Yuba Project is located in northern California in the western Sierra Nevada
mountains and their foothills.

5 19.

6 Yuba Project facilities are located on the main stem of the Yuba River, Middle
Yuba River and North Yuba River;

7 20. and Oregon Creek, a tributary to the Middle Yuba River.

8 The North Yuba, Middle Yuba and South Yuba Rivers flow together to form the

9 Yuba River. The Yuba River is a tributary to the Feather River and is part of the Sacramento
River Basin.

10 21.

& 11

WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, I In the 1800s, hydraulic mining occurred in the Yuba River watershed to a massive a

12 extent, with large volumes of water being used to blast away hillsides to extract gold deposits,

13 causing the accumulation of sediments in the river that continues today. Hydraulic mining debris,

14 including the use of mercury to extract gold, has eliminated much of the riparian vegetation along

15 the lower Yuba River and has had a serious adverse effect on the quality of Chinook salmon and

16 steelhead habitat. YCWA was not involved in this historic hydraulic mining.
22.

17 The Englebright Dam, located in the watershed's Narrows downstream of where

18 the North, Middle and South Yuba Rivers form the Yuba River, and Daguerre Point Dam, located

19 on the mainstem Yuba River downstream of Englebright Dam, were constructed by the California

20 Debris Commission in 1941 and 1906, respectively, to trap sediment derived from mining

21 operations in the watershed and prevent that debris from flowing downstream. Those two dams,

22 both of which are now owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE"),

23 predated, by over 25 years, the creation of YCWA and YCWA's construction of the Yuba
Project.

24 23.

25 Since its completion in 1941, the Englebright Dam has completely blocked the

26 passage of Chinook salmon and steelhead to the

24. upper Yuba River watershed.

27 At Daguerre Point Dam, two fish ladders, one located at each end of the dam,

28 were reconstructed by USACE and the State of California in 1965 after severe damage was
incurred during high flood flows. The reconstructed ladders, which continue to exist today,

2 may delay or prevent upstream passage of Chinook salmon and steelhead upstream passage due
to antiquated design, as well as maintenance issues.

3 The FERC Relicensing of the Yuba Project

4 25.

5 On April 28, 2014, YCWA filed with FERC an application for a new a license to
operate the Yuba Project.

6 26.

7 After filing its application with FERC, YCWA reached agreement with federal

8 and state resource agencies on more than 30 protection, mitigation, and enhancement (*PM&E")
measures to be incorporated into the new license.
1. 27.

10 On June 5, 2017, YCWA filed an amended license application with FERC,

Dd 'NVEVNVHS & MOINONY BARTKIEWICI 11 including YCWA's proposed license conditions that reflect the settled PM&E measures.

28.

12 FERC issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") pursuant to the

WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM 13 National Environmental Policy Act on May 30, 2018, and FERC and USACE issued the Final
EIS on January 2, 2019. The Final EIS concluded that a number of factors other than the Yuba

14

15 Project have contributed significantly to the degradation of anadromous fish habitat and

16 constraints on riparian vegetation development in the Yuba River basin, including mining in the

17 floodplain and river channel and blocked or impaired access to historical spawning and rearing
habitat at other hydroelectric projects and water diversions in the basin.

18

19 The SWRCB's Actions on YCWA's Application for Water Quality Certification
29.

20 On August 24, 2017, pursuant to CWA section 401, YCWA filed with the

21 SWRCB its initial application for a water quality certification for the Yuba Project's FERC
relicensing.

22 30.

23 The SWRCB issued a public notice of YCWA's 2017 application for a water

24 quality certification on September 21, 2017. The SWRCB has never issued another public notice

25 for any water quality certification for the FERC relicensing of the Yuba Project.
31.

26 The one-year deadline for the SWRCB to complete its work on YCWA's August

27 24, 2017 application for the water quality certification was August 24, 2018. In a July 25, 2018

28 email, the SWRCB's staff informed YCWA that the SWRCB could not complete its work on the
water quality certification for the FERC relicensing of the Yuba Project at that time and directed

(03204199.4} -5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 YCWA to withdraw and resubmit its application as soon as possible. The SWRCB staff intended
2 to restart the one-year deadline to prepare a water quality certification for the Yuba Project by
3 having YCWA file a "new" application.

4 32. On August 3, 2018, at the SWRCB's request, YCWA withdrew and resubmitted
its application for a water quality certification for the FERC relicensing of the Yuba Project.

6 33. In a July 31, 2019 letter, Ms. Sobeck, as the SWRCB's Executive Director, denied

7 without prejudice YCWA's application for a water quality certification for the FERC relicensing
8 of the Yuba Project. A copy of that July 31, 2019 letter is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

9 34. After July 31, 2019, YCWA has not filed any new or renewed application for a
10 water quality certification for the FERC relicensing of the Yuba Project.
Od 'NVHVNVHS  MOINOHY ZOLMCENLAVE 11 Request for and Issuance of Waiver

12 35. On August 22, 2019, YCWA filed a request with FERC for a determination that WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.CO 13 the SWRCB waived its water quality certification authority under CWA section 401 for the
14 relicensing of the Yuba Project.

15 36. On May 21, 2020, FERC issued an Order finding that the SWRCB had waived its
16 water quality certification authority under section 401 of the CWA for the relicensing of the Yuba
17 Project.

18 37. On September 17, 2020, the SWRCB filed a Petition for Review of FERC's

19 waiver determination. FERC's waiver decision is currently under review by the Ninth Circuit.
20 Cal. State Water Res. Control Bd. v. FERC, Case No. 20-72782 (9th Cir. filed Sept. 17, 2020);
21 S. Yuba River Citizens League v. FERC, Case No. 20-72800 (9th Cir. filed Sept. 18, 2020)
22 (consolidated).

23 The SWRCB's Actions after Waiver Determination and Without a Pending Application
24 38. After FERC issued the waiver determination on May 21, 2020, SWRCB staff
25 engaged in communications with entities other than YCWA regarding the formulation of a water
26 quality certification for the FERC relicensing of the Yuba Project. The communications
27 continued through July 2020. The SWRCB provided YCWA no similar opportunity to
28 participate in the formulation of a water quality certification for the Yuba Project's FERC

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

relicensing, gave YCWA no notice that the SWRCB was consulting with others and provided

2 YCWA no opportunity to rebut whatever information those other entities provided to the

3 SWRCB concerning the potential terms of a water quality certification.

4 39. One of the other entities with which the SWRCB's staff was in communication

5 with while they were developing a water quality certification for the Yuba Project's FERC

6 relicensing was Foothill Water Network ("FWN"), which is a collection of environmental

7 groups. The collection of environmental groups that comprises FWN includes the Mother Lode

8 Chapter of the Sierra Club, a non-profit organization. Andrew Sawyer, the SWRCB's chief

9 water-right attorney, is, and was at all times relevant herein, also an officer, director or other

10 representative of the Mother Lode Chapter of the Sierra Club elected by that chapter's members.
ZOIMGXIUVA KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 Mr. Sawyer has voluntarily and successfully sought elected leadership positions with the Mother
NOO"NHLIMVISHE AMMM 12 Lode Chapter of the Sierra Club for many years. Based upon information and belief, Mr. Sawyer

13 participated in the SWRCB's preparation of the Purported 401 Certification, at least by

14 supervising SWRCB staff counsel Marianna Aue's work on the same, while maintaining his

15 position and contacts with the Mother Lode Chapter of the Sierra Club.

16 40. a In a June 22, 2020 filing with FERC, the SWRCB staff attached a draft. of its

17 purported water quality certification for the Yuba Project. YCWA had never seen or been

18 allowed to comment on this draft and first received notice of it when the SWRCB staff filed it

19 with FERC.

20 41. On July 13, 2020, YCWA sent the SWRCB a letter reminding it that YCWA had

21 no pending application for a 401 water quality certification for the Yuba Project's relicensing by

22 FERC. YCWA further notified the SWRCB that, to the extent the SWRCB believed YCWA had

23 a pending application, that YCWA withdrew the same. YCWA also inquired as to why the

24 SWRCB had, in its June 22, 2020 filing with FERC, represented that it was providing a draft

25 water quality certification. No response was provided by the SWRCB.

26 42. On July 17, 2020, as the SWRCB's purported delegate, Ms. Sobeck issued the

27 Purported 401 Certification for FERC's Yuba Project relicensing. The Purported 401

28 Certification is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

(00204169.4) -7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43.

2 The SWRCB did not publish any public notice that the Purported 401

3 Certification's issuance was pending or provide any public-comment or public-review period

4 before Ms. Sobeck issued the Purported 401 Certification.
44. Unlike other entities like FWN, YCWA was never contacted by the SWRCB in
2020 regarding the formulation of the

6 45. Purported 401 Certification.

7 YCWA received no reasonable, or even written, notice that the SWRCB was

8 drafting a water quality certification for the Yuba Project in 2020.
46.

9 YCWA received no reasonable or written notice that the SWRCB would be

10 issuing the Purported 401 Certification despite YCWA's July 13, 2020 correspondence

OLAEEYIVA KRONICK & SHANAIAN, PC 11 reiterating that no application was pending. YCWA was only notified orally on July 16, 2020,

WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM 12 the day before the Purported 401 Certification was issued, that Ms. Sobeck would be issuing that
document.

13

14 Matters that Invalidate the July 17, 2020 Purported 401 Certification

47.

15 The SWRCB, and Ms. Sobeck as the SWRCB's purported delegate, had no legal

16 authority to issue the Purported 401 Certification because YCWA had no application for a CWA

17 section 401 water quality certification for FERC's relicensing of the Yuba Project pending before
the SWRCB.

18 48.

19 There was no legal authority for the SWRCB to delegate the issuance of the

20 Purported 401 Certification, to the Executive Director, Ms. Sobeck, or other staff at the SWRCB.

21 No quorum of the SWRCB ever voted in an open and public meeting to adopt the Purported 401
Certification.

22 49.

23 The process by which the Purported 401 Certification was issued, without public

24 proceedings, without the opportunity to comment, and without quorum of the SWRCB voting
in an

25 open meeting, violated applicable fair hearing requirements, the state's Administrative
Adjudication Bill of Rights, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act and constitutional due process
26 requirements.

27 50.

28 Before issuing the Purported 401 Certification, the SWRCB failed to analyze the
potential that the Purported 401 Certification's implementation would damage Yuba River's

400204199.4) -8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 salmon and steelhead by increasing water temperatures and reducing aquatic habitat at key times.

2 Among other things, the available evidence demonstrates that, if the SWRCB were to implement

3 the conditions in the Purported 401 Certification, it could cause water temperatures to exceed

4 important temperature thresholds for salmon more often than if the conditions were not

5 implemented.

6 51. Before issuing the Purported 401 Certification, the SWRCB failed to analyze the

7 impacts on Yuba County's disadvantaged communities and groundwater basins. There is no

8 indication that the SWRCB or Ms. Sobeck considered water-supply impacts at all in developing

9 the terms of the Purported 401 Certification.

10 52. The Purported 401 Certification failed to consider well-documented conditions
DI 'NVHVNVHS  NOINOHY 'ZOIMIILLUVI 11 affecting the Yuba River prior to the construction of the Yuba Project, including, but not limited
NOD'NHHMVISXE MAM 12 to, the lasting effects on the Yuba River's habitat for fish resulting from historic hydraulic

13 mining. For context, many decades before YCWA built the Yuba Project, hydraulic mining
was moved to build the 14 resulted in more earth being washed into the Yuba River watershed than

15 Panama Canal.

16 53. The Purported 401 Certification purports to authorize the SWRCB's employees,

17 without any guaranteed hearing, to attempt to make YCWA responsible for mitigating

18 environmental conditions that were not caused by the Yuba Project, but instead result from the

19 construction of Englebright Dam and Daguerre Point Dam and historic hydraulic mining in the

20 Yuba River watershed, among other things.

21 54. In excess of the SWRCB's authority under section 401 of the CWA, the Purported

22 401 Certification authorizes the SWRCB's employees to require YCWA to take numerous

23 actions to address conditions that are unrelated to water quality, including recreational activities

24 and sediment management that are unrelated to Yuba Project discharges, and unrelated to

25 whether those discharges comply with existing state water quality requirements.

26 55. The Purported 401 Certification, issued by Ms. Sobeck as the SWRCB's delegate,

27 would impose conditions and obligations on YCWA's operation of the Yuba Project. YCWA's

28 technical analysis indicates that the Purported 401 Certification's conditions could impose on

-9. (00204909.4)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

YCWA and the communities it serves - including disadvantaged communities as defined by
2 California law - economic impacts in the range of approximately $500 million to potentially over

3 $1 billion over the next 50 years, which is the expected term of the new FERC license.

4 56. Based upon information and belief, if the Purported 401 Certification is not set

5 aside, it will result in harm to salmon, to YCWA and the disadvantaged communities YCWA

6 serves, and to cities, farms and businesses that rely on groundwater extraction for their water

7 supplies.

8 YCWA's Petition for Reconsideration

9 57. On August 13, 2020, YCWA requested that the SWRCB prepare the

10 administrative record for the Purported 401 Certification issued by Ms. Sobeck. Attached hereto
BARTKIFWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 as Exhibit C is a copy of the August 13, 2020 request. That request also included a Public
NOD 'NEIMVISHE'MMM 12 Records Act request for the administrative record. Among other things, YCWA requested all
13 documents concerning the Yuba Project dated from January 1, 2015 through July 17, 2020. The
14 SWRCB has produced some documents in response to this request, but, as of the date of the filing
15 of this petition, the administrative record has not yet been provided to YCWA.
16 58. On August 14, 2020, YCWA filed its petition for reconsideration of the Purported
17 401 Certification with the SWRCB. Attached hereto, as Exhibit D, is a copy a of that petition for
18 reconsideration ("Petition for Reconsideration") sans attachments.

19 59. YCWA's Petition for Reconsideration attached a 94-page Statement of Reasons,
20 Index, numerous technical appendices and a thumb drive containing thousands of pages of
21 historical and technical information in electronic format in support of the Petition for
22 Reconsideration.

23 60. Water Code section 13330 may be interpreted as having required the SWRCB to
24 decide whether to grant or deny YCWA's Petition for Reconsideration by October 15, 2020. By
25 October 15, 2020, the SWRCB had not issued notice or otherwise acted upon YCWA's Petition
26 for Reconsideration. This action followed. YCWA has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at
27 law other than the instant Petition.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 LEGAL BACKGROUND

2 Federal Power Act

3 61. The FPA represents a congressional intention to establish "a broad federal role in

4 the development and licensing of hydroelectric power." California v. FERC, 495 U.S. 490, 496

5 (1990).

6 62. The FPA establishes "a complete scheme of national regulation" to "promote the

7 comprehensive development of the water resources of the Nation," First lowa Hydro-Electric

8 Coop. v. FPC, 328 U.S. 152, 180 (1946), and grants FERC "comprehensive planning authority"

9 over the Nation's hydropower, including the licensing of hydroelectric generating facilities,

10 California v. FERC, 495 U.S. at 506.
BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 63. The FPA gives FERC the authority to issue licenses for dams (such as the Yuba

NOO NHIIMVISHE MMM 12 Project), to generate electric power at a dam or other a project works on navigable waters, federal

13 lands or reserves, and non-navigable streams which affect interstate or foreign commerce. 16

14 U.S.C. § 797(e).

15 64. Licenses may be issued for a maximum of 50 years. 16 U.S.C. § 799. Section 6

16 of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. § 799, provides that a license, once issued, "may be revoked only for the

17 reasons and in the manner prescribed under the provisions of this chapter, and may be altered or

18 surrendered only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the Commission [FERC]."

19 65. Once an initial FERC license is set to expire, the project operator must apply for

20 a new license through the relicensing process. Id. § 808(a). During relicensing, FERC evaluates

21 the project and determines whether continued project operation is in the public interest and, if so,

22 under what conditions. Id.

23 66. Section 10(a) of the FPA authorizes FERC to issue licenses subject to the

24 conditions that FERC deems best suited for power development and other public uses of the

25 waters. 16 U.S.C. § 803(a).

26 67. States lack any "veto power" or inherent sovereign power over federally licensed

27 hydroelectric projects.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Clean Water Act

2 68. Hydroelectric facilities licensed under the FPA are subject to CWA section 401

3 and its terms concerning water quality certifications ("401 Certifications").

4 69. Section 401 of the CWA requires all applicants for a federal license or permit to
5 obtain a 401 Certification from the applicable state agency, prior to issuance of any federal

6 license or permit that may result in a discharge to navigable waters and unless that state agency

7 has waived its certification authority. The water quality certification required pursuant to section

8 401 of the CWA is ancillary to other federal statute licensing requirements.

9 70. A state certifying agency's authority to issue or deny a 401 Certification for a

10 federal license or permit commences upon receipt of that federal license or permit applicant's
BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 request for certification. 40 C.F.R.$ 121.7. "Th[e] language [of CWA Section 401(a)(1)] clearly
NOO"MALIMV'ISHEMMM 12 expresses a congressional intent to place the burden of requesting a state water quality
13 certification on the license applicant." State of North Carolina v. FERC, 112 F.3d 1175, 1184
14 (D.C. Cir. 1997).

15 71. If the state fails or refuses to a act on a request for a 401 Certification within one

16 year after receipt of such request, the certification requirements are waived with respect to such
17 Federal license or permit. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1).

18 72. CWA section 401(a)(1) requires states to "establish procedures for public notice

19 in the case of all applications for certification." 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1). "[B]y implication,
20 section 401(a)(1) also requires states to comply with their public notice procedures." City of
21 Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 68 (D.C. Cir. 2006).
22 73. A 401 Certification is only required for an applicant for a Federal license or permit
23 to conduct an activity that may result in a discharge to navigable waters. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a).
24 74. Section 401 of the CWA provides that a state may grant a 401 Certification with
25 limitations or requirements, which will become conditions on the federal license. 33 U.S.C. §

26 1341(d). Section 401 limits states' power to impose conditions by providing that states may only
27 impose those conditions "necessary" to assure that the applicant "will comply with any [1]
28 applicable effluent limitations and other limitations, under [CWA Section 301 or 302], [2]

100201199.4] -12-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

T standard or performance under [CWA Section 306], or [3] prohibition, effluent standard, or

2 pretreatment standard under [CWA Section 307], and with any [4] other appropriate requirement

3 of State law." 33 U.S.C. § 1341(d).

4 75. If a state issues a valid 401 Certification for a hydroelectric facility subject to

5 certain conditions, FERC must include those conditions in its license.

6 76. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the federal agency

7 charged with administering the CWA.

8 77. On July 13, 2020, the EPA published a final rule, interpreting section 401 of the

9 CWA ("Final Rule"). Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification Rule, 85 Fed. Reg. 42,210 (July

10 13, 2020).
BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 78. Under the Final Rule, the scope of a 401 Certification "is limited to assuring that

NOO'NULIMVISXI'MMM 12 a discharge from a Federally licensed or permitted activity will comply with water quality

13 requirements." 40 C.F.R. § 121.3 (emphasis added),

14 79. "Discharge" is defined as "a discharge from a point source into a water of the

15 United States." 40 C.F.R. § 121.1(f). Conditions imposed under CWA section 401 that regulate

16 "the activity as a whole," rather than the discharge itself, are beyond the scope of section 401.

17 85 Fed. Reg. at 42,251.

18 80. "Water quality requirements" are defined as "applicable provisions of §§ 301,

19 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the Clean Water Act, and state or tribal regulatory requirements for
20 point source discharges into waters of the United States." 40 C.F.R. § 121.1(n).

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 81. This Court has jurisdiction over this petition pursuant to Water Code section

23 13330, Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

24 82. Venue is proper in Fresno County under Code of Civil Procedure section 393,

25 subdivision (b), as the effects will be felt in Fresno County and by the County's citizens and

26 water districts. In Corrected Order WR 2008-0014, the SWRCB approved the inclusion of

27 significant portions of Fresno County in the place of use under YCWA's water rights and

28 authorized water transfers to the portions of Fresno County within the authorized place of use.

400304199.4} -13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

As documented in the materials supporting YCWA's Petition for Reconsideration, as a result of

2 the SWRCB's Corrected Order WR 2008-0014, water from the Yuba Project is used within

3 Fresno County. In addition, under prior SWRCB orders issued before 2008, YCWA frequently

4 transferred water to water users in Fresno County over many years beginning no later than during

5 California's 1987-1992 drought. The technical analyses that YCWA submitted in support of its

6 Petition for Reconsideration indicate that the terms that the Purported 401 Certification

7 authorizes SWRCB staff to impose on YCWA - without any guaranteed hearing - would

8 significantly reduce, impair, or eliminate YCWA's ability to provide or transfer water for use in

9 Fresno County.

BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHIANAHAN, PC 10 83. Venue also is proper in Fresno County under Code of Civil Procedure section 401,
11 since respondent SWRCB is located in Sacramento County and the Attorney General has an
NOO WHLIMVISHI'MMM 12 office in Fresno County. Venue for this matter challenging the decision issued by a state agency
13 is therefore proper in Fresno County under Code of Civil Procedure section 401, subdivision (a).
14 In addition, Sacramento County would be a proper venue for this matter under Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 393 because the Purported 401 Certification purports to address conditions in
16 the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, both
17 of which are located, in part, in Sacramento County. Because venue would be proper in

18 Sacramento County, Code of Civil Procedure section 401, subdivision (a), makes venue proper
19 in Fresno County.
20 STANDING

21 84. YCWA has standing to assert the claims raised in this petition. As described
22 above, YCWA is beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding. The SWRCB
23 issued the Purported 401 Certification for YCWA's Yuba Project on July 17, 2020 when no
24 application was pending and without giving YCWA any hearing or even opportunity to comment
25 or providing written notice. The Purported 401 Certification contains terms and conditions that

26 could radically alter YCWA's operation of the Yuba Project, could compel YCWA to spend
27 hundreds of millions of dollars to implement fish passage above the USACE's Englebright Dam
28 and would increase YCWA's costs and result in lost revenue, resulting in economic impacts that

(00204199.4) -14-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

probably would exceed $500 million over the next 50 years. Further, Water Code section 13330,

2 subdivision (a), provides that any party aggrieved by a decision or order of the SWRCB may

3 obtain judicial review of the same.

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 85. As described above, the SWRCB did not give YCWA an opportunity to

6 participate in any hearing or other administrative proceeding, formal or informal, on the

7 Purported 401 Certification. YCWA was not given any opportunity to review or comment on a
draft of the Purported 401 Certification. Nonetheless, within 30 days of having received the

9 Purported 401 Certification, YCWA filed the Petition for Reconsideration in compliance with

10 the SWRCB's applicable regulation, namely California Code of Regulations title 23, Section

11 3867. In the Petition for Reconsideration, which was YCWA's first opportunity to do so, YCWA
NOOTUTIMVISHI'MMM BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 12 requested a formal hearing and objected to any informal hearings on the Purported 401

13 Certification for FERC's relicensing of the Yuba Project. Although Water Code section 13330
14 requires the SWRCB to act on a petition for reconsideration within 90 days of the issuance of the

15 Purported 401 Certification, the SWRCB failed to grant or deny YCWA's Petition for
16 Reconsideration in that 90-day period. YCWA therefore has exhausted the only administrative

17 remedy that was available to it.

18 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

19 86. YCWA is filing this petition within the time period indicated by the most-

20 stringent potential interpretation of Water Code section 13330, based on Ms. Sobeck's July 17,

21 2020 issuance of the Purported 401 Certification and the SWRCB's failure to act on YCWA's

22 Petition for Reconsideration.

23 CONCURRENT FEDERAL COURT ACTION

24 87. YCWA is concurrently filing a related case in the United States District Court for

25 the District of Columbia to challenge the Purported 401 Certification and the many related

26 violations of the federal Clean Water Act, Federal Power Act, constitutionally protected rights

27 and other legal requirements by the SWRCB and Ms. Sobeck in their issuance of the Purported

28 401 Certification. In its related case in the District Court, YCWA also is asserting the state-law

(00201199.4) -15-

2 causes of action stated in this petition under the District Court's supplemental jurisdiction

3 authorized by 28 U.S.C. section 1367.

88.

4 YCWA files this action in state court concurrently with the federal action to
preserve all of its claims.

6 89. NOTICE (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE $21167.5)

7 On November 12, 2020 YCWA provided notice of this petition to the SWRCB.

8 YCWA has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of

9 the notice with proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit E.

10 90. ATTORNEY FEES

11 In pursuing this action, which involves the enforcement of important rights

WWW.BKSLAWFIRM.COM ZOIMULALHVA KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 12 affecting the public interest, YCWA will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including the

13 citizens of Yuba County, and therefore will be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees

14 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and Government Code section 800.

15 91. STANDARD OF REVIEW

16 Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (b), the Court must

17 decide whether, in relation to the issuance of the Purported 401 Certification: the SWRCB

18 proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction; the SWRCB failed to provide a fair trial a or

19 hearing; the SWRCB committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by proceeding in violation of

20 law; the SWRCB committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by adopting an order not supported

21 by adequate findings; and whether the SWRCB committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion

22 because its findings - to the extent there are any - were not supported by substantial evidence.

23 Each of these failings is sufficiently independent to require that the Court issue a writ of mandate

24 commanding the SWRCB to vacate the Purported 401 Certification.

92.

25 CEQA violations are subject to a review for prejudicial abuse of discretion and

26 review of whether the SWRCB's findings were supported by substantial evidence in light of the

27 whole record. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.

93.

28 In relation to the issuance of the Purported 401 Certification, the SWRCB: (a)
proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction; (b) failed to provide a fair hearing; (c)

(00204399.4) -16-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by proceeding in violation of law; (d) committed a

2 prejudicial abuse of discretion by adopting an order not supported by adequate findings; and (e)

3 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion because its findings - to the extent there are any

4 were not supported by substantial evidence. Each of these failings is sufficiently independent to

5 require that the Court issue a writ of mandate commanding the SWRCB to vacate the Purported

6 401 Certification.

15 96. The CWA provides that the State must act on a FERC licensee's application for a

16 401 certification for the licensee's FERC relicensing of its project within one year of the

17 application. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1).

18 97. The scope of the SWRCB's authority to issue a 401 Certification is limited to

19 responding to a filed, and pending, application for certification. Cal. Code Regs., Title 23, §§

20 3835-3838; 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1).

21 98. An application for a 401 Certification is defined by California Code of

22 Regulations, title 23, section 3831(b) as "a written request for certification, including

23 accompanying materials."

24 99. The SWRCB is required to provide "public notice of an application at least

25 twenty-one days before taking certification action on the application ... ." Cal. Code Regs., title

26 23, § 3858, subd. (a) (emphasis added).

9 103. (Improper Delegation of Authority)

10 paragraphs.
BARTKIEWICH KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC YCWA repeats and incorporates by reference every allegation in the preceding

11 104.

WWW.BESLAWFIRM.COM 12 Water Code. The SWRCB was created by the California Legislature and is governed by the

13 105.

14 Water Code section 175 specifies that the SWRCB consist of five members with

15 specific qualifications and experience, each of whom is appointed by the Governor. The five

16 appointed members of the SWRCB are clothed with a public trust to exercise their judgment and

17 discretion. The exercise of judgment and discretion cannot be delegated in the absence of
statutory authorization.

18 106.

19 Water Code section 181 states that "[t]hree members of the board shall constitute

20 a quorum for the purpose of transacting any business of the board."
107.

21 Pursuant to Water Code section 13160, the authority to issue 401 Certifications is

22 vested with the SWRCB, which is a board of members appointed by the Governor and confirmed

23 by the state Senate, and not the SWRCB's staff.

108.

24 The Water Code does not grant authority to the appointed members of the

25 SWRCB to delegate powers or public trust duties held by the SWRCB, collectively, to the

26 Executive Director or to any staff member or individual.

109.

27 The Water Code does not authorize the SWRCB to promulgate regulations that

28 allow actions that are not permitted by statute or that conflict with constitutional principles of
due process, nor does the Water Code authorize the SWRCB to promulgate regulations that allow

(00204199.4) -18-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the SWRCB members to delegate their public trust responsibilities to make decisions entrusted

2 to them by the Governor.

110. The California Constitution requires that all of the statutes authorizing any

4 delegations to staff be interpreted narrowly to avoid decisions being made outside of the public's

5 view. Cal. Const., art. I, § 3 (b).

6 111. Notwithstanding the above limitations of authority, the SWRCB's regulations,

7 and specifically California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 3838(a), state that the SWRCB's

8 Executive Director, or his/her designee, may "take all actions connected with applications for

9 [water quality] certification, including issuance and denial of certification."

10 112. The SWRCB's applicable regulations purport to provide complete delegation of

11 the SWRCB's discretion, judgment, and authority to issue 401 Certifications to the Executive
NOO WHLIMVISHE MMM BARTKIEWICZ, KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 12 Director.

13 113. The SWRCB's applicable regulations purport to authorize the Executive Director

14 to issue or deny a 401 Certification without a hearing and without a vote of a quorum of the

15 SWRCB.

16 114. The Purported 401 Certification was issued without prior notice to YCWA,

17 without any public proceeding or participation, and without any opportunity for YCWA to

18 address any of the information on which the Purported 401 Certification was based.

19 115. The Purported 401 Certification was issued by Ms. Sobeck based upon the

20 sections of the SWRCB's regulations delegating authority to the Executive Director, but the

21 Purported 401 Certification is invalid because those regulations violate law and Ms. Sobeck did

22 not have valid legal authority to take this action.

23 116. The Purported 401 Certification includes terms and conditions under which

24 SWRCB staff purports to grant themselves ongoing authority to modify those terms and

25 conditions, including but not limited to terms and conditions relating to the Bay-Delta Water

26 Quality Control Plan ("Bay-Delta Plan") that have not yet been adopted.

11 failed to consider the potential impacts of the imposition of the conditions of the Purported 401

WWW.BESLAWFIRM.COM 12 Certification including, but not limited to, the following:

a.

13 The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze how the imposition of

14 its Condition 1(D) could result in severe impacts to water temperatures to support Yuba River

15 salmonids, hydroelectric generation, and agricultural water supplies.

b.

16 The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze how the imposition of

17 its Condition 20 is not viable, is not likely to result in fishery benefits, or substantial benefits,

18 and would likely result in significant costs to YCWA ranging between $624 million and $1.03

19 billion. For example, Englebright Dam, owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has created

20 an impassible barrier to salmon and other fish since 1941 and stores potentially toxic sediment.

21 The Purported 401 Certification does not contain or cite any analysis showing the ability of fish

22 to survive, or thrive, in the habitat above the dam. The height of a fish ladder past Englebright

C.

24 The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze the well-documented

25 impacts of historic hydraulic mining on the lower Yuba River's habitat, and the impacts resulting

26 from the construction of Daguerre Point and Englebright Dams to impound hydraulic debris and
associated toxic materials.

27 d.

28 The Purported 401 Certification further ignored evidence that the
imposition of its Condition 12 and its associated actions would (a) not be economically feasible;

(00201199.4) -22-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (b) would not be physically feasible; and (c) would not likely support habitat for the fish in

2 question.

3 e. The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze how the imposition of

4 its Condition 6 would affect YCWA's ability to derive hydroelectric generation at YCWA's New

5 Colgate powerhouse and failed to consider the evidence that the imposition of this condition

6 would provide little environmental benefit but result in a significant financial burden. For

7 example, in their Final EIS, FERC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found that the

8 additional tunnel closures would only prevent the entrainment of about 21 fish a year, that fish

9 that went into the tunnel would not be subject to any turbines and that there was evidence fish

10 diverted into the tunnel actually could swim back up it. The Purported 401 Certification did not
Dd 'NVHVNVHS  XOINOHY 'ZOIMADNIAVE 11 address this analysis in any way. Meanwhile, the tunnel closures would cost YCWA

WWW.BESLAWFIRM.COM 12 approximately $22 million not adjusted for inflation - in lost hydroelectric generation revenue

13 over a new FERC license's 50-year term.

14 f. The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze the impact of the

15 imposition of its Condition 7 on YCWA's ability to operate its New Colgate powerhouse,
16 particularly as to operations in compliance with a 1993 agreement with the California Department

17 of Fish and Wildlife. The Purported 401 Certification failed to consider evidence that imposition

18 of 7 Condition 7 would not make the lower Yuba River cooler, even though it would result in

19 significant costs to YCWA.

20 g. The Purported 401 Certification failed to analyze the millions of dollars in

21 lost revenue and increased costs to YCWA that will result over the term of the license. The

22 Purported 401 Certification further failed to consider the significant indirect impacts of this loss

23 and increased costs on the disadvantaged communities and local economy of Yuba County.

24 h. The Purported 401 Certification, failed to analyze how it may impact, or

25 otherwise cause overdraft of, Yuba County's groundwater basins.

26 i. The Purported 401 Certification, failed to consider its impact on YCWA's

27 ability to transfer water to communities that need additional sources of water, which advances

28 California's policy of providing water supplies to regions in need.

21 139. The recent statutory amendments to Water Code section 13160 did not authorize

22 the SWRCB to skirt its CEQA obligations and issue the Purported 401 Certification without
23 environmental review. That amendment only applies where the SWRCB decides that it may risk
24 a future waiver of authority if it waits to act. In this case, there was no risk of future waiver
25 because, based on past facts that cannot be changed, FERC had already issued the waiver
26 determination before Ms. Sobeck issued the Purported 401 Certification. By failing to undertake
27 CEQA review before Ms. Sobeck issued the Purported 401 Certification, the SWRCB failed to

7 141. As interpreted by the California Supreme Court, Article X, section 2 of the
California Constitution requires that state decisionmakers assess the water costs of their decisions

9 for competing uses of water and seek to minimize those costs.

14 of the Yuba River.

15 144. The Purported 401 Certification failed to explain how its terms comply with

16 Article X, section 2's and Porter-Cologne's fundamental policies. Many of its terms - particularly

17 those concerning Yuba River streamflows, fish passage and lower Yuba River habitat - are so

18 vague and subject to the exercise of future SWRCB staff discretion that it is not possible for the

19 certification to have bridged the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or
20 order. This is especially true in light of the fact that the Purported 401 Certification contains

21 terms that FERC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rejected in their Final EIS for FERC's

22 relicensing of the Yuba Project, without explaining why the SWRCB found the Final EIS's

23 analysis to be inadequate.

24 145. The Purported 401 Certification failed to consider relevant factors as required by

25 Article X, section 2 and Porter-Cologne; failed to explain why relevant data that was readily

26 available from FERC's proceedings was disregarded; and failed to explain a rational connection

27 between the facts found and the choice made, to the extent choices were made in light of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

168. The Purported 401 Certification violates section 401 of the CWA, in addition to

2 exceeding the scope of the SWRCB's authority under that statute, in at least nine ways.

3 169. First, Defendant Sobeck's issuance of the Purported 401 Certification on behalf

4 of the SWRCB exceeded the state's authority under CWA section 401 because YCWA had no

5 application for a 401 Certification pending at the time Defendant Sobeck issued the Purported

6 401 Certification. Defendant Sobeck denied YCWA's last 401 certification application without

7 prejudice in 2019 and YCWA has not submitted a new certification request.

8 170. Second, the SWRCB and its purported delegate Ms. Sobeck issued the Purported

9 401 Certification without formal or even written notice to YCWA, in violation of CWA section

10 401's implicit notice requirement. The SWRCB's September 21, 2017 notice of YCWA's prior
DJ 'NVHVNVHS Y MOINOHX 'ZOIMMMIHVE 11 application for a 401 Certification was no longer effective because: (a) in 2018, YCWA withdrew
WOO WHLIMV 12 that application at the SWRCB's request; and (b) in 2019, Ms. Sobeck denied without prejudice

13 the application for a 401 Certification that YCWA filed in 2018.

14 171. Third, the Purported 401 Certification exceeds the scope of CWA section 401 by

15 imposing conditions to address environmental conditions that are caused by actions or activities

16 of third parties and that are not attributable to YCWA's actions. These conditions include, but

17 are not limited to:

18 a. Conditions 1, 27, 31 and 32, under which the SWRCB could compel

19 YCWA to comply with provisions in the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan and/or future
20 updates thereto that mitigate for conditions caused by other water diverters.

21 b. Condition 20, under which the SWRCB's Executive Director could

22 compel YCWA to provide fish passage above the Englebright Dam; and
restoration plan 23 C. Condition 12, which would require YCWA to prepare a

24 to remedy habitat conditions that were caused by hydraulic mining and the Englebright and

25 Daguerre Point Dams.

26 172. Fourth, CWA section 401 only authorizes conditions to address a project's point

27 source discharges, not the entire "activity" involved in the relevant application for a federal

28 permit of license. 40 C.F.R. § 121.1(f), (n), 85 Fed. Reg. at 42,234. The Purported 401

3 (spill reduction), 6 (closures at Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel), 8 (large woody material), 9

13 Discharges), and 46 (compliance with statewide NPDES Permit on Residual Aquatic Pesticide

14 Discharges).

15 173. Fifth, the Purported 401 Certification's conditions exceed the scope of authority
16 under CWA section 401 because some conditions are unrelated to water quality and are not
17 necessary to ensure compliance with water quality standards, including but not limited to
18 Conditions 4(e) and 20. See 85 Fed. Reg. at 42,253; Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty. v.
19 Wash. Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700, 712 (1994) ("The State can only ensure that the project

25 174. Sixth, conditions in a 401 Certification must be "necessary" to assure compliance
26 with "appropriate requirement[s] of State law." 33 U.S.C. § 1341(d). Any conditions imposed
27 in the certification must be accompanied by an explanation of "why the condition is necessary to

1 40 C.F.R. § 121.7(d)(1)(i); and a citation to the relevant "federal, state, or tribal law that

2 authorizes the condition," id. § 121.7(d)(1)(ii). The SWCRB and Ms. Sobeck did not provide

3 such an explanation and did not provide such citations in the Purported 401 Certification.

4 175. Seventh, the issuance of and the conditions imposed in the Purported 401

5 Certification by Defendant Sobeck violate numerous California laws. Conditions that violate

6 state law cannot be necessary to assure that YCWA complies with "appropriate requirements of

7 State law," 33 U.S.C. § 1341(d), and thus fall outside the scope of conditions authorized under

8 section 401.

9 176. Eighth, once a state acts on a 401 Certification request, CWA section 401 does

10 not provide an ongoing role for the state to enforce certification conditions or unilaterally modify
LOIMaDIIaVa KRONICK & SHANAHAN, PC 11 the certification. § 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(5); 40 C.F.R. § 121.11(c); 85 Fed. Reg. at 42,275. States
NOO WHLIMVISXE MMM 12 have one year to act upon an application for certification, and may not extend that period by

13 exercising ongoing enforcement authority. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1); 85 Fed. Reg. at 42,279.

14 Instead, federal licensing or permitting agencies have sole responsibility for enforcement of

15 certification conditions. Further, the Purported 401 Certification improperly includes conditions

16 that would allow the SWRCB to unilaterally modify the Purported 401 Certification and/or
17 exercise ongoing enforcement authority over the certification conditions, which exceed the

18 SWRCB's authority under section 401(a)(1) and (a)(5). Such conditions include but are not

19 limited to: conditions 1(D), 6, 4(E), 4(F), 5(A)-(C), 6, 8-14, 16, 18-22, 25-30, 33, 35-38, 41, 44, 46.
20 177. Ninth, CWA section 401 only authorizes a state to certify whether a project will

21 comply with existing water quality standards. 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (referencing 33 U.S.C. cop

22 1313). Proposed state water quality standards are not water quality standards until they are
23 approved by EPA. 33 U.S.C. § 1313(c)(3). The Purported 401 Certification's conditions,

24 including but not limited to Conditions 1(D), 27, 28, and 31-32, exceed the scope of authority

25 under CWA section 401 because they attempt to require YCWA to comply with water quality

26 criteria from a proposed update to the Bay-Delta water quality control plan, which the SWRCB
27 has not yet adopted and EPA has not approved. Conditions 1(D), 27, 28, and 31-32 also

Yuba River Development Project Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Project No. 2246 Nevada, Sierra, and Yuba Counties
SUBJECT: DENIAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE OF WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION FOR YUBA RIVER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

Dear Mr. Aikens:

On August 3, 2018, the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) received a request from Yuba Water Agency (YWA) for water quality certification (certification), pursuant to section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 USC § 1341 et seq.) for the relicensing of the Yuba River Development Project (Project), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Project No. 2246. Waterbodies associated with the Project include the Middle Yuba River, North Yuba River, and Yuba
River.

In taking a certification action, the State Water Board must either: (1) issue an appropriately conditioned water quality certification; or (2) deny certification. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3859.) A certification may be issued if it is determined that there is if reasonable assurance that an activity is protective of state and federal water quality standards and that the appropriate environmental documents have been adopted to support certification and meet the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). However, when a proposed project's "compliance with water quality standards and other appropriate requirements is not yet necessarily determined, but the application suffers from some procedural inadequacy (e.g., failure to...meet CEQA requirements)," the State Water Board may deny certification without prejudice. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3837, subd. (b)(2).)

Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

1.0 Project Description
Yuba County Water Agency (YCWA, doing business as Yuba Water Agency, or Licensee) owns and operates the Yuba River Development Project (Project), which is located on the Yuba, North Yuba, and Middle Yuba rivers and on Oregon Creek. The Yuba River is a tributary to the Feather River and is part of the Sacramento River Basin, which drains to the San Francisco Bay through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. The nearest cities to the Project are Camptonville, located approximately three miles east of New Bullards Bar Reservoir, and Smartsville, located six miles southwest of the Narrows 2 Powerhouse. The Project was initially licensed to operate by the Federal Power Commission, predecessor to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), on May 16, 1963.
The Project includes the following facilities: 1) New Bullards Bar Dam and Reservoir; 2) Our House Diversion Dam; 3) Log Cabin Diversion Dam; 4) Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel; 5) Camptonville Diversion Tunnel; 6) New Colgate Powerhouse; 7) Narrows 2 Powerhouse (including bypass facilities); and 8) several roadways and recreational facilities (including a recreation water treatment facility for fire hydrants, toilets, and campsite spigots). The Project's energy generation capacity is 361 megawatts. Portions of the Project are on federal lands managed by the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS) as part of the Plumas and Tahoe national forests, and federal lands administered by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
Figure 1: Schematic of the Yuba River Development Project Operations illustrates how water flows though the Project. Water generally flows through the Project as follows:
The Project diverts water from the Middle Yuba River via Our House Diversion Dam through the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel (maximum capacity of 860 cubic feet per second (cfs)), which discharges into Oregon Creek above the Log Cabin Diversion Dam.

Discharge from the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel and additional flow from Oregon Creek are diverted by Log Cabin Diversion Dam into the Camptonville Diversion Tunnel (maximum capacity of 1,100 cfs), which discharges into New Bullards Bar Reservoir (usable storage capacity of 966,103 acre-feet (AF)).
Water is diverted from New Bullards Bar Dam into the New Bullards Bar
Powerhouse Intake, then the New Colgate Power Tunnel, and then New Colgate Powerhouse, which is located on the Yuba River above Englebright Reservoir. New Colgate Powerhouse operates as a peaking hydropower facility, meaning its flow releases vary based on energy demand and the powerhouse can quickly increase water releases for hydropower production.
New Colgate Powerhouse discharges to the Middle Yuba River above
Englebright Reservoir, which is owned and operated by the USACE.
Water is diverted from Englebright Reservoir into a power intake tunnel to the Narrows 2 Powerhouse.

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project July 2020
Final Water Quality Certification
Narrows 2 Powerhouse discharges to the lower Yuba River below Englebright Dam, which flows into the Feather River.
YCWA releases minimum flows from Log Cabin Diversion Dam, Our House Diversion Dam, New Bullards Bar Dam, and the Narrows 2 Powerhouse into Oregon Creek, the Middle Yuba River, the North Yuba River, and the Yuba River, respectively. The Project also releases water into the Yuba River below Englebright (lower Yuba River) in order to meet flow requirements specified in YCWA's consumptive water rights, as described in Revised State Water Board Water Right Decision 1644 and Corrected Water Right Order No. 2008-0014. Corrected Water Right Order No. 2008-0014 provides for
implementation of the Lower Yuba River Accord (Yuba Accord)1.
In addition to the extension of authorization to operate the Project for 50 years, YCWA proposes several general changes to existing Project facilities, including: 1) addition of a tailwater depression system at New Colgate Powerhouse; 2) addition of a new Auxiliary Flood Control Outlet at New Bullards Bar Reservoir; 3) modification of Our House Diversion Dam fish release outlet; 4) modification of Log Cabin Diversion Dam fish release outlet; 5) modification of Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel Intake; 6) modifications of recreation facilities at New Bullards Bar Reservoir; and 7) modifications of Project roads. Additional information on the Project facilities, current Project operations, and YCWA's proposed Project operations can be found in Exhibits A and B of YCWA's June 2, 2017 Amended Final License Application (Amended FLA) (YCWA 2017a), as updated by subsequent filings, including but not limited to, the: 1) July 21, 2017 submittal updating information on ramping rates, recreational flows, and recreational facility plans (YCWA 2017b); 2) September 15, 2017 submittal regarding amendments to operation of flood control facilities (YCWA 2017d); 3) November 1, 2017 submittal regarding amendments to hydropower generation estimates and projected costs of environmental measures (YCWA 2017e); 4) April 12, 2018 submittal requesting FERC replace the Amended FLA's existing large woody material (LWM) management plan at three facilities and filing an updated recreation facilities plan (YCWA 2018a); 5) April 27, 2018 submittals requesting FERC replace the Amended FLA's existing proposal for ramping and flow fluctuations below Narrow 2 Powerhouse, as well as updates to the water year types pertaining to Narrows 2 Powerhouse and Narrows 2 Full Bypass (YCWA 2018b); 6) July 27, 2018 submittal requesting FERC replace the Amended FLA's existing sediment management proposal for Our House and Log Cabin dams' sediment management (YCWA 2018c); and 7) September 19, 2018 submittal requesting FERC replace the previous recreation facilities plan with a revised plan (YCWA 2018d).

2.0 Regulatory Authority

2.1 Water Quality Certification and Related Authorities The federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387) was enacted "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." (33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).) The Clean Water Act relies significantly on state participation and support, in light of States' "primary responsibilities and rights" to "prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution." (Id., § 1251(b).) Federal agencies must "co-operate with the State and local agencies to develop comprehensive solutions to prevent, reduce and eliminate pollution in concert with programs for managing water resources." (ld., § 1251(g).) Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1341) requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in a discharge into navigable waters to provide the licensing or permitting federal agency with certification that the project will comply with state water quality laws. (Id., § 1341(a)(1), (d).) The state's certification may set conditions implementing Clean Water Act requirements, including the requirements of Section 303 of the Clean Water Act for water quality standards and implementation plans, or to implement "any other appropriate requirement of State law." (ld. § 1341(d).) Section 401 further provides that certification conditions shall become conditions of any federal license or permit for the project. (lbid.) If the state agency denies certification, the federal agency cannot approve the project.
The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) is the state agency responsible for Section 401 certification in California. (Wat. Code, § 13160.) The State Water Board has delegated authority to act on applications for certification to the Executive Director of the State Water Board. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3838, subd. (a).)
In addition, Water Code section 13383 provides the State Water Board with the authority to "establish monitoring, inspection, entry, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements… and [obtain] other information as may be reasonably required" for activities subject to certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act that involve the diversion of water for beneficial use. The State Water Board delegated this authority to the Deputy Director of the Division of Water Rights (Deputy Director), as provided for in State Water Board Resolution No. 2012-0029 (State Water Board 2012). In the Redelegation of Authorities Pursuant to Resolution No. 2012-0029 memo issued by the Deputy Director on October 19, 2017, this authority is redelegated to the Assistant Deputy Directors of the Division of Water Rights (State Water Board 2017a).
YCWA filed an application for water quality certification (certification) with the State Water Board under section 401 of the Clean Water Act for the Project on August 24, 2017 (YCWA 2017c). State Water Board staff provided public notice of the application pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 3858, by posting information describing the Project on the State Water Board's website on September 21, 2017. On July 31, 2019, the State Water Board denied YCWA's most recent application for certification without prejudice (YCWA 2018e), as YCWA had not yet initiated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process, which was delayed in part due to pending information associated with federal Endangered Species

Act (ESA) consultation regarding the impact of the Project and other hydroelectric facilities in the watershed.

On August 22, 2019, YCWA filed a petition with FERC, alleging that the State Water Board had waived its certification authority. On May 21, 2020, FERC issued an order granting YCWA's petition and asserting that the State Water Board had waived its certification authority. On June 20, 2020, the State Water Board filed a request for rehearing with FERC, requesting FERC reconsider its May 21, 2020 order finding waiver of the State Water Board's certification authority. The State Water Board's petition included a draft certification.
On July 7, 2020, State Water Board staff requested comments from the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (Central Valley Regional Water Board) on the draft certification. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 53855, subd. (b)(2)(B).) On July 16, 2020, comments were received from the Central Valley Regional Water Board on the draft certification. The comments have been incorporated into the final certification.

2.2 Water Quality Control Plans and Related Authorities The State Water Board's certification for the Project must ensure compliance with the water quality standards in the Central Valley Regional Water Board's Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River Basin and the San Joaquin River Basin (SR/SJR Basin Plan) (Central Valley Regional Water Board 2018) and the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/ Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan) (State Water Board 2018). Water quality control plans designate the beneficial uses of water that are to be protected (such as municipal and industrial, agricultural, and fish and wildlife beneficial uses), water quality objectives for the reasonable protection of the beneficial uses and the prevention of nuisance, and a program of implementation to achieve the water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, §§ 13241, 13050, subds. (h), (j).) The beneficial uses, together with the water quality objectives contained in the water quality control plans, and applicable federal anti-degradation requirements, constitute California's water quality standards for purposes of the Clean Water Act. In issuing water quality certification for a project, the State Water Board must ensure consistency with the designated beneficial uses of waters affected by the project, the water quality objectives developed to protect those uses, and anti-degradation requirements. (PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Dept. of Ecology (1994) 511 U.S. 700, 714-719.)
The nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards) have primary responsibility for the formulation and adoption of water quality control plans for their respective regions, subject to State Water Board and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) approval, as appropriate. (Wat. Code, § 13240 et seq.) As noted above, the State Water Board may also adopt water quality control plansß, which will supersede regional water quality control plans for the same waters to the extent of any conflict. (Id., § 13170.) Water quality control plans are updated a triannual basis

6 For example, the Bay-Delta Plan (State Water Board 2018).

10

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project July 2020 Final Water Quality Certification
which includes public input and reevaluation of designated and potential beneficial uses and water quality objectives.
In March 2019, the State Water Board submitted to FERC the plans and policies included in the State's comprehensive plan for orderly and coordinated control, protection, conservation, development, and utilization of the water resources of the State. The submission includes the SR/SJR Basin Plan and the Bay-Delta Plan.
Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers Basin Plan
The Central Valley Regional Water Board adopted, and the State Water Board and USEPA approved, the SR/SJR Basin Plan. The SR/SJR Basin Plan designates the beneficial uses of water to be protected along with the water quality objectives necessary to protect those uses. The SR/SJR Basin Plan identifies beneficial uses for surface waters in the Yuba River, including sources to Englebright Reservoir: municipal and domestic supply; irrigation; stock watering; power; contact recreation; canoeing and rafting; other noncontact recreation; cold freshwater habitat; cold spawning habitat; and wildlife habitat. The SR/SJR Basin Plan identifies beneficial uses for surface waters in the Yuba River, from Englebright Dam to the Feather River, as: irrigation; stock watering; power; contact recreation; canoeing and rafting; other noncontact recreation; warm freshwater habitat; cold freshwater habitat; warm water migration; cold water migration; cold spawning habitat; warm spawning habitat; and wildlife habitat.
Bay-Delta Plan
The Bay-Delta Plan establishes water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta) and tributary watersheds, including drinking water supply, irrigation supply, and fish and wildlife. The State Water Board adopts the Bay-Delta Plan pursuant to its authorities under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code, § 13000 et seq.) and the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1313).
The State Water Board has historically developed the water quality control plan for the Bay-Delta for several reasons. The Bay-Delta is a critically important natural resource that is both the hub of California's water supply system and the most valuable estuary and wetlands system on the West Coast. As diversions of water within and upstream of the Bay-Delta Estuary are a driver of water quality in the Bay-Delta watershed, much implementation of the Bay-Delta Plan relies on the combined water quality and water right authority of the State Water Board. In addition, the Bay-Delta falls within the boundaries of two Regional Water Boards. Having the State Water Board develop and adopt a water quality control plan that crosses Regional Water Board boundaries ensures a coordinated approach.
The beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta Plan are: municipal and domestic supply; industrial service supply; industrial process supply; agricultural supply; groundwater recharge; navigation; water contact recreation; non-contact water recreation; shellfish harvesting; commercial and sport fishing; warm freshwater habitat; cold freshwater habitat; migration of aquatic organisms; spawning, reproduction, and/or early

11

Yuba River Development Project July 2020
Final Water Quality Certification
development; estuarine habitat; wildlife habitat; and rare, threatened, or endangered
species.
The existing Bay-Delta Plan does not allocate responsibility of meeting objectives to water diverters in the Yuba River; however, the State Water Board is developing Bay- Delta Plan amendments focused on the Sacramento River and its tributaries (including the Yuba River), Delta eastside tributaries, Delta outflows, and interior Delta flows. This effort is referred to as the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-Delta Plan. Protection of the Bay-Delta ecosystem and its native aquatic species requires an integrated approach to effectively connect upstream suitable cold water nursery habitat, floodplains, tidal marshland, and turbid open water habitats in the Delta and Bay - and to connect those environments to the ocean. Accordingly, the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-Delta Plan would provide for a flow regime that supports a connected and functioning ecosystem linking and integrating inflow, cold water habitat, Delta outflow, and interior Delta flow measures with complementary physical habitat restoration and other nonflow measures. Changes are proposed to the water quality objectives, including narrative and numeric flow objectives, and the program of implementation for those objectives, as well as changes to monitoring, reporting, and assessment requirements. All water users on Bay-Delta tributaries would bear responsibility for achieving the tributary flow objectives and for contributing to the Delta outflow objectives, including diverters upstream and in the Delta. The State Water Board is aware of, and encourages, the ongoing negotiations between interested stakeholders and various other state agencies to achieve voluntary solutions that may implement an updated Bay-Delta Plan. The State Water Board anticipates that YCWA a will file a request to amend this certification, as necessary, in order to implement any voluntary solution to meet updated Bay-Delta Plan requirements.

2.3 Clean Water Act Section 303(d) Listing The State Water Board listed portions of the Yuba River in the California's 2014 and in 2016 California Integrated Report (Clean Water Act Section 303(d) List / 505(b) Report) (2014/2016 Integrated Report) (State Water Board 2017a) as follows:
New Bullards Bar Reservoir is listed for mercury; North Yuba River below New Bullards Bar Reservoir is listed for mercury;
North Yuba River and the Middle Yuba River confluence to Englebright Reservoir
are listed for chromium and mercury;
Englebright Reservoir is listed for mercury; Oregon Creek is listed for copper and iron; and Yuba River below Englebright Dam is listed for copper and mercury.
Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) to be developed for impaired water bodies. TMDLs are written plans that define the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive without exceeding water quality standards and establish load allocations for point and nonpoint sources of
pollution.

2.4 Construction General Permit
YCWA has proposed several construction projects that have the potential to disturb soil. YCWA will need to obtain coverage under the General Permit for Stormwater
Discharges Associated with Construction and Land Disturbance Activities
(Construction General Permit) (State Water Board 2009) for activities that disturb one
or more acres of soil or whose projects disturb less than one acre but are part of a larger common plan of development that in total disturbs one or more acres. Construction activities subject to the Construction General Permit includes clearing, grading, and disturbances to the ground, such as stockpiling or excavation, but does not include regular maintenance activities performed to restore the original line, grade, or capacity of the facility.

2.5 State Wetland Definition and Procedures for Discharges of Dredged or Fill Material to Waters of the State
On April 2, 2019, the State Water Board adopted the State Wetland Definition and Procedures for Discharges of Dredged or Fill Material to Waters of the State8 (Procedures) (State Water Board 2019), which became effective on May 28, 2020. The Procedures provide California's definition of wetland, wetland delineation procedures, and procedures for submitting applications for activities that could result in discharges of dredged or fill material to waters of the state. The Procedures ensure that State Water Board regulatory activities will result in no net loss of wetland quantity, quality, or permanence, compliant with the California Wetlands Conservation Policy, Executive Order VV-59-93. YCWA must comply with the Procedures when conducting dredge or fill activities that may impact waters of the state, including wetlands.

2.6 Aquatic Weed Control General Permit The Statewide National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for Residual Aquatic Pesticide Discharges to Waters of the United States from Algae and Aquatic Weed Control Applications (Aquatic Weed Control General Permit)9 (State Water Board 2013) applies to projects that require aquatic weed management activities.

practices to protect water quality from pesticide and herbicide use associated with aquatic weed control.

2.7 Statewide Mercury Provisions On May 2, 2017, the State Water Board adopted Resolution No. 2017-0027, which approved Part 2 of the Water Quality Control Plan for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries of California-Tribal and Subsistence Fishing Beneficial Uses and Mercury Provisions.10 Resolution No. 2017-0027 provides a consistent regulatory approach throughout the state by setting mercury limits to protect the beneficial uses associated with the consumption of fish by both people and wildlife. The State Water Board also established definitions for the following three new beneficial use definitions (tribal traditional culture, tribal subsistence fishing, and subsistence fishing) for use by the State Water Board and Regional Water Boards. The State Water Board also approved one narrative and four numeric mercury objectives to apply to inland surface waters, enclosed bays, and estuaries of the state that have any of the following beneficial use definitions: commercial and sport fishing, tribal traditional culture, tribal subsistence fishing, wildlife habitat, marine habitat, preservation of rare and endangered species, warm freshwater habitat, cold freshwater habitat, estuarine habitat, or inland saline water habitat, with the exception of waterbodies or waterbody segments with site-specific mercury objectives. These provisions will be implemented through National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits, water quality certifications, waste discharge requirements, and waivers of waste discharge
requirements.

3.0 California Environmental Quality Act
YCWA is the lead agency for the purposes of CEQA compliance. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 - 21177). The State Water Board is a responsible agency for the Project. As of the date of certification, YCWA has not initiated the CEQA process by issuing a Notice of Preparation and has not certified an environmental impact report in compliance with CEQA requirements. On June 29, 2020, Governor Newsom signed into law, amendments to the Water Code that provide the State Water Board with the authority to issue certifications before completion of CEQA review, where waiting until completion of CEQA review presents a substantial risk of waiver of certification authority. See Wat. Code, section 13160, subd. (b)(2), as amended by Stats. 2020, ch. 18, § 9.
Here, FERC issued an order on May 21, 2020, approving YCWA's request to find that the State Water Board has waived certification, even though the State Water Board took steps to preserve its certification authority and could not have issued certification any sooner because YCWA has not prepared the necessary CEQA documents. The State Water Board disagrees with FERC's decision and has requested rehearing. Nevertheless, FERC's decision highlights the potential for certification to be waived if the State Water Board waits to issue certification until completion of CEQA, even

though the timing of CEQA review is under control of the applicant, not the State Water Board. Issuance of this certification will become effective only if the FERC order is
overturned.

The issuance of this certification does not obviate YCWA's or the State Water Board's
obligations under CEQA, and the State Water Board, pursuant to Water Code section
13160, subdivision (b)(1), reserves authority to reopen and revise this certification "as appropriate to incorporate feasible measures to avoid or reduce significant environmental impacts or to make any necessary findings based on the information provided in the environmental document prepared for the project." If the State Water Board exercises this authority, it will file a Notice of Determination with the State Clearinghouse within five days of issuance of an amended certification.

4.0 Rationale for Water Quality Certification Conditions
Water development projects in the Yuba River Basin, including the Project, have resulted in flow reductions and alterations that adversely affect water quality. Similarly, water development projects throughout the Sacramento River Basin, including the Project, have adversely altered flows in the larger stream system and the Bay-Delta. The certification conditions were developed to ensure that the Project complies with water quality requirements and other appropriate requirements of state law, including protecting beneficial uses of California's waters by complying with water quality objectives in water quality control plans and other applicable water quality requirements. Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1341) provides that this certification's conditions be incorporated as mandatory conditions of the new license issued by FERC for the Project.

When preparing the conditions in this certification, State Water Board staff reviewed and
considered:

• - YCWA's applications for certification (YCWA 2017c and YCWA 2018e);
ii. YCWA's Amended FLA and associated updates thereto (listed and cited earlier
in the document);

Other information in the record.

The following describes the rationale used to develop the conditions in this certification.
Rationale for Flows, Ramping Rates, and Spill Reductions Instream flows provide habitat for fish and wildlife, contribute to scenic and aesthetic qualities of natural settings, and help support beneficial uses and water quality objectives for surface waters as established in the SR/SJR Basin Plan. The approach for developing flow requirements, including ramping rates and spill reductions (Conditions 1, 2, and 5), for Project-affected stream reaches included consideration of the aquatic-dependent biota (primarily fish, amphibians, benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI), and riparian vegetation) that are currently and/or potentially present, hydroelectric energy generation, and water supply. This includes an evaluation of ecosystem conditions under existing and unimpaired streamflow using the operations model11 and technical information developed during Project relicensing (including study
results from relicensing studies). Additionally, potential future changes in precipitation/snowmelt magnitude and timing were also considered as flows were
developed.
During relicensing, YCWA and most relicensing participants reached agreement on minimum instream flows (MIFs) for the Middle Yuba River below Our House Diversion Dam (Table 3) and Oregon Creek below Log Cabin Diversion Dam (Table 2), as well as ramping rates (Condition 2). State Water Board staff participated in relicensing discussions regarding these Project-related MIFs. Condition 1 requires MIFs for the Middle Yuba River and Oregon Creek that are designed to protect and enhance environmental and public resources and are consistent with those proposed by YCWA. Condition 2 requires implementation of YCWA-proposed ramping rates for better protection and enhancement of salmonid fry, spring-run Chinook salmon and steelhead redds, and riparian recruitment.
However, during relicensing, YCWA and relicensing participants could not reach agreement on MIFs for the North Yuba River below New Bullards Bar Reservoir or the lower Yuba River below Englebright Dam. Relicensing participants had differing views on MIFs that would be needed to protect and enhance environmental resources, water
supply, and hydroelectric energy generation.

11 The operations model was developed by YCWA using Microsoft Excel. The model uses the USACE's Hydrologic Engineering Center Data Storage System as a platform for input and output timeseries storage and management. The model has the capability of simulating various time periods (e.g., years to a single day) using 41 years of hydrology (i.e., Water Years 1970 through 2010).

16

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project July 2020 Final Water Quality Certification
The current flow regime in the lower Yuba River is governed by the Yuba Accord. The Yuba Accord is a set a of agreements designed to address the interests of environmental groups, agriculture, water agencies, and hydroelectric operators relying on water from the Yuba River. The Yuba Accord flows were designed to allow for freshwater flows to support summer holding habitat for spring-run Chinook salmon while also providing water for hydropower, water transfers, and irrigation. The Yuba Accord flows took effect in 2008 after two years as a pilot project, and the flows were contemplated to remain in effect until issuance of a new FERC license. At YCWA's request, the Project's consumptive water rights were amended to require the Yuba Accord flows.
YCWA proposes continued implementation of the Yuba Accord flows with minor
alterations, such as changes to ramping rates and water year type determinations in Schedule 5, Schedule 6, and Conference Years. Additionally, FERC's staff alternative modified YCWA's proposal to provide additional flow in the lower Yuba River from June through August 31 in Schedule 6 years, and additional flow in the North Yuba River from June 1 through September 30 in all water years. YCWA's implementation of the Yuba Accord flows in the lower Yuba River has provided improved conditions in the lower Yuba River compared to the conditions prior to Yuba Accord implementation. However, there is uncertainty as to the impact of YCWA's proposed changes to the Yuba Accord flows, and additional modifications may be needed to better address the Project's impacts to the Yuba River and aquatic resources over the term of the license (such as those proposed by CDFW in its 10(j) conditions). There are indications that YCWA's flow proposal for the lower Yuba River below Englebright Dam may not adequately provide for:
Holding temperatures for spring-run Chinook salmon in Schedule 6 years; Floodplain inundation during the winter and spring juvenile salmonid growth period;
Juvenile salmonid habitat in the early growth period, which may trigger early or premature outmigration of juvenile salmonids; and Spill reductions for natural riparian regeneration following spring flows.
There is evidence that additional alterations to lower Yuba River flows and flows below New Bullards Bar may be needed to better address the Project's impacts on aquatic resources, water quality objectives, and beneficial uses. A more detailed description of potential insufficiencies with YCWA's flow proposal is included in CDFW's 10j, Section 3.4.8 Rationale for Flow and Aquatic Resources Conditions - Minimum Instream Flows in the Lower Yuba River (CDFW 2017, Recommended Conditions 2.5 and 2.6), and 3.4.6 Rationale for Flow and Aquatic Resources Conditions - Minimum Instream Flows in the North Yuba River Downstream of New Bullards Bar Dam.
Additional assessment is needed to determine required alterations to lower Yuba River flows and North Yuba River flows below New Bullards Bar given proposed changes to YCWA's flow and ramping proposals and changes made by the FERC's staff alternative. Further consultation is also needed with YCWA and state and federal
agencies to fully assess current and potential future flow alterations in the lower Yuba River and North Yuba River. To allow for assessment of these changes and for

17

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project July 2020
Final Water Quality Certification
additional consultation, Condition 1 requires YCWA to initiate consultation on flows with CDFW, USFWS, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), State Water Board staff,
and, if applicable, the USFS. Such consultation would occur no later than 10 years
following license issuance, or earlier at the direction of the Deputy Director based on review of environmental monitoring data (Condition 4) and/or adoption of any future amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan that address flows in the Sacramento River and its tributaries, including any State Water Board-approved voluntary solutions. The if consultation shall also address what, if any, Project operational changes must be
implemented.
This consultation term permits YCWA to move forward with its proposed flow regime as modified by FERC's staff alternative, and gather data to determine whether it will adequately comply with water quality requirements over the longer term.
The flow requirements in this certification include YCWA's proposed changes to the flows required in the consumptive water rights for the Project in Revised Decision 1644 and State Water Board Order No. 2008-0014. When the resulting consumptive water right flow requirements and this certification differ, YCWA remains obligated to implement the greater of the flow requirements, in order to remain in compliance with
both requirements.
Rationale for Water Year Type Definition YCWA proposed two conditions defining water year type classifications: (1) for reaches above Englebright Reservoir; and (2) for reaches below the Narrows 2 Powerhouse. Due to the different management approaches used for the two reaches, two water year
classifications are suitable (Condition 3).
While use of YCWA's proposed water year classifications are suitable for the Project, they include minor changes from the classifications used in triggering flow requirements under YCWA's consumptive use rights, as described in Revised Decision 1644 and State Water Board Order No. 2008-0014. Absent a water right change petition, these consumptive use requirements remain unchanged. When the resulting water year type- based flow minimums differ between the consumptive use rights and this certification, YCWA remains obligated to implement the greater of the flow requirements, in order to remain in compliance with both requirements.
Rationale for Monitoring and Management Monitoring and management plans aim to develop information regarding aquatic resources in the lower Yuba River in response to changes in flow conditions anticipated in the new license. The monitoring plans include monitoring for water temperature, water quality, salmonids, stream fish, BMI, foothill yellow-legged frogs, western pond turtles, sediment, riparian vegetation, LWM, bald eagles, and compliance with flows and reservoir levels. The methods and frequency of monitoring are designed to measure the response of resources to adjustments in streamflow and other conditions and to determine whether resource objectives are being met. These conditions also allow the Deputy Director, based on reporting and other information, the flexibility to require

18

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project
Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

adaptive management actions and to alter the monitoring program methodologies or frequencies of data collection.
Water quality (Condition 4A) and water temperature (Condition 4B) monitoring are important to determine compliance with state and federal water quality standards and examine long-term trends in water quality. The objectives of the water quality and water
temperature monitoring plans are to monitor water quality conditions, including temperature, in Project reservoirs and impoundments and Project-affected reaches of the North, Middle, and Yuba rivers, as well as Oregon Creek, a tributary to the Middle Yuba River. Additionally, annual water temperature monitoring (Condition 4B) will provide information needed to determine whether cold freshwater beneficial uses are being protected.
Upper Yuba River Aquatic Monitoring (Condition 4C) provides for aquatic resource monitoring for all Project-affected stream reaches and reservoirs upstream of Englebright Reservoir, including New Bullards Bar Reservoir, the North Yuba River below New Bullards Bar Dam, Our House Diversion Dam Impoundment, the Middle Yuba River below Our House Diversion Dam, Log Cabin Diversion Dam Impoundment, Oregon Creek below Log Cabin Diversion Dam, and the Yuba River between the North Yuba River/Middle Yuba River confluence and Englebright Reservoir.
Lower Yuba River Aquatic Monitoring (Condition 4D) was collaboratively developed by YCWA, CDFW, USFWS, and other Project relicensing participants. This plan is designed to determine if implementation of the new license provides the desired resource protection, mitigation, and enhancement of ecological resources in the lower Yuba River The methods and frequency of monitoring described in the plan will measure the response of resources to adjustments in streamflow and other conditions over the term of the new FERC license.

The Bald Eagle and American Peregrine Falcon Management Plan (Condition 4E), proposed by YCWA, is designed to ensure that Project operations and maintenance, as well as Project-related recreation activities do not result in "take" of bald eagles, their eggs, or nests. YCWA will implement measures to protect bald eagles, their eggs, and nests, consistent with federal and state laws and regulations.
Compliance with required flows and reservoir levels requires accurate and reliable gaging. Streamflow and reservoir level gages must be in place and functioning to document compliance with license conditions. In addition to ensuring adequate gaging tools for this Project, implementation of the Streamflow and Reservoir Level Compliance Monitoring Plan identified in Condition 4F will provide information needed for interpretation of monitoring results and inform potential adaptive management measures.

New Bullards Bar Dam, Our House Division Dam, and Log Cabin Diversion Dam inhibit natural movement and recruitment of LWM into the North Yuba, Middle Yuba, and Oregon Creek. Condition 8 requires passage of LWM downstream of Our House and Log Cabin Diversion Dams on the Middle Yuba and Oregon Creek as proposed by

19

Exhibit B

YCWA in GS3: Implement Our House and Log Cabin Diversion Dams and New Bullards Bar Reservoir Woody Material Management Plan (GS3). Condition 8 also requires YCWA to update GS3 to address water quality during proposed burning of LWM on a barge in New Bullards Bar.
Aquatic invasive species cause harm to the diversity and abundance of native species through competition for resources, predation, parasitism, interbreeding with native populations, transmitting diseases, or causing physical or chemical changes to habitats. The impacts of aquatic invasive species can affect the overall function of aquatic ecosystems. Currently, several known aquatic invasive species exist within the Project area and several more are known to occur nearby. USFS, USFWS, and CDFW worked collaboratively with YCWA to develop the Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan (Condition 11) for the Project and YCWA filed it with FERC on November 8, 2019 (YCWA 2019). Implementation of the Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan is needed to minimize and prevent the introduction and establishment of aquatic invasive species, reduce the spread of existing aquatic invasive species, and monitor for aquatic invasive species in Project reservoirs and stream reaches. The plan is also designed to increase awareness and educate the public on aquatic invasive species impacts, prevention measures, and management approaches. In addition, Condition 11 requires YCWA to implement the decontamination protocol referenced in the plan for any activities that require moving equipment from one waterbody to another waterbody to help prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.
Project facilities operations affect the streamflow and modify aquatic habitats. Native fish evolved with seasonal flow regimes that no longer exist below the Project dams. Fish in New Bullards Bar Reservoir are also at risk of entrainment into Project facilities if during drought years if the reservoir elevation approaches the FERC minimum pool and fish concentrate seeking thermal refugee in the reservoir. Under normal Project operations reservoir drawdown in the spring can create potential barriers to fish movement from New Bullards Bar Reservoir into tributaries. As the Project has created impoundments such as New Bullards Bar Reservoir, reservoir fishing opportunities have also been created. New Bullards Bar Reservoir is a popular location for recreational fishery. YCWA actively manages and stocks New Bullards Bar Reservoir with fish for recreational fishing. New Bullards Bar Reservoir Fishery (Condition 13) requires YCWA to continue to maintain the recreational fishery in New Bullards Bar Reservoir in consultation with CDFW and the State Water Board.
Implementation of a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (Condition 17) is essential to ensuring hazardous materials are properly stored, used, transported, and managed in the Project area to avoid and minimize the release of hazardous materials to water, and the associated impacts to beneficial uses, including impacts to sensitive species and their habitats. Condition 17 requires YCWA to implement its proposed Hazardous Materials Management Plan to address the storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials.

20

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

Rationale for Closures at Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel
YCWA will be required to close the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel and allow the unaltered flows to continue downstream during specific times of the year. Closure of the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel (Condition 6) will help minimize Project-related flow fluctuations that are uncharacteristic of the natural hydrograph and help protect biota. CDFW has determined that under certain conditions, entrainment of aquatic organisms, including rainbow trout and potentially other native fish and frog species, occurs at a rate greater than 30 percent into Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel. This entrainment results in a net loss of aquatic resources from the stream reaches of the Middle Yuba River, upstream and downstream of Our House Diversion Dam (CDFW 2017). Entrainment of fish and other aquatic species into the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel reduces population recruitment and limits or fragments the aquatic genetic diversity in the watershed (CDFW 2017). Fish that would normally pass downstream of this facility and re-populate fish populations are lost due to Project-related entrainment. Requiring closure of the Lohman Ridge Diversion Tunnel during peak entrainment timeframes (i.e., fall and spring) will help to reduce entrainment.
Rationale for Use of New Colgate Powerhouse Intake When ambient air temperatures are cool, using the low-level outlet on New Bullards Bar Dam depletes water from the cold-water pool in the reservoir. As a result of this depletion of the cold-water pool, the downstream temperatures throughout the lower Yuba River may rise in the fall months when spring-run Chinook salmon spawn. Condition 7 is designed to save cold water for later in the year (i.e., fall) by requiring use of the upper intake in the spring. This condition will help improve water temperatures in the Middle and lower Yuba River and allow for greater growth and reproduction of both stream and anadromous salmonids.

Rationale for Sediment Management
Sediment is critical to the function of river ecosystems, as it provides habitat for fish it spawning, BMI production, and frog reproduction. Sediment deposition during gradual flow reductions can form side channel bars that provide channel margin habitat, which is necessary for fish, amphibians, and BMI. Sediment accumulation behind the Log Cabin Diversion Dam and Our House Diversion Dam is a long-standing and ongoing issue. In 2016 and 2020, the State Water Board issued certifications for sediment management actions (i.e., sluicing and dredging) at Log Cabin Division Dam and Our House Diversion Dam. The purpose of the sediment management actions is to allow for removal of accumulated sediment behind these two diversion dams. The purpose of the Log Cabin and Our House Diversion Dams Sediment Management Plan (Condition 9) is to prescribe procedures and guidelines for the management of sediment behind Log Cabin Diversion Dam and Our House Diversion Dam throughout the term of the new FERC license.

Rationale for Prevention of Narrows Reach Fish Stranding Events
Coordinated operations between the Project (specifically the Narrows 2 Powerhouse, including bypass facilities) and the Narrows Hydroelectric Project's Narrows 1 Powerhouse have a history of stranding fish, including spring-run Chinook salmon (a state- and federally-listed threatened species) and fall-run Chinook salmon (a California

21

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

species of special concern and NMFS species of concern). Stranding occurs in the reach of the lower Yuba River below Englebright Dam to the Narrows 1 Powerhouse (CDFW 2017). Coordinated operations have caused lethal and sub-lethal effects to salmonids due to false attraction/delay, stranding, and redd dewatering (NMFS 2017). In 2015, the State Water Board issued a certification for the Narrows 2 Isolation Pool Restoration Project, which specifically addressed potential salmonid stranding
associated with a gravel bar and flow fluctuations between the Narrows 2 and
Narrows 1 powerhouses, as a result of Project operations. Condition 10 requires YCWA to develop and implement a plan to reduce fish stranding between the Narrows-1 and 2 powerhouses throughout the term of the new FERC Project license. This plan will emphasize protection of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout and include permanent or
long-term measures.

Rationale for Restoration Restoration activities such as lowering floodplain surfaces, planting riparian vegetation, LWM management, and/or gravel augmentation (Condition 12) will help improve the quantity, quality, and complexity of salmonid rearing habitat in the lower Yuba River. Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon are listed as threatened under the federal ESA and the California ESA and steelhead trout are listed as threatened under the federal ESA. The status of both species on the Yuba River is in decline. Low return numbers and failure to support or restore fish populations are the result of many factors, including low-quality juvenile rearing habitat, lack of LWM and instream cover, lack of riparian overstory, reduced invertebrate food sources, and lack of access to floodplain
habitat.

Riparian vegetation constitutes an important resource that can provide cover for juvenile salmonids and support invertebrate prey for salmonids. Regulated rivers often lack riparian floodplain and riparian overstory due to conditions that severely limit riparian regeneration and diminish or constrain available area for tree establishment. The Project contributes to the low quality and quantity of salmonid rearing habitat available in the Yuba River. Dams used in the Project block fish passage that make upstream habitat unavailable and Project flows have reduced floodplain and riparian corridor inundation and connectivity, which decreases the availability of rearing habitat in the bank and floodplain zones and suppresses the establishment of the riparian community.
The lower Yuba River generally lacks riparian floodplain and riparian overstory as well as LWM. LWM contributes to productive aquatic ecosystems and is an important component of stream channel maintenance and the formation of complex aquatic habitat along stream margins and in active river channels. Presently, LWM is impounded in the Project's reservoirs. For this reason, LWM of the size capable of influencing channel morphology is largely absent downstream of the Project's
reservoirs.

Rationale for Recreation Facilities YCWA proposes to implement a Recreation Facilities Plan (Condition 14), which would expand existing recreation facilities and develop new facilities to increase and improve recreation opportunities. The overall purpose of the Recreation Facilities Plan is to

22

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

provide appropriate protection, mitigation, and enhancement measures relating to recreation, which includes implementation of measures to protect of water quality.
Rationale for Technical Review Group and Annual Meetings
The formation of a Technical Review Group (TRG) (Condition 22) will facilitate communication and ensure that interested parties have an opportunity to discuss license implementation. The condition requires that YCWA organize and host TRG meetings, with at least one meeting to be held each year in April. The TRG meetings will provide an opportunity for communication and coordination between YCWA, resource agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other interested parties.
Rationale for Whitewater Boating Flows Whitewater boating opportunities are available downstream of the Project's facilities and these opportunities generally occur during spring and early summer months, when river flows a can vary greatly as a result of rainfall and snowmelt. The major constraint for boaters' use is a lack of predictable flows in the Middle Yuba River upstream of Our House Diversion Dam (YCWA 2017a). As a result, YCWA a has proposes to provide predictable flows below Our House Diversion Dam on weekend days. Condition 15 requires implementation of YCWA's proposed whitewater flows.
Rationale for Drought Management
Developing and implementing a Drought Management Plan (Condition 16) is important for successful management of water resources to protect all beneficial uses in California's extremely variable climate, including extended drought. Multiple, successive dry years present difficult choices between releasing reservoir water to meet immediate demands (e.g., deliveries and instream flow requirements) or storing reservoir water for a future year to address the risk of additional dry year(s). The Drought Management Plan will identify strategies for managing water during times of extreme shortage.
Rationale for Coordinated Operations Plan with Narrows Hydroelectric Project Both the Project and Narrows Hydroelectric Project receive water from Englebright Reservoir. However, these two projects are operated under two different FERC licenses. Condition 18 requires YCWA to develop a plan to coordinate operations of the projects to ensure implementation of the flow-related conditions in the Project license, including maintenance of flow requirements and ramping rates during normal operations, scheduled outages, and unscheduled outages (to the extent feasible).
Rationale for Construction and Maintenance
Protection of the instream beneficial uses identified in the SR/SJR Basin Plan requires effluent limitations and other limitations on discharges of pollutants from point and nonpoint sources to the Yuba River and its tributaries. Erosion from Project-related construction and maintenance activities has the potential to result in discharges that violate water quality standards. Condition 19 requires YCWA to comply with the Construction General Permit, as applicable, or to develop and implement Water Quality Monitoring and Protection Plans (WQMP Plans) to protect water quality and beneficial uses. WQMP Plans will be developed for construction and maintenance activities with

23

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

the potential to cause erosion, stream sedimentation, release of hazardous materials, or otherwise impair water quality that are not covered by another condition of the certification.

As part of relicensing, YCWA proposed implementation of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan to minimize Project-related erosion and sedimentation. The plan covers ground-disturbing activities associated with routine Project-related operations, maintenance, and new construction that could produce sedimentation issues near streams or reservoirs. The plan includes best management practices (BMPs) to control site-specific erosion and sedimentation as well as emergency erosion control measures and protocols to control sedimentation during or after severe storm events. This plan has been integrated into a broader condition related to Construction and Maintenance (Condition 19) associated with the Project.
Rationale for Fish Passage The Yuba Salmon Forum is a collaborative process that began in 2011, and is comprised of state and federal agencies, hydroelectric operators in the watershed (including YCWA), municipalities, and nongovernmental organizations. The purpose of the Yuba Salmon Forum is to evaluate and recommend implementation actions that could result in sustainable populations of salmonids in the Yuba River watershed and contribute to recovery goals. As part of the Central Valley salmonid recovery plan, the Yuba Salmon Forum considers other beneficial uses of water resources and habitat values in neighboring watersheds. Actions considered by the Yuba Salmon Forum included fish reintroduction above Englebright Dam, and the group completed initial evaluation of six fish passage alternatives, as well as an alternative for lower Yuba
River habitat improvements.
Englebright Dam is the upper limit of anadromy on the Yuba River. Though Englebright Dam is owned by USACE, YCWA's Project operations rely on Englebright Dam to support peaking hydroelectric energy production at New Colgate and baseflow operations at Narrows 2 Powerhouse. The Project cannot operate as it has historically or proposed in its Amended FLA without use of Englebright Dam. Additionally, Project operations directly alter operations of Englebright Dam by reducing the duration and magnitude of spills from Englebright Dam and by controlling flows in the lower Yuba River. Additionally, prior to encountering Englebright Dam, anadromous fish are subject to Project impacts that affect flows in the lower Yuba River. As such, under current conditions, the Project directly impacts listed salmonids through its historic and proposed future operations. Condition 20 requires YCWA to develop a report that includes a proposal regarding fisheries reintroduction to reduce Project-related effects to listed salmonids.

Rationale for Mercury Management The Yuba River has been affected by historic gold mining activities including the use of mercury and hydrologic gold mining. Mercury deposits associated with historic gold mining activities remain in the Yuba River system and may be affected by Project operations and activities in a matter that causes impacts to water quality and/or human health impacts. Water quality and human health impacts may result from an increased

24

Exhibit B
Yuba River Development Project Final Water Quality Certification July 2020

amount or mobilization of methylmercury in the watershed. Additionally, Project reservoirs can increase the rate of mercury methylation allowing mercury to bioaccumulate in fish tissue and increase human health risk. During relicensing, YCWA evaluated methylmercury concentrations in fish tissue samples collected from the Yuba River. Forty-seven edible-sized fish were sampled, of which 43 of fish (91 percent) exceeded the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment's Advisory Tissue Levels for safe fish consumption for children and women. Analytical results from New Bullard Bar smallmouth bass tissue samples revealed concentrations of bioaccumulated mercury as high as 0.807 parts per million wet-weight, which is almost twice the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment's Advisory Tissue Levels for safe fish consumption for children and women. Condition 21 requires YCWA to evaluate its Project operations in relation to mercury and methylation of mercury and develop plans to address any Project-related impacts to mercury in compliance with the Tribal Subsistence Beneficial Uses and Mercury Provisions of the Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries (ISWEBE) Plan (State Water
Board 2017b).

Rationale for Conditions 23 - 50
This certification imposes additional conditions regarding monitoring, enforcement, and potential future revisions, to address issues likely to arise during the extended term of the new FERC license. These are necessary for a variety a of reasons, including: to ensure that the Project operates to meet water quality standards as anticipated over time; to ensure compliance with other relevant state and federal laws; to ensure that the Project will continue to meet state water quality standards and other appropriate requirements of state law during the extended license period; and to provide for adaptation of conditions in light of changing events, including the potential for voluntary solutions to implement the requirements associated with anticipated updated to the Bay- Delta Plan. Additionally, California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 3860 requires imposition of certain mandatory conditions for all certifications, which are included in this
certification.

5.0 Conclusion

The State Water Board finds that, with the conditions and limitations imposed under this certification, the proposed Project will comply with applicable state water quality standards and other appropriate requirements of state law.

1(B) Planned Temporary Flow Modifications
The Licensee may request temporary MIF variances for non-emergency facility construction, modification, or maintenance. Non-emergency variance requests shall be submitted to the Deputy Director for approval as far in advance as practicable, but no less than four months in advance of the desired effective date. The Licensee shall
notify the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) of the proposed temporary MIF variance. The request shall include: a description of the proposed construction, modification, or maintenance; the planned duration and magnitude of the MIF variance; documentation of notification to the USFS, CDFW, NMFS, and USFWS, and any comments received; measures that will be implemented to protect water quality and beneficial uses; and a schedule for the proposed construction, modification, or
maintenance. The Deputy Director may deny the request or require modifications as part of any approval. Upon Deputy Director approval, the Licensee shall provide public notice of the MIF variance. The Licensee shall file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the Deputy Director-approved temporary modifications to flow requirements and any approved amendments thereto.
1(C) Unplanned Temporary Flow Modifications
The flows specified in Condition 1 may be temporarily modified if required by equipment
malfunction reasonably beyond the control of the Licensee, as directed by law enforcement authorities, or in emergencies. An emergency is defined as an unforeseen event that is reasonably out of the control of the Licensee and requires the Licensee to take immediate action, either unilaterally or under instruction by law enforcement or other regulatory agency staff, to prevent imminent loss of human life or substantial property damage. An emergency may include, but is not limited to: natural events such as landslides, storms, or wildfires; vandalism; malfunction or failure of Project works; recreation accidents; or other public safety incidents. Drought is not considered an emergency for purposes of this condition. The Licensee shall make all reasonable efforts to promptly resume required flows.
When possible, the Licensee shall notify the Deputy Director prior to any unplanned temporary flow modification. In all instances, the Licensee shall notify the Deputy
Director within 24 hours of the beginning of any unplanned temporary streamflow modification. Within 96 hours of the beginning of any unplanned temporary streamflow modification, the Licensee shall provide the Deputy Director with an update of the conditions associated with the modification and an estimated timeline for returning to
the required MIFs.

Within 30 days of any unplanned temporary MIF modification, the Licensee shall provide the Deputy Director with: (1) a written description of the modification and
reason(s) for its necessity; (2) photo documentation of the emergency or reason for the streamflow modification; (3) a timeline for returning to the required MIF or timeline when the MIF resumed; (4) a description of corrective actions taken in response to an

31

Final Water Quality Certification
unplanned under-release of flow; and (5) a plan to prevent the need for modification of MIFs resulting from a similar emergency or event in the future.
1(D) Evaluation of Flows
After considering monitoring results from Condition 4 and other information associated
with conditions in this certification, and/or following adoption of any future amendments
to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan) (State Water Board 2018) addressing flows in the
Sacramento River and its tributaries (including those currently being developed under the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-Delta Plan), the Deputy Director may require
the Licensee to initiate consultation on flows with CDFW, USFWS, NMFS, State Water Board staff, and, if applicable, the USFS. Such consultation would determine whether the required flows are reasonably protective of water quality and beneficial uses in the Yuba River and Project-related tributaries and/or whether they meet the requirements of the Bay-Delta Plan. The consuitation shall also address what, if any, flow adjustments must be implemented. Consultation under this condition shall not be necessary if the Licensee enters into a State Water Board-approved comprehensive and long-term,
watershed-wide voluntary solution implementing such changes to the Sacramento/Delta
Update to the Bay-Delta Plan, and any updates to the certification necessary to implement the solution are incorporated into this certification.
If the above consultation and evaluation of MIFs does not occur within 10 years of license issuance, the Licensee shall initiate consultation with CDFW, USFWS, NMFS,
State Water Board staff, and, if applicable, the USFS. The consultation shall include discussions of: 1) all monitoring conducted through conditions of this certification that
pertain to environmental resources and Project flow releases by river reaches (i.e.,
North Yuba, Middle Yuba, Oregon Creek, and lower Yuba River (i.e., Yuba River below Englebright Dam)); 2) any adverse effects to environmental resources associated with Project flow releases; and 3) proposed updates to the flow schedules and/or identification of management actions to address adverse effects to environmental resources associated with Project flow releases.
Within six months of initiating consultation and no later than 11 years following license
issuance, the Licensee shall submit to the Deputy Director for review and consideration of approval: documentation of consultation and the consulting agencies' comments and recommendations; any changes to the flows and/or other management actions proposed by the Licensee; and a description of how any changes proposed by the Licensee incorporate or address the agencies comments and recommendations. The Deputy Director may approve the Licensee's proposal or require other changes to the
extent necessary to ensure reasonable protection of the beneficial uses. If changes to the flows are required, within 10 days of the Deputy Director's approval of the Licensee's proposal or changes thereto, the Licensee shall file a request with FERC to
amend the flow requirements and/or other management actions in the license. The Licensee shall implement the new flows and/or other management actions as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the Deputy Director's decision and any other
required approvals.

CONDITION 3. Water Year Types
3(A) Water Year Type Determination Upstream of Englebright Dam
The Licensee shall classify water year types and schedules according to this condition as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than 30 days after license issuance. For water year type determinations above Englebright Reservoir, the Licensee shall determine the water year type based on the criteria in Table 9. The Licensee shall determine the water year type in the months of February, March, April, May, and October based on the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) Bulletin 12012 forecast.

1 DWR rounds the Bulletin 120 forecast to the nearest thousands of acre-feet (TAF) to establish water year types in February, March, April and May. DWR rounds its Full Natural Flow calculation to establish water year types in October, to the nearest acre- foot; the Licensee shall round DWR's Full Natural Flow calculation in October to the
nearest TAF.

In each of the months of February, March, April, and May, the water year type shall be based on DWR's water year forecast of unimpaired runoff in the Yuba River at the Smartsville Gage No. 11418000 as established in DWR's Bulletin 120. DWR's Bulletin 120 as published in February, March, and April shall apply from the 16th day of that month through the 15th day of the next month. For example, Bulletin 120 published in the second week of February shall establish the water year type from February 16 through March 15. Additionally, from May 16 through October 15, the water year type shall be based on DWR's Bulletin 120 published in May,
From October 16 through February 15 of the following year, the water year type shall be based on the sum of DWR's monthly (not daily) full natural flow in the Yuba River for the

If DWR does not make the full natural flow available by October 15, the water year type shall be based on DWR's May Bulletin 120, until the full natural flow for the full prior water year is made available. The Licensee shall implement the required water year type determination within three days of the date when DWR makes the full natural flows for the full prior year available through February 15.
3(B) Water Year Type Classification Downstream of Englebright Dam
The Licensee shall use Bulletin 120 each year in each of the months of February, March, April, and May to determine the applicable water year type as described in Table 10, as defined in the North Yuba Index.

Table 10. North Yuba Index
Water Year Type Thousands of Acre-Feet
Schedule 1 Equal to or greater than 1,400
Schedule 2 Equal to or greater than 1,040 and less than 1,400
Schedule 3 Equal to or greater than 920 and less than 1,040
Schedule 4 Equal to or greater than 820 and less than 920
Schedule 5 Equal to or greater than 693 and less than 820
Schedule 6 Equal to or greater than 500 and less than 693
Conference Year Less than 500

The North Yuba Index shall be defined as follows:
North Yuba Index = SaNBB + = INBB, where: SaNBB is the actual recorded amount of water in storage in New Bullards Bar Reservoir on September 30 of the previous water year as reported for USGS Gage No. 11413515
minus 234,000 AF;
and
INBB is calculated as follows:
INBB = Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar Reservoir from October 1 to the end of Monthi-1 (Monthi-1 is the previous month) + Forecasted Inflow from Beginning of Month' (Monthi is the current month) to September 30,
where
Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar Reservoir from October 1 to the end of Monthi-1
is the calculated inflow in TAF based on a monthly summation of inflow as follows: Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar Reservoir from October 1 to the end of Monthi-1
= Monthly change in stored water + Monthly outflow and where:

The May calculation of Forecasted New Bullards Bar Inflow and subsequent updated calculations shall be reduced by the actual New Bullard Bar inflow between April 1 and the calculation date.

Formula terms are only applicable as shown in Table 11 (e.g., the March forecast does not include a term for forecasted February New Bullards Bar Inflow). The following formula shall be used to calculate the terms of the formula for Forecasted Inflow to NBBl
using the corresponding coefficients from Table 11):
February New Bullards Bar Inflow = C + C1 x Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar + C2 x Forecasted Smartsville(February)
March New Bullards Bar Inflow = C + C1 x Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar + C2 x Forecasted Smartsville(March)
April New Bullards Bar Inflow July New Bullards Bar Inflow = C + C1 x Total
Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar + C2 x Forecasted Smartsville(April - July) + C3 x Forecasted Goodyears Bar(April - July)
August New Bullards Bar Inflow September New Bullards Bar Inflow = C1 x
Total Actual Inflow to New Bullards Bar + C2 x Forecasted Smartsville(August -

STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

In the matter of: July 17, 2020 Water Quality Certification For Federal Permit Or License for Yuba County Water Agency Yuba River Development Project (FERC No. 2246)
YUBA COUNTY WATER AGENCY'S PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF JULY 17, 2020 WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL PERMIT OR LICENSE
Pursuant to title 23, section 3867, of the California Code of Regulations, Yuba
County Water Agency ("YCWA") hereby petitions for the State Water Resources Control
Board'e reconsideration of the Water Quality Certification For Federal Permit Or License,
for YCWA's Yuba River Development Project (FERC No. 2246) that the Executive Director
issued to YCWA on July 17, 2020 (the "Delegated Certification").

Executive Summary
In 1959, the Legislature created Yuba County Water Agency to serve Yuba County's
people by addressing the county's water problems, including deadly floods on the Yuba and
Feather Rivers and overdrafted groundwater basins. These problems had existed long
before 1959, largely because hydraulic mining in the 1800s had obliterated the Yuba River's
channel as a result of more mining debris being washed into the river's watershed than the
amount of earth moved to build the Panama Canal, YCWA has sought to address the
county's water problems mainly through its construction and operation of the Yuba River Development Project (the "YRDP"). Even though other water users export up to 33%-34%
of the watershed's runoff to other areas in dry and critically dry years, YCWA's operation of
its project has provided reliable surface water supplies for the county, which corrected the
prior groundwater overdraft. YCWA's operation of its project also addressed some of the
county's flooding problems, both because its New Bullards Bar Dam can reduce peak flood
flows and by generating revenue to provide a reliable source of local funding to support
levee repairs and other flood reduction efforts, Moreover, YCWA's operations have
improved conditions for salmon and steelhead in the lower Yuba River, which, before
YOWA's project, was such poor habitat for ealmon that the California Department of Fish
and Wildlife ("CDFW") would build a physical barrier across the river's mouth to prevent

(00180407.1)00180407.DOCX •1- 8/14/2020 7:58 AM

EXHIBIT D

salmon from migrating into it in the early fall. YCWA's responsibilities, however, are by no
means complete. The majority of Yuba County's communities are disadvantaged
communities whose economic progress and social advancement is restrained by, among
other variables, continuing flood risks. YCWA therefore needs to continue to responsibly
operate its project to address the county's water problems. YCWA also must continue to
supply surface water to sustainably manage the groundwater basins, as most Yuba County
public water supplies depend on it.
To continue to support Yuba County's communities, environment and economy,
YCWA is seeking a new 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC") to operate its project to generate hydroelectricity, provide reliable water supplies,
and continue to benefit the river's fish. YCWA has spent years in FERC's relicensing
process, in hundrede of meetings and conference calls with state and federal agencies and
stakeholders, and has spent tens of millions of dollars on environmental and other studies.
If, in the end, FERC were to issue a new multi-decade license for YCWA's project,
corresponding to the environmental impact statement that FERC prepared with the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, then YCWA would be able to continue its work to benefit Yuba
County and also provide meaningful benefits to much of California through water transfers
in dry years.
Unfortunately, the Delegated Certification will significantly impair YCWA's ability
to continue all of this work for the people of Yuba County, The extensive technical analyses
that YCWA is submitting with this Petition indicate that the Delegated Certification could
have a nearly $500 million impact over ‹ 50-year FERC license term on YCWA and its
capacity to support Yuba County's many disadvantaged communities - not counting
hundreds of millions of dollars more in potential fish-passage costs and the economic impact
on Yuba County's farmers from severely reduced surface-water supplies. The certification
could compel.YCWA to shoulder primary responsibility for improving fisheries habitat in
the lower Yuba River, even though YCWA's technical work shows that the certification's
terms actually might damage fish habitat conditions by, among other things, causing water
temperatures to exceed key thresholds for salmon more often. One of the Delegated
Certification's conditions, for example, could require YCWA to spend hundreds of millions
of dollars to move fish above the federal government's Englebright Dam - which was built
in the early 1940s to contain hydraulic mining debris. The Delegated Cortification presents
a dangerous financial risk to YCWA by potentially increasing annual expenses, and

100180407.1)00180401.DOCX -2- 8/74/2020 7:53 AM

• EXHIBIT D

decreasing hydroelectric and water-sale annual revenues, by many millions of dollars in

each direction. Facing such a serious pinch, YCWA would be forced to reduce its
expenditures on flood damage reduction projects, habitat and watershed restoration,
recreation, and community grants. Such an outcome would further burden vulnerable
populations in Yuba County's disadvantaged communities,
Finally, in violation of basic fair hearing, due process and open meeting
requirements, the Delegated Certification was issued with no public procese in which
YCWA could have demonstrated the certification's many problems. In fact, YCWA did not
even have an application for a water quality certification pending, making the Delegated
Certification invalid under the State Board's own regulations.
For these reasons, and the many others stated in the materials submitted with this
Petition, YCWA respectfully requests that the State Board grant reconsideration of the
Delegated Certification and promptly vacate it.

The State Board is requested to reconsider the issuance of the Delegated
Certification and vacate that certification in its entirety. A copy of the Delegated
Certification is attached to this Petition as Attachment P1.

3. The date on which the certification action or failure to act
occurred (Cal. Code Regs., title 28, § 3867, subd. (d)(8))

400180407.1100180407.DOCX -3- 8/14/2020 7:63 AM

+ EXHIBIT D

The Executive Director issued the Delegated Certification on July 17, 2020.

4. A full and complete statement of reasons why the action or failure to act was inappropriate or improper (Cal. Code Regs., title 23, § 3867, subd. (d)(4))

As explained in detail in the attached Statement of Reasone Why The Action Or
Failure To Act Was Inappropriate Or Improper (the "Statement") and the additional
materials submitted with this Petition, the issuance of the Delegated Certification was
inappropriate and improper because:
There was no legal authority for the Delegated Certification's issuance
because YOWA had no pending application for a water quality certification,
which is required by the State Board'a regulations before it issues such a
certification;
The regulations that authorize the Executive Director to take "all actiong" on
applications for water quality certifications, and the many sub-delegations to
State Board staff in the Delegated Certification, are invalid because the State
Board members hold a public trust to exercise their special judgment and
discretion in such matters and that trust cannot be delegated without explicit
authorization from the Legislature, which does not exist here;
The process by which the Delegated Certification was issued without public
proceedings in which YCWA and others could meet and address the relevant
evidence, and without a quorum of the State Board voting in an open
meeting, violated applicable fair hearing requirements, the state's
Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights, the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting
Act and constitutional due process principles;
While the Delegated Certification appears to be largely focused on benefiting
the Yuba River's salmon and steelhead, it does not analyze its potential to
actually damage those fish by increasing water temperatures and reducing
aquatic habitat at key times. YCWA analyzed this potential by assuming
that the State Board staff would exercise their sub-delegated authority to
require YCWA to comply with CDFW's recommendations in the FERC
process - on which the Delegated Certification (p. 17) relies - and the State
Board staff's proposed Bay-Delta water quality control plan amendments.
YCWA's analysis demonstrates that this projected implementation of the

100180407.1100180407.DOCX B/14/2020 7:59 AM

: EXHIBIT D

Delegated Certification would cause lower Yuba River water temperatures to
exceed important temperatures thresholds for salmon more often. For
example, as shown on the attachment Attachment P3, which consists of
figures from YCWA's analysis in Appendix B, implementation of CDFW'g
recommendations and the State Board staff's proposed Bay-Delta water
quality objectives would result in lower Yuba River water temperatures
exceeding upper optimal (UO) and upper tolerable (UT) thresholds for key
lifestages of listed spring-run Chinook salmon 14% to 35% more often and in
drier conditions when that listed species is particularly vulnerable. (See
Appendix B, p. 39, Figures WTS-1 and WTS-2.)1
The, Delegated Certification does not analyze its impacts on all beneficial uses
of the Yuba River's water or its potential to cause indirect effects on Yuba
County's many disadvantaged communities, and the county's previously
overdrafted groundwater basin. For example, the Delegated Certification
contains no indication that water-supply impacts were considered in
developing its terms, even though irrigated agriculture is Yuba County's
primary industry and has long relied upon Yuba River water. Yuba's
modeling of the Delegated Certification's potential implementation through
sub-delegated staff authority indicates that it could cause surface-water
shortages reaching 36% in dry years and 49% in critical years, which could
indirectly result in renewed overdraft of the county's groundwater and
dewatering of domestic wells, (Attachment B1, p. 17, Table 3.1; Appendix G.)
The absence of any consideration of such factors causes the Delegated
Certification to violate Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, the
fundamental policies of the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and
basic rules of California and federal administrative law;
The Delegated Certification exceeds the allowable scope of a water quality
certification because it seeks to require YCWA to addresa the impacts of
otherg' actions and facilities - including damage done to the Yuba River by
historic hydraulic mining and reductions in flows associated with exports

1On attachment P3, implementation of the Delegated Certification is represented as
"Projected Condition 1 (D)."

. EXHIBIT D

from the watershed by other diverters - by, among other things, moving fish
above the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Englebright Dam; and
The Delegated Certification's issuance violated CEQA because it was not
authorized by the recent amendment to Water Code section 13160, given that
the Delegated Certification cannot change the past facts on which FERC
found that waiver had occurred.
The problems with the Delegated Certification are perhaps best typified by the fact that it does not consider well-documented conditions affecting the Yuba River prior to the
YRDP's construction, including:
The continuing effects on the Yuba River and its habitat for fish resulting
from hydraulic mining, which discharged an estimated "684 million cubic
yards of gravel and debris . . . into the Yuba River system - more than triple
the volume of earth excavated during construction of the Panama Canal"
(Yoshiyama et al, "Historical and Present Distribution of Chinook Salmon in
the Central Valley Drainage of California" (2001) p. 122 (Attachment C16));
and
During the 1960s, prior to the YRDP's construction, CDFW sometimes would
build a physical barrier across the mouth of the Yuba River to prevent
galmon from migrating into the river until mid-October (Wooster & Wickwire,
"A Report On The Fish And Wildlife Resources Of The Yuba River To Be
Affected By The Marysville Dam And Reservoir And Marysville Afterbay And
Measures Proposed To Maintain These Resources (CDFG prelim. draft 1970)
p. 52 (Attachment C14)).
5. The manner in which the petitioner is aggrieved (Cal. Code Regs., title 23, § 3867, subd. (d)(5))
As explained in more detail in the materials submitted in support of this Petition,
and as the agency the Legislature specially created in 1959 to address the "water problems"
of Yuba County, YCWA is aggrieved by the Delegated Certification because it could, among
other things;
Allow the State Board's staff members - without holding any hearing - to
require YCWA to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to implement fish
passage above the federal Englebright Dam, which predated the YRDP by

(00180407.1100180407.DOCX •6• 8/14/2020 7:63 AM

EXHIBIT D

over 25 years and would continue to block fish passage if the YRDP were to
cease operating;
Allow the State Board's staff members - without holding any hearing - to
impose new streamflow requirements on YCWA that could significantly
reduce YCWA's hydroelectrie generation and agricultural water supplies,
including supplies that are used in areas that were in a state of significant
overdraft before YCWA's deliveries began;
Significantly impair, through approximately $500 million in lost revenues
and increased costs that do not include potentially hundreds of millions of
dollars more in potential fish-passage costs, YCWA's ability to support public
safety and other projects to benefit the people of Yuba County and their
disadvantaged communities (Appendix F); and
Adversely affect YCWA's implementation of measures to benefit the Yuba
River's salmon and steelhead by compelling YCWA to operate its facilities in
a manner that would, among other things, significantly reduce reservoir.
storage and consequently increase the river'g water temperatures at sensitive
times for those fish.

6. The specific action by the state board which the petitioner requests (Cal, Code Regs., title 23, § 3867, subd. (d)(6))
YCWA requests that the State Board grant reconsideration and immediately vacate
the Delegated Certification. If the State Board were to grant reconsideration and congider
modifying the Delegated Certification, then YCWA requests a formal hearing before the
State Board and objects to any informal hearing for that purpose. In any hearing, there
would need to be an appropriate separation of functions among the State Board's staff members, given that an unknown number of those staff members participated in preparing
the Delegated Certification. (See Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. State Water
Resources Control Bd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 731, 737-738 (investigative and advisory functions
must be separated within an individual matter).)
7. A list of persons, if any, other than the petitioner and
applicant, if not the petitioner, known to have an interest in the subject matter of the petition (Cal. Code Regs., title 23, § 3867, subd. (d)(7))

Water Network, The July 17, 2020 letter by which the Executive Director transmitted the
Delegated Certification to YCWA also states that the State Board has an "Interested
Parties Mailing List," but YCWA is not aware of who is on that list.
8. A statement that the petition has been sent to the appropriate regional board or executive officer and to the applicant, if not the petitioner (Cal. Code Regs., title 23, § 3867, subd. (d)(8))
Electronic copies of this Petition, and all materiale submitted with this Petition,
have been sent to the following:

Rancho Cordova, California 95670
There was no applicant for a water quality certification in this case. The Executive
Director denied without prejudice YCWA's prior application for a water quality certification
in a July 31, 2019 letter and YCWA has not filed a new application after that date.
9. A copy of a request to the executive director or appropriate executive officer for preparation of the state board or regional board staff record, if applicable and available, which will include a tape recording or transcript of any pertinent regional board or staff hearing (Cal, Code Regs., title 28, § 3867, subd. (d)(9))
A copy of the August 13, 2020 letter gent to the Executive Director requesting the
preparation of the administrative record is attached to this Petition as Attachment P2.
10. A summary of the manner in which and to what extent the
petitioner participated in any process (e.g., public hearing testimony, discussion with agency personnel, correspondence), if available, leading to the action or failure
to act in question (Cal. Code Regs., title 28, § 8867, subd. (d)(10))
YCWA is not aware of any open process leading to the Delegated Certification's
issuance: The Executive Director denied YCWA's prior application for a water quality
certification without prejudice in a July 31, 2019 letter and YCWA has not filed another
application. In a July 16, 2020 electronic meeting, the Executive Director orally informed
YCWA that she would be issuing the Delegated Certification the following day. That was
the first time that anyone affiliated with the State Board informed anyone affiliated with
YCWA that the Executive Director was considering issuing the Delegated Certification. To
the extent that the regulatory process before FERC for the YRDP's relicensing may be

considered a "process leading to the action in question," YCWA has participated
continuously in that process for years in its role ae the applicant.
Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, and in the Statement and additional materials
submitted with this Petition, Yuba County Water Agency respectfully requests that the
State Water Resources Control Board grant reconsideration of the Delegated Certification
and immediately vacate the Delegated Certification.
