27 alleges as follows:
28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1

INTRODUCTION
1

2 1. This Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate ("Petition") concerns the

3 approval of the "Strauss Wind Energy Project" (the "Project") proposed by Strauss Wind,

4 LLC ("Strauss") and BayWa r.e. Wind, LLC ("BayWa" and, collectively with Strauss, the

5 "Real Parties in Interest" or "RPI").
6 2. The Project is a commercial wind farm consisting of twenty-nine (29) wind
7 turbine generators ("WTG(s)"), associated infrastructure, and support facilities. The
8

9 Project's enormity cannot be overstated. As approved, the individual blades of the

10 WTG's will be 224.7 feet in length (¾ the length of a football field and ½ as wide) and

11 each WTG will reach up to 492 feet in height, blade inclusive.1

12 3. The location of the Project is somewhat amorphous. Although each WTG
13 will be located "along the ridges" of the Lompoc Valley, as currently approved, the exact
14 location of each proposed WTG is unknown.
15
4.
16 The Project will require a minimum of 950,237 cubic yards of earthen

17 material to be cut and 961,778 cubic yards of earthen material to be filled.2 It will also
18 require the construction of 8.2 miles of new roads and the expansion of miles of existing

19 roads (in order to allow for transport of the enormous blades, supporting equipment, and
20 machinery necessary for the construction of the Project).
21 5. On January 28, 2020, Respondent Santa Barbara County Board of
22 Supervisors certified the Project's Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR")
23

24 under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), finding that the Project was

25 adequate relative to CEQA. A notice of determination to carry out the Project was filed

26 Stated differently, most of these structures will be 50 stories tall, taller than any other building between
27 Los Angeles and San Jose (by a wide margin) and almost 200 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty (which stands at 305 feet tall).
28 For reference, a standard dump truck carries 10 cubic yards.

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

2

by Respondent on January 29, 2020.

2 6. Petitioners, other agencies, interest groups, and individuals made oral and

3 written comments on the inadequacies present in the SEIR and the findings contained

4 therein and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
DESCRIPTION OF PARTIES TO THE ACTION

6 7. Petitioners George and Cheryl Bedford, husband and wife, are and were,
at all times herein mentioned, citizens residing in Santa Barbara County, California.

9 8. The Bedfords reside in a home immediately adjacent to the Project site.

10 The Bedfords and members of the public routinely view the scenic nature and aesthetic

11 qualities of the project site, cross the site for recreational activities, enjoy the ecological,

12 cultural and spiritual resources on the Project site, and are personally and directly
13 affected by the Project. The Bedford's (and members of the public's) interests in
14 preservation of the environmental integrity of the Project site will be adversely affected
15

16 by the violations of CEQA, the approval of the Project, and certification of the SEIR in

17 the absence of CEQA compliance.

18 9. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara ("BOS")

19 is the highest governing authority of the County of Santa Barbara, exercising legislative
20 authority over County land use matters and controlling, through the Chairman of the
21 Board, the conduct of the Board of Supervisors' hearings generally, and specifically, the
22 hearings which led to the approval of the Project and SEIR.
23
10.
24 Respondent Santa Barbara County (the "County") is organized under the

25 laws and Constitution of the State of California. The County is empowered to, among

26 other duties, provide for the orderly planning and management of land use within its
27 • borders, including permitting of the Project, subject to the obligations and limitations of

28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

3

all applicable state, federal and other laws, including CEQA. The County is the lead

2 agency under CEQA. As used herein, "Respondent" refers collectively to both

3 Respondent BOS and Respondent County.

11. DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are officers, agents or employees of
Respondent, or other unknown persons, entities or agencies with an interest in the
subject matter of this dispute. The identities and capacities of such DOES are unknown
to Petitioners at this time. Petitioners will seek leave to amend this Petition to identify
the true name and capacity of each such person when identified.

10 12. Petitioners are informed and believe that Real Party in Interest Strauss is
11 the applicant for the Project and Real Party in Interest BayWa is a subsidiary and/or

12 affiliate of Strauss and also an applicant for the Project.

13 13. ROES 11 through 20, inclusive, are individuals, governmental agencies,
14 entities, corporations or other unknown persons that are Real Parties in Interest to this
15

16 dispute. The identities and capacities of such ROES are unknown to Petitioners at this

17 time. Petitioners will seek leave to amend this Petition to identify the true name and

18 capacity of each such person when identifled.

19 IlI. PROPRIETY OF VENUE

20 14. This action is filed in this county and this Court has jurisdiction over this
21

22 case because the property upon which the Project is proposed and forms the basis for

23 this Petition is located wholly within this jurisdiction, because the Bedfords and their

24 affected property are located wholly within this jurisdiction, and because all acts

25 complained of as perpetrated by the Respondents occurred in this jurisdiction and apply

26 to said property. This Court further has jurisdiction over the BOS and the County as
27 agencies established by the legislature of the State of California with principal places 01
28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

4

1 business in the County of Santa Barbara.

2 15. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of

3 ordinary law unless this Court grants this Petition and requires Respondent to set aside

4 its approval of the Project and SEIR. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's

5 approval will remain in effect in violation of state law.
6 IV. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
7

8 16. The site proposed for the Project is a largely undeveloped rural coastline,
9 unique to Southern California. Its local ecology, biological diversity, agricultural
10 resources and cultural history are unparalleled. The Project is located on a prominent

11 ridge overlooking the Lompoc Valley, visible to virtually the entire population of the City
12 of Lompoc. Petitioners are informed and believe that the Project will be visible from a
13

14 600 square mile radius.

15 17. A similar version of the Project was proposed in or around 2006. That
16 project was referred to as the Lompoc Wind Energy Project ("LWEP"), An EIR was

17 conducted for the LWEP project (the "LWEP EIR") on or about late 2007 and 2008.

18 18. The LWEP project was subsequently abandoned.
19 19. Rather than undertaking a new environmental impact report for the Project,
20 the RPI instead chose only to "supplement" the decades old LWEP EIR by drafting the
21

22 SEIR. Respondents approved this action (i.e. supplementing an outdated EIR rathen

23 than drafting a new EIR specific to this Project) over objections raised by Petitioners and

24 others.

25 20. The SEIR - as well as an associated variance and a Conditional Use Permit

26 was approved by the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission on November 20.
27 2019. At that time, the Petitioners and others gave notice to Respondents and the Real
28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Parties in Interest that approval of the Project and the SEIR were inconsistent with

2 CEQA.

3 21. Petitioners and others timely appealed the Planning Commission's

4 approval to Respondent BOS, Within said appeal, the Petitioners again gave notice to

5 Respondent and the Real Party in Interest that the SEIR was inconsistent with CEQA.
6 22. On January 28, 2020, Respondent BOS conducted a public hearing on
Petitioner's appeal, considered testimony, evidence, and argument presented by
8
Petitioner and others, and approved both the Project and the SEIR.

10 23. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

11 §21267.5 in serving notice of this action on Respondents on February 11, 2020, A true

12 and correct copy of said notice and proof of service thereof is attached hereto and
13 incorporated herein by this reference as Exhibit A.
14 24. Petitioner will provide written notice to the California Attorney General of
15

16 the filing this Petition and will furnish him a copy of the same pursuant to Pub, Res. Code

17 §21167.7, and the California Code of Civil Procedure §388 concurrently with the filing of

18 this Petition. A true and correct copy of said notice is attached hereto and incorporated
19 herein by this reference as Exhibit B.

20 25. Petitioner has further complied with Pub. Res. Code §21167.6(a) by
21 serving a written request to Respondent to prepare the administrative record. A true and
22 correct copy of said request is attached hereto and incorporated herein by this record as
23

24 Exhibit C.

25 26. Petitioner and others, by and through their representatives, have
26 performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by raising each and every

27 issue known to them before Respondent BOS in compliance with Public Resources

28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

6

1 Code §21177.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT VIOLATIONS
(Cal. Public Resources Code §21000, et seq.)
4
27. The Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference all allegations

6 contained in paragraphs 1 to 26, inclusive, if as if set forth in full herein.

7 28. Respondent's actions in approving the Project and certifying the SEIR

8 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the
9 manner required by law and its decision is not supported by substantial evidence in
10 each of the following three (3) ways:
11 The SEIR was Approved Contrary to CEQA in that it Contained an Incomplete, 12 Insufficient, and Misleading Project Description, All of Which Undermined the
13 Adequacy of SEIR's Analysis of Environmental Impacts.

14 29. A complete and stable project description is required under CEQA (see,
15 among others, 14 Cal. Code Regs ("CCR") §15124(a)): "the precise location and
16 boundaries of the proposed project shall be shown on a detailed map, preferably
17 topographic"). Likewise, 14 CCR §15124 requires all projects to include a "description
18 of the project's technical, economic, and environmental characteristics."
19
30,
20 Notwithstanding the above law, the SEIR makes clear that each individual

21 WTGs can be "micro-sited" (or, as also used in the SEIR, "shifted") anywhere within a

22 100-foot radius of its "currently proposed" location.

23 31. As is apparent from the topographic maps presented in the SEIR, the

24 Project site is located on a hillside with rapid elevation changes from approximately
25 1,000 feet to 1,900 feet.
26
32. A 100-foot "shift" in some of the "currently proposed" WTG locations could
27

28 cause an elevation increase of up to 50 feet (depending on the "proposed location" of

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

7

1 each WTG and its eventual placement within the 100-foot radius), all of which could

2 cause significant impacts not set forth or contemplated in the SEIR.

3 33. Respondent's failure to identify the precise location for each WTG is
4 fundamentally insufficient under CEQA in that it creates objective uncertainty related it to

5 the Project's actual environmental impacts. For example, a potential height increase of

6 5 stories makes the aesthetic and visual resource analysis presented in the SEIR not
7 only imprecise, but potentially misleading. Likewise, such a "shift" makes the SEIR's
8

9 analysis of other environmental impacts (e.g. avian strike impacts, noise impacts, and
10 biological resource impacts such as the potential necessity of removing oak trees and

11 other native species) indefinite and potentially misleading as well.

12 34. The precise location of each WTG was, and is, fundamentally necessary to

13 determine the actual environmental impacts associated with the Project and comply with
14 CEQA.
15
35.
16 Respondent's approval of both the Project and the SEIR without requiring

17 the locations of each WTG to be stable and finite was, and is, legally impermissible

18 under CEQA.

19 B. The EIR Was Approved Contrary to CEQA In That It Deferred Both

20 Environmental Assessment And Potentially Necessary Mitigation.

21 36. The requirement that an applicant adopt mitigation measures which may

22 be implemented as a result of a "future study" is in direct conflict with the guidelines
23 implementing CEQA because this approach masks potential impacts of the actually
24| approved project. See, among others, 14 CCR §15126.4(a)(1)(B) ("Formulation of
25 mitigation measures should not be deferred until some future time.").
26

27

28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

8

37. The SEIR defers both adequate environmental assessment and potentially

2 necessary environmental mitigation, as evidenced by multiple sections of the SEIR
3 including, but not limited to, MM BIO-5, MM BIO 6, and MM BIO-11.a.

38. By deferring these assessments and potentially necessary mitigation

5 measures until after SEIR certification, environmental review of this project has been

6 severely hampered and the basic principles and functions of CEQA have been violated.
7 C. The EIR Was Approved Contrary to CEQA In That It Contained an Inadequate Analysis of Project Alternatives.
9 39. Public Resources Code §21002 establishes the legislative intent that
10 CEQA take into account less environmentally onerous alternatives to a project when
11

12 such alternatives are available ("public agencies should not approve projects as

13 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available

14 which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects").

15 Section 15126.6(a) of the CEQA Guidelines states that every Environmental Impact
16 Report "shall describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the
17 location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the
18 project, but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the
19

20 project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives."

21 40. Even as to alternatives that are rejected, EIRs must explain why each

22 suggested alternative either does not satisfy the goals of the proposed project, does not

23 offer substantial environmental advantages, or cannot be accomplished. If various

24 alternatives were considered and found infeasible, those alternatives and the reasons
25 they were rejected must be discussed in the EIR in sufficient detail to enable public
26

27 participation and criticism as well. Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of

28

PETITIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

9

1 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 405 (as modified on denial of reh'g (Jan.

2 26, 1989)).

3 41. The SEIR listed nine alternatives to the Project. Five of those nine

4 alternatives were dropped from further review and four of those alternatives were

5 carried forward for adequate analysis.

42. One of the alternatives dropped from further review was the alternative

that, as was established by substantial evidence, was likely to be the least
8

9 environmentally intrusive: to wit, reducing and/or eliminating the environmental impacts

10 associated with aesthetic/visibility and avian strikes (among other impacts) of the WTGs

11 by locating them away from ridgelines.

12 43. The SEIR specifically rejected adequate analysis of this alternative in four

13 unsupported paragraphs buried in the back of the 3,571-page document. Rather than
14 undertaking adequate analysis as to the reasons this alternative was rejected as
15

16 required by CEQA, the SEIR dismissed this alternative in a few brief and wholly

17 unsupported sentences (e.g. "The earth movement required to locate the WTGs away

18 from ridgelines would be significant [a conclusion that itself is undermined by other

19 sections of the SEIR] and "the loss of WTG generating capacity is expected to be
20 substantial").
21 44. Such analysis is legally insufficient under CEQA.
22 45. Because substantial evidence supports the position that this alternative
23

24 (i.e. placement of the WTGs below the ridgelines) would substantially lessen the

25 Project's environmental impacts due to, among other things, the reduction and/or

26 elimination of both aesthetic impacts and impacts to birds and bats, this alternative

27 should have been carried forward for full and adequate analysis in the SEIR and, in the

28

PETTTIONER'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

10

1 event that this alternative was ultimately found to be infeasible, a fact-based (non-

2 conclusory) explanation of this purported infeasibility should have been provided, all of
3  which ís required under CEQA.

4

5 46. Each of the three foregoing acts constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion|
6 by Respondent and a violation of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondent
7 violated its duty by approving the Project and certifying the SEIR in contravention of
8

9 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Accordingly, approval of the Project and certification

10 of the SEIR must be set aside.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:

14 A. For a peremptory writ of mandate to be issued under the seal of this Court
15 directing:
16

17 (a) Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of the SEIR;

18

19 (b) Respondent and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity on the Project

20 that could result in any change or alteration of the physical environment until
Respondent has taken actions that may be necessary to bring the SEIR into
21 compliance with CEQA.
22

23 (c) Respondent to prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate

24 SEIR and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to

25 approve the Project.
