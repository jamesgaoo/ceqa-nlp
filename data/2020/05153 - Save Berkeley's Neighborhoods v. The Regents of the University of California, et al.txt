Plaintiff Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods alleges:

2 On or about May 16, 2019, Respondent Regents of the University of California approved the Upper
3 Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020
4 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) (Project) and certified a Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Report (FSEIR) for the Project.
2. This action challenges Respondents' approval of the Project on grounds the approval violates the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
3.
8 Education Code section 67504 provides that "The Legislature further finds and declares that the

9 expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment.

10 Consistent with the requirements of the-California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of

11 the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant off-campus impacts related
to campus growth and development."
12 4. Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (b) requires that "Environmental effects
13 relating to changes in enrollment levels shall be considered for each campus or medical center of public
14 higher education in the environmental impact report prepared for the long range development plan for the
15 campus or medical center." Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (d) requires that
16 Respondents and the University of California, Berkeley "consider the environmental impact of academic)
17 and enrollment plans" pursuant to CEQA and "that any such plans shall become effective for a campus ...
18 only after the environmental effects of those plans have been analyzed" as required by CEQA.

18 17 Statute of Limitations
Respondents filed a Notice of Determination for the Project with the Governor's Office of Planning
19 and Research on May 17, 2019. Plaintiff filed its original Petition For Writ of Mandate on June 13, 2019,

20

21 within the thirty (30) day limitations period provided in subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section
21167(c).

22 18.

23 Respondents' May 17, 2019, Notice of Determination for the Project as filed with the Governor's

24 Office of Planning and Research is substantively deficient because it fails to describe a critical component

25 of the project; namely: the substantial increase in enrollment occurring since Respondents adopted a 2020
Long Range Development Plan in 2005 and expected future increases in enrollment, in violation of the

26 CEQA Guidelines, at Title 14, Cal. Code Regs. § 15094(b)(2). Therefore, Respondents' May 17, 2019,

27 Notice of Determination did not commence the thirty (30) day limitations period provided in subdivision

28 (c) of Public Resources Code section 21167(c). (See e.g., Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163

- (1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 265, 273.) This amended petition is, therefore, filed within the 180-day limitations
2 period provided in the CEQA Guidelines, at Title 14, Cal. Code Regs. § 15112(c)(5); or alternatively, the
3 three-year limitations period for statutory causes of action provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
4 338(a).

5 Notice Requirements

6 19. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Plaintiff served Respondents with

13 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5; and as a complaint for declaratory
14 relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has jurisdiction over these claims.
15 22. Venue is proper in Alameda County under Code of Civil Procedure section 394, subdivision (a),
16 because UC and Respondents are situated therein.
17 Standing
18 23. Plaintiff and, to the extent applicable, its members are beneficially interested in Respondents' full
19 compliance with CEQA. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA with respect to the

21 duties that CEQA imposes on Respondents.

22 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

23 24. Respondents' approval of the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal

24 procedures.
25.
25 In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Plaintiff objected to

26 Respondents' approval of the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to the

27 close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of any Project related Notice of Determination.

9 ensuring that Respondents complete adequate environmental review of the Project's environmental effects.
30.
10 Issuance of the relief requested herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the

11 public interest. By compelling Respondents to complete adequate environmental review of the Project's

12 environmental effects, Plaintiff will vindicate the public's important CEQA rights to public disclosure
regarding and public participation in government decisions that affect the environment.
13 31. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's fees
14 appropriate in this proceeding because the transgressor is the agency whose duty it is to enforce the laws at
15 issue in this proceeding,

1 37. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's environmental effects caused by increases in student
2 enrollment at the UC Berkeley campus since 2005.

3 a. As explained in the Southside Neighborhood Consortjum's April 12, 2019, comment letter,

4 p. 1: . :

10:0 "The Project description is uncertain because while the NOP [Notice of Preparation] directly. asserts the increase in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected in 2005 is part ofthe "project," the Draft SEIR equivocates on this commitment. Instead, the Draft SEIR has
7 artfully included the increase in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected in

8 2005 in the "baseline" or "environmental setting" rather than in the "project description." As a result, the reader is left guessing as to whether the Draft SEIR actually evaluates the
9 environmental impacts of increases in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected

10 in 2005."
b.
11 As explained in the City of Berkeley's May 13, 2019, comment letter, p. 1:
"one of the 'thematic responses' provided in the FSEIR asserts that the document's analysis 12 of increased enrollment is not part of the 'project' being analyzed, but rather just an "updated
13 baseline.' As discussed below, this discussion is not responsive.to the concerns raised in the
14 City's comments on the draft SEIR, as it fails to point to any specific instance in which the SEIR uses this 'updated baseline' in analyzing the impacts of the GSPP Project, and it 15 continues to refer to the SEIR's analysis of impacts caused by this increased enrollment. 16 Under CEQA, a lead agency only analyzes project impacts. A baseline by definition has no
impacts."
17 C. 18 The SEIR fails to acknowledge that the Project would substantially increase the local
population and exacerbate inadequate housing conditions for university students and for City of
19 Berkeley residents or to lawfully assess the environmental effects of these changes. (See e.g., April
20 12, 2019, Southside Neighborhood Consortium comment letter pp. 9-10; April 12, 2019, City of
21 Berkeley comment letter, p. 9; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 6-10.)

22 d. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the effects of Project's increases in student enrollment on

23 community aesthetics, including increases in street trash and littering. (See e.g., April 12, 2019,

24 Southside Neighborhood Consortium comment letter, pp. 7-8; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley

25 comment letter, p. 9; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 6-10.)

26 e. The SEIR fails to acknowledge that the Project's increased enrollment will result in a

27 substantial increase in service population that will significantly impact public services and

28 infrastructure or to lawfully assess the environmental effects of these changes. (See e.g., April 12,
2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p. 11; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. Law Offlcas c

•Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No. RG19022887

1 10-15.)
2 38. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on historic and cultural resources. The SEIR
3 fails to adequately describe existing conditions at the project site, including the historically significant
4 character of the area surrounding the Project site; the SEIR provides an incomplete analysis of impacts to

5 identified historic resources; the SEIR defers mitigation of significant impacts to identified historic

6 resources; the SEIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate impacts relating to archaeological resources; and

7 the SEIR fails to analyze alternative building designs that avoid significant impacts on historic and cultural

8 resources. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter , pp. 30-34; May 13, 2019, comment
letter from the City of Berkeley, pp. 21-25; March 7, 2019, City of Berkeley Landmarks Preservation

11 39:
12 The SEIR fails to adequately describe the Project. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley
comment letter, p. 6; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 3-5.)
13 40. The SEIR unlawfully tiers to the 2020 LRDP EIR. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley
14 comment letter, p. 7; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p. 5.)
15 41. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on traffic and transportation. (See e.g., April
16 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p. 17; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 15-
17 18.)
18 42. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on air quality. (See c.g., April 12, 2019, City
19 of Berkeley comment letter, p. 19-23; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 18-19.)

20 43. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions and

21 climate change. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 23-26; May 13, 2019, City

22 of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 18-19.)

23 44. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on noise pollution. (See e.g., April

24 12, 2019, Southside Neighborhood Consortium comment letter, pp. 8-9; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley

25 comment letter, p. 26; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 19-20.)
45.
26 The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's land use effects and inconsistencies with

27 the City's General Plan and zoning laws. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 27-
29; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 26-27).

8 range of reasonable alternatives. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, Southside Neighborhood Consortium commenti

12 Second Cause of Action
13 (Promissory estoppel)
14 51. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs of this petition as though set

15 forth herein in full.

16 52. a Plaintiff filed a previous action, entitled Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods v The Regents of the

17 University of California, et al., Alameda Superior Court Case No. RG18902751 ("SBN v Regents P'). In

18 SBN v Regents I, Plaintiff alleges that in 2005, the Regents adopted a 2020 Long Range Development Plan

19 ("LRDP") for the UC Berkeley campus to achieve objectives through the year 2020, including stabilizing

20 enrollment and that the Regents prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report the LRDP ("2005

21 EIR"). Plaintiff also alleges in SBN v Regents I that the LRDP and 2005 EIR projected that by 2020 student

22* enrollment at UCB would increase by 1,650 students and that the 2005 EIR evaluated the environmental
impact of this enrollment increase. Plaintiff also alleges in SBN v Regents I that by 2018, actual enrollment
23 had increased five times more than the 1,650 students projected in the LRDP and 2005 EIR.
24 53. Plaintiff also alleges in SBN v Regents I that CEQA requires that the Regents conduct subsequent
25 environmental review of its decisions to increase student enrollment at UC Berkeley over the 1,650 student
26 increase projected in the LRDP because such increases are "substantial," meaning the unanalyzed increases
27 may have new or more severe significant environmental effects. (See, Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa,
28 Inc. V. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 934, 936-937 (Concerned Citizens); CEQA §

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No. RG19022887

21068 ["[s]ignificant effect on the environment" means "a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse
2 change in the environment"].)
3 54. an The primary prayer for relief in SBN v Regents I is for order compelling the Regents "to subject
4 the excess increase in student enrollment to the procedures and requirements of CEQA ... including, without
limitation, by preparing and certifying an Environmental Impact Report to assess the significance of impacts

6 caused by the excess increase in student enrollment, and to make the findings required by Public Resources
Code section 21081."

55.
8 Respondents made a promise to Plaintiff, as set forth in the next paragraph, that the SEIR challenged

9 in this action would and did include the post-LRDP increases in enrollment above the 1,650 student increase

10 projected in the LRDP in the "project description" as required by CEQA, and an evaluation of the
environmental impacts of these increases in enrollment.
11 56. Respondents made this promise repeatedly, including, without limitation, in the following
12 documents:
13 a. The Notice of Preparation for the SEIR states:
14 The need for a Supplemental EIR is primarily triggered by two issues: (1) changes to the
15 2020 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) land use plan to accommodate the proposed
16 project; and (2) an increase in current and foreseeable campus population levels above those

17 analyzed in the LRDP EIR, based on a general increase in student enrollment and employee
levels and growing the GSPP program(s). The Draft Supplemental EIR will analyze whether
18 these issues would result in new or substantially more severe significant impacts than

19 identified in the LRDP EIR.

20 b. The SEIR states:

21 Because the LRDP Final EIR estimated campus headcount only through 2020 and because
the campus headcount projected for 2020 has already been exceeded, the information in the
22 LRDP Final EIR has become outdated.... The environmental analysis of each impact
23 category in Section 6 of this SEIR takes into account the updated campus headcount baseline

24 and explains how the increased campus headcount factors into and/or affects the
environmental analysis and significance conclusions reached in the LRDP Final EIR and this
•25 SEIR.

26 C. Consistent with this statement, every chapter of Section 6 of the SEIR treated the "updated
27 campus headcount" as a component of the project description by discussing, as the Notice of

28 it Preparation said it would, the environmental effects of post-LRDP enrollment increases.

Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No. RG19022887

d. Respondents issued CEQA "findings" for the Project regarding the significance of

2 environmental impacts associated with post-LRDP enrollment increases.

3 e. In their demurrer papers in SBN v Regents I, Respondents represented to the Superior Court
and Plaintiff that the SEIR provides the CEQA evaluation of post-LRDP enrollment increases sought
by Plaintiff in SBN v Regents
: f. In their Respondents Brief on appeal in SBN v Regents I, Respondents represented to the
Court of Appeal and Plaintiff that the SEIR provides the CEQA analysis of post-LRDP enrollment
increases sought by Plaintiff in SBN v Regents I.
Based on the Notice of Preparation of the SEIR, Plaintiff understood immediately that the SEIR
might moot Plaintiff's legal claims in SBN v Regents I. 10 O 58. Plaintiff also understood that in order to preserve its legal right to ensure that the Regents comply| 11
tH with CEQA in their evaluation of the post-LRDP increases in enrollment above the 1,650 student increase
12 projected in the LRDP, Plaintiff would need to submit comments on the SEIR's environmental evaluation
13 of these increases in enrollment, and potentially file a CEQA action challenging the SEIR's environmental
14 evaluation of these increases in enrollment.
15 59. Each of the additional documents described above confirmed this understanding.
16 60. Plaintiff and Respondents are adverse parties in SBN v. Regents I and in this action.
.17 61. Respondents' promises (i.e., Respondents prior position in SBN v. Regents I) induced Plaintiff to
18 take many actions and Plaintiff reasonably and detrimentally relied on these promises by taking many
19 actions, including, without limitation:

20 a. Plaintiff carefully reviewed the Draft and Final SEIR.:

21 b. Plaintiff submitted public comments on the SEIR.

22 C. Plaintiff retained legal counsel and coordinated the filing and prosecution of this action

23 challenging the legal adequacy of the EIR.
& 62. Plaintiff took these actions because if it had not, Plaintiff faced an intolerable risk that the SEIR
would be certified and not challenged in litigation, and once final, would moot Plaintiff's prayer for relief 25
26 in SBN v. Regents I. In that event, Plaintiff would be left with no legal remedy to require Respondents to
conduct environmental review pursuant to CEQA of the post-LRDP increases in enrollment above the 1,650
27 student increase projected in the LRDP or to challenge the legal adequacy-in this action- of the SEIR's
28 environmental review of these enrollment increases.

63. Respondents should reasonably have expected their promises to induce Plaintiff to take the action
2 described in the previous paragraph.
3 64. In this action, Respondents assert that the SEIR challenged in this action does not include, as part
of the project description and as required by CEQA, an evaluation of the environmental impacts of the
5 increases in student enrollment above the 1,650 student increase projected in the LRDP, which is contrary

6 to their position stated in SBN v Regents I.

7 65. Plaintiff would now be prejudiced if the court were to permit Réspondents to change their position

8 because such change may cause Plaintiff to lose the benefit of its investment in this action.
66.
9 Injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of Respondents' promise.
67.
10 Consequently, Respondents are estopped from contending in this action that the post-LRDP increases VA..

11 in enrollment above the 1,650 student increase projected in the LRDP are not part of the SEIR's project

12 description or that the SEIR's evaluation of these increases in student enrollment is not subject to judicial

17 69. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs of this petition as though set
18 forth herein in full.
19  70. Respondents have asserted inconsistent positions in SBN v. Regents I and this action.

20 71. Plaintiff and Respondents are adverse parties in SBN v. Regents I and in this action:
21 72. In SBN v. Regents I, Respondents asserted that the SEIR challenged in this action would and did

22 include the post-LRDP increases in enrollment above the 1,650 student increase projected in the LRDP in

23 the "project description" as required by CEQA, and an evaluation of the environmental impacts of these

24 increases in enrollment, as described in paragraph 56 above.
73.
25 Plaintiff reasonably and detrimentally relied on Respondents prior position in SBN v. Regents I by

26 taking many actions, including, without limitation:

a.
27 Plaintiff carefully reviewed the Draft and Final SEIR.
b. Plaintiff submitted public comments on the SEIR.
28 C. Plaintiff retained legal counsel and coordinated the filing and prosecution of this action

challenging the legal adequacy of the EIR.
2 74. Plaintiff took these actions because if it had not, Plaintiff faced an intolerable risk that the SEIR
3 would be certified and not challenged in litigation, and once final, would moot Plaintiff's prayer for reliefl
4 in SBN v. Regents I. In that event, SBN would be left with no legal remedy to require Respondents to
5 conduct environmental review pursuant to CEQA of the post-LRDP increases in enrollment above the 1,650

6 student increase projected in the LRDP or to challenge the legal adequacy-in this action- of the SEIR's

7 environmental review of these enrollment increases.

8 75. In this action, Respondents assert that the SEIR challenged in this action does not include, as part

10 increases in student enrollment above the 1,650 student increase projected in the LRDP, which is contrary
to their position stated in SBN v Regents I.
11 76.
12 Plaintiff would now be prejudiced if the court were to permit Respondents to change their position

13 because such change may cause Plaintiff to lose the benefit of its investment in this action.
77. Consequently, Respondents are estopped from contending in this action that the post-LRDP increases
14 in enrollment above the 1,650 student increase projected in the LRDP are not part of the SEIR's project
15 description or that the SEIR's evaluation of these increases in student enrollment is not subject to judicial
16 review by the court in this action. (Jackson v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 183.)
17/ 78. Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will suffer
18 irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested herein.

19 Prayer for Relief

20 WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for the following relief:

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Upper Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report.
Dear Chancellor Christ and Regents of the University of California:

This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that on or
before June 13, 2019, Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods (Petitioner) intends to file a lawsuit challenging the University's adoption of the Upper Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) (Project) and certification of a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (FSEIR) for the Project. The action will challenge The Regents' approval of the Project on grounds the approval violates the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Petitioner is interested in discussing settlement of this dispute without the need for litigation. Toward that end, Petitioner proposes that the University meet with Petitioner as soon as possible to discuss their concerns regarding the Upper Hearst project and to explore possible resolutions that might obviate the need for Petitioner to proceed with filing the above-described action. Petitioner also proposes that the University agree to toll CEQA's limitations period to provide an opportunity for pre-litigation settlement discussions.
I have calendared June 17, 2019, as the last day to file the action consistent with CEQA's

Chancellor Carol T. Christ, University of California, Berkeley

statute of limitations. However, I will be unavailable June 14 through 18. Therefore, unless the Regents agree to toll the limitations period to discuss settlement, Petitioner intends to file the
action on June 13, 2019.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours,
