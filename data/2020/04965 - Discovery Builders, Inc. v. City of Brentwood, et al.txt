INTRODUCTION EL OY 42s Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), allege as follows: San Francisco, CA 94102 (collectively "Petitioners"), by this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for

1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the decision by the City of Brentwood and Suite 200 26| its City Council (collectively "City") to approve a development application for the Amber Lane
27 Apartments Project ("Project"). Specifically, Petitioners allege that the City's actions in

38349\13076929.6 - 28 approving the Project violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and its

1 implementing Guidelines because the City failed to undertake any project-specific CEQA review

2 of the Project. Rather than undertake the required CEQA review, the City adopted the
3 unsupported position that the Project is "exempt" under Section 15183 of the CEQA Guidelines

4 because the Project supposedly would be consistent with the general land use designation of the
5 PA-1 Specific Plan Area for which the City previously prepared a program Environmental Impact
6 Report. However, the City has made a fundamental error. This program level EIR specifically

7 contemplated that particular projects within the specific plan area would require project-specific
8 CEQA review. Indeed, such CEQA review was mandatory here because even the cursory Project
9 environmental information developed by the City demonstrated that the Project potentially could
10 or would have a wide range of significant project- and site-specific environmental effects.
11 2. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
12 required by CEQA by its improper decision not to conduct any formal CEQA review of the
13 Amber Lane Apartments Project prior to its approval. This decision could have far-reaching
14 adverse environmental impacts on adjacent developments, such as Petitioners' Bridle Gate
15 Project. When Petitioners commented on the lack of project- and site-specific details in the EIR

16 for the PA-1 Specific Plan Area, the City indicated (and the EIR provided) that such impacts
17 would be robustly evaluated under CEQA when specific projects were proposed. However, now
18 that a specific project has been proposed, the City flip-flops and asserts that all such impacts are
19 already encompassed within the program level EIR analysis for this Arca. This approach
20 essentially means that the Project has illegally evaded any project specific CEQA review. To
21 make matters worse, the City has illegally deferred evaluation and identification of mitigation for
22 these environmental impacts.

23 3. The City's design review approval itsclf also violated governing law. Contrary to
24 the requirements of the City's Municipal Code, the City did not receive detailed design plans for
25 key design components of the Project, including landscape plans for strect frontage landscape
26 areas and exterior lighting. Moreover, one critical portion of the design review analysis under the
27 Municipal Code is that "[t]he proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects
28 on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or

traffic." Although the approving resolution generally states without any support that this criterion
2  has been met, no substantial evidence supports this finding. The City attempted at the last minute
3 to address this important deficiency with conditions of approval requiring the applicant to submit

4 further information at a later time. However, the City committed reversible errors by not
5 obtaining the necessary information and not making supported factual findings before making the
6 Project approval decision, Accordingly, the City's approval was in error and must be vacated.

STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

2 14. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in the City's full and
3 complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in granting discretionary

4 approvals for the Project.

5 15. The City owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authority

6 under CEQA before exercising its discretion to approve the Project.

7 16. Petitioners have developed and are planning to develop multiple properties within

8 the City. One such development is the Bridle Gate Project, which is a residential development

9 project that is located immediately south and southwest of the Priority Area 1 Specific Plan Area
10 ("SP Area") within which the Amber Lane Apartments Project would be located. Petitioners have
11 an important interest in ensuring that all of the environmental impacts of the Project are identified

12 and fully mitigated, including environmental impacts that may or could affect Petitioners' nearby
13 development projects.

14 17. Petitioners took an active role in providing written comments on the program level
15 Environmental Impact Report for the PA-1 Specific Plan Area within which the Project would be

16 sited, due to Petitioners' concerns about the potential environmental effects of projects within this
17 Area 011 their nearby development projects.

18 18. Petitioners filed written comments objecting to approval of the Project at the
19 public hearings held by the Brentwood Planning Commission, and Petitioners filed written
20 comments and provided oral testimony opposing approval of the Project on appeal to the City
21 Council, as further alleged herein.

22 19. Petitioners also have public interest standing to enforce the laws violated by the
23 City, including CEQA.

24 20. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
25 and will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this Petition.

26 NOTICE OF LAWSUIT

27 21. On February 25, 2020, Petitioners sent by mail, overnight delivery and email a

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
10 Amber Lane Apartments Project Approval Process

11 24. On August 8, 2019, Real Party in Interest Tekin & Associates, LLC submitted an
12 application with the City of Brentwood, requesting approval of a design review application (DR
13 No. 19-010) for the development of a 288-unit apartment complex and community center on three
14 adjacent parcels of undeveloped land within the PA-1 Specific Plan Area.

15 25. On September 6, 2019, the City informed Tekin that the application was
16 incomplete and that additional information was required. Following Tekin's resubmittal on
17 October 4, 2019, the Project was once again deemed incomplete in an October 10, 2019 letter
18 from the City.

19 26. The Project application was eventually deemed complete and was scheduled for a
20 public hearing on the agenda of the Brentwood Planning Commission meeting on December 3,
21 2019. On December 3, 2019, Petitioner Discovery, through its attorneys, submitted a letter to the
22 Planning Commission objecting to approval of the Project, identifying a number of inadequacies
23 in the Planning Commission's review, including the omission of any provisions relating to
24  impacts on fire and emergency services and the lack of project-specific CEQA review.

25 27. At this Planning Commission meeting, the City Planning Manager informed the
26 Planning Commission that Discovery's letter raised issues requiring staff review and requested
27 that the matter be continued.

28 28. The Project was rescheduled for consideration at the Planning Commission

205 Montgomery Suect, 17* Floor San Francisco, Coliforuia 94101 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
(415) 954-4400

meeting set on December 17, 2019. Petitioner Discovery, through its attorneys, submitted a letter
2 dated December 17, 2019 to the Planning Commission in which it opposed the Project approval

3 because of inadequacies in the City's CEQA analysis and design review. Nevertheless, the

4 Brentwood Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 19-038 approving the Project by a 3-1

5 vote at the December 17, 2019 meeting.

6 29. On December 20, 2019, Petitioner Discovery timely filed a written appeal to the
7 Brentwood City Council of the Planning Commission's decision approving the Project. In this
8 appeal, Discovery challenged both the Planning Commission's inadequate CEQA review and its
9 improper design review approval decision.

10 30. The City scheduled a public hearing of the appeal of the Planning Commission's

11 approval of the Project before the City Council for its January 28, 2020 meeting. Pursuant to the
12 Brentwood Municipal Code, the City Council was required to perform a de novo review of the
13 Planning Commission's decision. Municipal Code § 17.880.030(E).

14 31. On or about January 24, 2020, City Staff posted the agenda packet for the Project
15 appeal, which included a short staff response to the appeal a and a new document purporting to be
16 an "environmental analysis" for the Project. This environmental analysis, which was not dated,
17 appears to have been produced after the Planning Commission decision, in response to the filing
18 of Discovery's appeal.

19 32. Before the City Council meeting, Petitioners, through their attorneys, submitted to
20 the City a detailed comment letter dated January 28, 2020 in which they opposed approval of the
21 Project, both because the CEQA review is inadequate and the design review approval is improper.
22 A true and correct copy of this letter is enclosed herewith as Exhibit "2" and incorporated herein
23 by reference. A representative of Petitioners and Petitioners' counsel also appeared and testified
24 at this City Council hearing in opposition to approval of the Project.
25 33. At its mecting on January 28, 2020, the City Council held a public hearing on
26 Petitioner Discovery's appeal of the Planning Commission decision on the Project development
27 approval. The City Council denied the appcal filed by Discovery and approved the application
28 for the Project by way of Resolution No. 2020-13. In this Resolution, the City affirmed its view
7 - 38349\13076929.6 Farella Bramn 735 Montgamery Suee, 17ª Floor Sau Francisco, Califoraia 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (413) 954-H00

1 that"[n]o further environmental review is required at this time."

34. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the City has not
filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project approval under CEQA Guidelines Section 15062.

4 Priority Area 1 Specific Plan EIR

35. The City prepared an Environmental Impact Report for an approximately 431-acre
6 area within the City known as the Priority 1 Area Specific Plan ("PA-1 Specific Plan") Area.
This Area will accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population of
8 4,569 persons and almost four million square feet of commercial space.

9 36. The Environmental Impact Report for the PA-1 Specific Plan Area ("PA-1 EIR")
10 specifically acknowledges that it is a "program EIR." The PA-1 EIR acknowledges the
11 limitations on its future use under CEQA and specifically calls for project-specific environmental
12 analysis when particular developments within the PA-1 Specific Plan Area are proposed. Thus,
13 for example, a typical statement regarding particular environmental impacts in this EIR is: "based

14 upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed site-specific information
15 on this impact is not feasible." Draft EIR, p. 3.9-16. With regard to issues such as geology and
16 soils, the EIR specifically states that certain impacts "tend to be site-specific and project-
17 specific." Draft EIR, p. 4.0-10. Furthermore, public comments submitted on the Draft EIR
18 expressed concerns regarding the City's environmental analysis, including with regard to
19 Ipotentially significant impacts relating to traffic and abandoned oil and gas wells and facilities.
20 Final EIR, pp. 2.0-3 to 2.0-18.

21 37. Accordingly, the PA-1 EIR specifically contemplates that, to satisfy CEQA,
22 further project and site-specific CEQA review would need to occur for particular projects that
23 would be proposed for the PA-1 Specific Plan Area.

24 38. On November 13, 2018, the City Council certified the Final PA-1 EIR and
25 approved other gencral plan, specific plan, and zoning amendments related to the PA-1 Specific
26 Plan.

27| California Environmental Quality Act Requirements

28 39. CEQA requires a government agency considering a discretionary approval for a
• 8 - 38349\13076929.6 Farella Bamn Montel LLP 235 Monigomen Streel, 17° Flcor an F'rancisco, California 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
(415) 934-4400

1 development project to conduct environmental review of the project pursuant to CEQA's

2 provisions.

3 40. CEQA recognizes the concept of "tiering" of environmental review, although it
4 prescribes specific requirements that must be met to perform this type of sequential environmental

5 review. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "[t]iering is properly used to defer

6 analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases when the impacts or
mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval decision but are specific to the
later phases." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova,
9 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007).

10 41. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 provides the requirements for environmental
11 review of specific projects undertaken pursuant to a program EIR. Since the PA-1 EIR is a
12| "program" EIR, the requirements of Section 15168 directly apply.
13 42. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c) provides that "[l]ater activities in the program
14 must be examined in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional
15 environmental document must be prepared." Specifically, "[i]f a later activity would have effects
16 that were not examined in the ogram EIR, a new initial study would need to be prepared
17 leading to either an EIR or a negative declaration." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(c)(1) (emphasis
18 added). Here, numerous individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Project were not

19 examined in the PA-I EIR and therefore an Initial Study and either an EIR or Negative
20 Declaration are required.

21 43. In Exhibit B to Resolution No. 2020-13 approving the Project, the City Council
22 asserted for the first time that it was entitled to use CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 as an
23 exemption/streamlining provision for environmental review of the Project. Whilc CEQA
24 Guidelines Section 15183 permits streamlined environmental review of "projects which are
25 consistent with the devclopment density established by existing zoning, community plan, or
26 general plan policies for which an EIR was certified," streamlining does not authorize subsequent

27 projects to evade project-specific CEQA environmental review. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183.
28 Such projects arc subject to a rigorous set of CEQA requirements, including a determination of
Farella Bran• Martcl LLP .9- 3834913076929.6
235 Montgonery Sirrel. 17° Floor San Francisco, California 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (415÷954-4100

"whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site."

2 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(a).

44. Guidelines Section 15183 specifically references the use of an Initial Study to
4 evaluate whether any of the Project's environmental impacts:
(1) Are peculiar to the project or the parcel on which the project would be located,
(2) Were not analyzed as significant effects in a prior EIR on the zoning action,

7 general plan or community plan with which the project is consistent,

8 (3) Are potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts which were not discussed in the prior EIR prepared for the general plan, community plan or
9 zoning action, or

10 (4) Are previously identified significant effects which, as a result of substantial new 0. information which was not known at the time the EIR was certified, are determined
11 to have a more severe adverse impact than discussed in the prior EIR.

12 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(b) (emphasis added).

13 45. Furthermore, Section 15183 provides that "[t]his section does not affect any
14 requirement to analyze potentially significant offsite or cumulative impacts if those impacts were
15 not adequately discussed in the prior EIR." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(j). Because the Project
16 will have potentially significant offsite impacts that were not considered in the PA-1 Specific Plan
17 EIR, Section 15183 does not excuse the City's lack of project-specific analysis.

18 46. In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 provides that when an EIR has been
19 | certified, subsequent environmental review is required when:

20 New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous 21 EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the following: 22
(A)
23 The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or ncgative declaration;

24 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be-substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; 25
(C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible 26 would in fact bc feasible and would substantially reduce one or more
27 significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or

1 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to 2 adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

3 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15162(a)(3).

4 47. The Project's environmental impacts required further CEQA review under CEQA

5 Guidelines Sections 15183 and 15162 prior to its approval by the City, particularly in light of the
6 PA-1 EIR'S minimal and limited analysis of impacts. Thus, the City has failed to fulfill its
7 obligations under CEQA.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (CEQA Violations - Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)
10 48. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
11 contained in paragraphs 1 through 47 of this Petition.

12 49. It is undisputed that the City failed to perform any formal CEQA review for the
13 Project in connection with the discretionary decision of the City Council on January 28, 2020 to

14 deny Discovery's appeal and approve the Project design review in City Council Resolution No.
15 2020-13.

16 50. The City did not complete and circulate to the public an Initial Study for the
17 Project and did not prepare a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration or a project
18 level EIR for the Project, before its approval of the Project.

19 51. The City's discretionary design review approval for the Project is subject to
20 CEQA. As such, the City was specifically required to determine at the outset whether the Project

21 iS exempt from CEQA. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15061(a).

22 52. The Brentwood Planning Commission never made a determination whether the
23 Project was exempt from CEQA. Rather, in an environmental statement only three paragraphs
24 long in the Deccmber 17, 2019 Staff Report for the Planning Commission, City Staff generally
25 referred to the PA-1 EIR review of the site and asserted that "there is no new information or
26 substantial changes that require additional environmental review." On this wholly unsupported
27 | basis, the Planning Commission found that no site-specific CEQA analysis was required.

28 53. It is undisputed that the PA-1 EIR did not conduct any environmental review of the

Farella Braun • Mastel LEP 11 - 38349\13076929.6
215 Monigomery Street, 17° Floor San Francisco. California 94101 VERJFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (415) 954-4400

Amber Lane Apartments Project, which was first proposed to the City after the PA-1 EIR was
2 certified and the associated approvals for the PA-1 Specific Plan were adopted. Accordingly, the

3 PA-1 EIR only generally evaluated the properties within the 431-acre Specific Plan Area based on
4 assumptions regarding the type of development that would occur there. This type of "program"

5 level analysis did not include any Project-specific CEQA analysis.

6 54. On appeal, the City Council essentially came to the same unsupported conclusion

7 as the Planning Commission. In a new "Exhibit B" attached to the proposed City Council

8 approval Resolution issued two business days before the City Council appeal hearing, the City
9 stated that CEQA "exemption" in CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 applies to the Project. In
10 fact, this is mainly a "streamlining" provision that requires additional project-specific CEQA
11 review to be performed when "there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to
12 the project or its site." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(a).

13 55. The City concluded, on the basis of this informal environmental analysis prepared
14 | just before the appeal hearing, that no project-specific CEQA environmental review was required
15 for the Project. This environmental analysis is no more than a document prepared after-the-fact as
16 a prohibited post-hoc rationalization to justify decisions already made, and it is not comparable to
17 the rigorous and empirical Initial Study requirements and public comment process prescribed in
18 CEQA.

19 56. In fact, the limited environmental information before the City Council
20 demonstrated that the Project potentially could or definitely would have significant environmental
21 effects, including potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts. These impacts
22 include, but are not limited to, traffic impacts, stormwater control impacts, drainage impacts,
23 geology and soils impacts, protected species impacts, and noise impacts. All of these impacts will
24 directly and adversely affect development projects near the Amber Lane Apartments Project,
25 including Petitioners' Bridle Gate Project.

26 57. The City violated CEQA, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed
27 in the manner required by CEQA by the following actions and inactions:

28 (A) The City failed to prepare an Initial Study under CEQA Guidelines Section

Farello Braun+ Mantel LLP 12 38349413076929.6
235 Montgonery Sareet, 17" Floor San Francisco, California 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (415)954-4409

15168(c)(1);

2 (B) The City failed to determine under CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 that the

3 Project's impacts are peculiar to the project or parcel on which the Project would be
4 located, and/or that the Project has potentially significant off-site impacts and

5 cumulative impacts that were not discussed in the PA-1 EIR, and/or that

6 substantial new information demonstrates that significant effects will have a more

7 severe adverse impact, thereby requiring further CEQA review; and

8 (C) The City failed to determine that new information of substantial importance

9 regarding the Project within the meaning of CEQA Guidelines Section 15162
10 requires a that a subsequent EIR or Negative Declaration be prepared for the Project.
11 Each of these CEQA violations, by itself, compels the Court to vacate the City's approval of the
12 Project.

13 58. The City also violated CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion by attempting
14 to avoid CEQA requirements by deferring CEQA environmental assessment and mitigation of
15 admitted significant effects. of the Project by stating that there will be later studies to address these
16 impacts and identify mitigation. This approach is directly contrary to CEQA's requirement that
17 this analysis and formulation of appropriate mitigation measures must occur before the Project is

18 approved. See, e.g., California Native Plant Soc'y v. City of Ranch Cordova, 172 Cal. App. 4th
19 603, 621 (2009).
20 59. The City also violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The City
21 improperly limited its CEQA findings only to effects that it deemed to be attributable to the
22 design review approval. Not only did the City draw an artificial and unsupportable distinction
23 between the types of environmental impacts that the Project would cause, but it failed to realize
24°l that its Municipal Code requires an analysis of potential adverse off-site impacts, including on
25| adjacent property developments. In addition, the City's findings do not provide adequatc
26 reasoning or the requisite analysis that properly leads from facts to legal findings.
27 60. As a result of these CEQA inadequacies and others according to proof, the City

28 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA in

1 failing to conduct adequate CEQA environmental review for the Amber Lane Apartments Project.
2 The City's approval of the Project must therefore be set aside and vacated.

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violations of Brentwood Municipal Code Design Review - Chapter 17.820, et seq.)

6 61. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
7 contained in paragraphs 1 through 60 of this Petition.

8 62. In order to approve design review for the Project, the City purported to make the
9 requisite design review findings under Brentwood Municipal Code Section 17.820.008, which
10 provides:

11 The following criteria shall be applied in considering all applications for design and

12 site development review approval:

13 A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilities on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and

14 loading facilities, lighting, signing and access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.

15 B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects
on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, 16 topography or traffic.

17 63. At the time of the City Council's approval, the detailed designs for key
18 components of the Project had yet to be submitted, including landscape plans for street frontage
19 | landscape areas and exterior lighting. Furthermore, the City was aware that the Project's
20 proposed signage was inconsistent with Section 17.640.008 of the Municipal Code.

21 64. Moreover, the City's environmental analysis was inadequate to support a finding
22 that the Project would not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments. The
23 City performed inadequate analysis of environmental impacts, including but not limited to
24 drainage, stormwater control, noise, and traffic, all of which would have potentially significant
25 adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments.

26 65. The City attempted to circumvent its design review obligations through the
27 imposition of conditions of approval that require Real Party Tekin to complete and submit further
28 plans associated with the proposed Project. However, in order to make the required findings and

Farella 1aun Murtel LLP 14 - 38349\13076929.6
235 Momgomery Street, 17" Floor fan lrancisco, Catifornia 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
(4151 951-4400

properly approve Design Review for the Project, the City was obligated to obtain and review such

2 information prior to Project approval.

66. The City did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the Project meets the
4 applicable criteria for design review approval with regard to Project features and impacts such as
carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, signage, and

6 environmental impacts. Accordingly, the City's decision to approve design review for the Project
was not made on an adequate evidentiary basis in light of the applicable legal standard, which
8 requires that findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence
9  contained in the administrative record. See Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Cmty. V. Cty. of Los
10 Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515 (1974) (holding that a court "must scrutinize the record and
11 determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency's findings and
12 | whether these findings support the agency's decision").

13 67. Rather than approve the Project with conditions of approval requiring the
14 Applicant to submit further information, the City was required to deny approval of the Project or
15 to defer its consideration of the Project until the requisite findings could be made and project-
16 specific adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments could be analyzed.

17 68. As a result of these failures and others according to proof, the City prejudicially
18 abused its discretion in failing to conduct adequate design and associated environmental review
19 for the Amber Lane Apartments Project. Therefore, its approval of the Project must be set aside.
20 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relicf as hereinafter set forth.

21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

23 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to set aside and vacate the
24 City's approval of Resolution No. 2020-13 denying Petitioner Discovery's appeal and granting
25 the design review application for the Amber Lane Apartments Project;

26 2. For peremptory writs of mandate directing the City to comply with CEQA and the

150 City Park Way
Brentwood, CA 94513

Re: Appeal of Amber Lane Apartments Project Approval City Council Agenda, January 28, 2020, Item No. D(1)

Dear Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council:
On behalf of Discovery Builders, Inc. and West Coast Home Builders, Inc. (collectively "Discovery"), we hereby present the legal grounds and reasons why the Brentwood City Council should reverse the Planning Commission decision and deny the design review application (DR- 10-010) and lot merger application for the Amber Lane Apartments Project ("Project"). Discovery is a longtime developer in the City of Brentwood ("City") and is in the process of developing a project in the immediate vicinity of the Amber Lane Project which would be directly impacted by the Project issues raised herein.

I. INTRODUCTION

On December 17, 2019, the Planning Commission, acting on the recommendation of City Staff, approved the 288-unit Project. Discovery filed written comments opposing the Project before and at the Planning Commission hearing. These letters are enclosed herewith as Exhibits "A" and "B," and are incorporated herein by reference. On December 20, 2019, Discovery filed timely appeal to the Brentwood City Council ("City Council") of the Planning Commission decision approving the Project. A copy of this appeal (without attachments) is enclosed herewith as Exhibit "C" and is incorporated herein by reference.
As explained in detail below, the City has failed to comply with its obligations under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), in connection with its proposed approval of the Project, and is thereby barred from taking any action on the underlying Project approvals. The Project lies within the area covered by the City's PA-1 Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"). The City failed to perform adequate specific CEQA review in connection with the Planning Commission approvals. Rather, contrary to the clcar legal requirements of CEQA, the City found that no further environmental review was

required, despite having an insufficient evidentiary basis for such a finding. Because the Planning Commission's cursory environmental review did little more than reference the program level Environmental Impact Report prepared for the Specific Plan ("Specific Plan EIR"), the City's approval of the Project failed to mect CEQA's clear requirements for a site-specific environmental analysis. The material included in the agenda packet for this City Council meeting does not change this conclusion in any respect.
Pursuant to the Brentwood Municipal Code, the City Council must perform a de novo review of the Planning Commission's decision. Municipal Code § 17.0880.030(E). Under the Municipal Code, the City Council is empowered to affirm, modify, or reverse that decision. Municipal Code § 17.880.030(F).
For these and other reasons, which are explained in more detail below, the City Council must reverse the Planning Commission's decision and deny the requested Project approvals. The Project cannot be approved unless and until the full analysis required by CEQA is performed.

II. BACKGROUND FACTS

On August 8, 2019, Tekin & Associates, LLC (Applicant") submitted the Project application to the City of Brentwood, requesting approval of a design review application (DR 19- 010) for the development of a 288-unit apartment complex on three adjacent parcels of undeveloped land within the Specific Plan arca. On September 6, 2019, the City informed the Applicant that the application was incomplete and that additional information was required. Following the Applicant's resubmittal on October 4, 2019, the Project was once again deemed incomplete in an October 10, 2019 letter from the City. On October 8, Tekin & Associates submitted a Lot Merger (LLA 19-008) application to the Public Works Engineering Division to merge three parcels, totaling 14.4 acres, into one parcel.
The Project application was eventually deemed complete and was slated to appear on the Planning Commission agenda for the meeting on December 3, 2019. On that day, Discovery's attorneys submitted a letter to the Planning Commission objecting to the approval, pointing out a number of inadequacies in the Planning Commission's review, including the omission of any provisions relating to impacts on fire and emergency services and lack of project-specific CEQA review. See Exhibit "A." At that night's Planning Commission meeting, Planning Manager Erik Nolthenius informed the Commission that the letter raised issues requiring staff review and requested that the matter be continued. Subsequently, Conditions of Approval were added that required the Applicant to address fire and emergency services impacts by paying a fire development impact fce and requesting that the Project site be annexed into Community Facilities District. Nevertheless, the Project was quickly rescheduled for consideration at the December 17, 2019 Planning Commission meeting, where it was approved despite the submittal of an additional objection letter from Discovery's attorneys detailing the inadequacies of the City's CEQA analysis and design review. See Exhibit "B."
On January 24, 2020, City Staff posted the agenda packet for this City Council meeting, which included a short staff response to the appeal letter and a document purporting to be an

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 • BRAUN+ MARTEL ULP

Page

"Environmental Analysis" for the Project. This Environmental Analysis, which was not dated, appears to have been produced after the Planning Commission decision, in response to Discovery's appeal letter. In this document, City Staff asserts, for the first time, that CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 was used to streamline the environmental review process. Although the Environmental Analysis attempts to discuss a variety of environmental issues, it does not document performance of the additional analysis called for in the Specific Plan EIR. Moreover, as explained in further detail below, the City should have, and did not, prepare a Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration under CEQA. Accordingly, the required CEQA analysis has not been done and the Project cannot be approved.
The Project's expedited timeline stands in stark contrast to the City's treatment of other development projects, many of which must go through years-long staff evaluations before being considered for approval by the Planning Commission. As evidenced by the omission of the fire and emergency services provisions which would have gone completely unnoticed were it not for Discovery's letter--the City has been intent on rushing the Project through the approval process. Ultimately, the City's haste has allowed the Project to speed through without full and careful consideration of environmental impacts or design review.

III. THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT APPROVE THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT HAS
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ITS IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OBLIGATIONS.

In order to safeguard against abuses of power, California public agencies are required to use a their discretion in a manner that is objectively reasonable and supported by evidence. In evaluating public agency decisions, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 holds that an agency has abused its discretion if its "findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record." Furthermore, "[a] prejudicial abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, if its decision is not supported by findings, or if its findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.' Sierra Club v. Cty. of Napa, 121 Cal. App. 4th 1490, 1497 (2004).
Accordingly, California courts have described "two types of error which may constitute an abuse of discretion under CEQA." Save Panoche Valley v. San Benito Cty., 217 Cal. App. 4th 503, 514 (2013). First, "an agency may fail to proceed in the manner laid out under the CEQA

The sudden appcarance of the new "Environmental Analysis" raises more questions than it answers. This document is undated and was not contained in the documents available to
the public and reviewed by the Planning Commission before or at the time it made its decision. It appcared publicly for the first time four days ago and appears to be a prohibited after-the-fact justification for the Planning Commission decision, According to City Staff, this document "further augments and provides additional substantial evidence to support staff's determination." To the contrary, it fails to meet the requirements of CEQA and certainly cannot be used to support the Planning Commission decision or provide any CEQA platform for a City Council
decision.

regulations." Id. Second, "an agency may reach factual determinations under CEQA that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record." Id. In the CEQA context, "substantial evidence" means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 102 Cal. App. 4th 656, 675 (2002) (quoting 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15384).
Here, the Planning Commission clearly abused its discretion by approving the Project without performing the necessary project-specific environmental review under CEQA. As will be described further below, the City neglected and ignored the prescribed CEQA steps for utilizing CEQA streamlining processes and failed to perform the analysis required for site- specific review of a project undertaken in an area which has a programmatic EIR. Moreover, the City did not rely on any evidence whatsoever, let alone substantial evidence, in concluding that the Project will not have any potential environmental impacts that were not considered by the Specific Plan EIR. This is contrary to the clear mandate of California law, which requires that an agency's decision must be based on findings, and that such findings must be based on substantial evidence in light of the whole record. Sierra Club, supra, 121 Cal. App. 4th at 1497; Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.

To avoid abusing its discretion here, the City Council must reverse the Planning Commission's approval of the Project.

A. The Planning Commission Failed To Properly Identify Or Apply A CEQA Exemption Or Streamlining Provision Applicable To The Project.
Under CEQA, the first step public agency must take is "to determine whether the proposed project is subject to CEQA review in the first instance." Berkeley Hillside Pres. V. City of Berkeley, 60 Cal. 4th 1086, 1099 (2015). Then, "[o]nce a lead agency has determined that an activity is a project subject to CEQA, a lead agency shall determine whether the project is exempt from CEQA." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15061(a). §
Here, the City appeared to recognize that the Project is subject to CEQA review, although it never explicitly so stated. Regardless, it is absolutely clear that this Project is subject to CEQA. However, the City failed to perform the next step. Nowhere in any of the Project approval documents did the City indicate whether the Project is exempt from CEQA or, if so, which
exemption supposedly applies. As California courts have recognized, "[t]he city's consideration of whether [an] exemption applies is itself an environmental review." Concerned Dublin Citizens v. City of Dublin, 214 Cal. App. 4th 1301, 1317 (2013). Accordingly, "[an] agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." Davidon Homes V.
City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 117 (1997).
Here, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the Planning Commission's environmental determination. While City Staff belatedly prepared a document purporting to support the application of Guidelines Section 15183 to the Project (which is a "streamlining"

38349113012879.2

provision, not a full exemption), there is no indication that this document informed the prior decision of the Planning Commission. Furthermore, this Environmental Analysis does not demonstrate that potential impacts of the project were sufficiently analyzed for purposes of the City Council decision. To the contrary, there are multiple potential environmental impacts that the City failed to adequately consider, as described further below.

B. The Planning Commission Failed To Adequately Consider Possible Project- Specific Environmental Impacts In Light Of The PA-1 Specific Plan.
The concept of performing sequential environmental review--often called "tiering"--has long been permitted under CEQA, so long as it is done properly. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "[t]iering is properly used to defer analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases when the impacts or mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval decision but are specific to the later phases." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007). Using a prior EIR to streamline subsequent environmental review is intended to reduce redundant environmental review, not to permit subsequent projects to avoid individualized environmental review altogether. Rather, the benefit of tiering from a program EIR is that it "allows an agency to defer analysis of certain details of later phases of long-term linked or complex projects until those phases are up for approval." Id.
Here, the City did not properly perform the project-specific analysis that the PA-1 Specific Plan purposely deferred. The City relied entirely on the Specific Plan in finding that 10 environmental review of the Project was required. As described in the Staff Report before the Planning Commission, the entirety of the City's "environmental review" is as follows:
The City previously prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (State Clearinghouse No. 2018042064) in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the entire PA-1 Specific Plan area. The environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review. However, as identified in the EIR noise chapter, any future development within the plan area is required to obtain a noise study. As such, Veneklasen Associates prepared a noise study for the proposed Amber Lanc Apartment development project, and concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. Any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant.

The PA-1 EIR identified several potentially-significant impacts; however, mitigation measures are incorporated to reduce those impacts to less than significant levels. All mitigation measures in the EIR and noise report not addressed by the standard conditions of approval are included as project-specific conditions of approval. No further environmental review is required at this time.

The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre- construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat or species are found during pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.
Staff Report, pp. 10-11 (emphasis added).
The thrust of the City's statement is that all necessary environmental review was performed in the Specific Plan EIR. However, rather than examining the Project in light of the analysis performed in the Specific Plan EIR, the City relies on a generalized conclusion regarding the Project's consistency with the Specific Plan. This unsupported and conjectural level of analysis is woefully insufficient to satisfy either CEQA or the requirements of the PA-1 Specific Plan itself.
CEQA requires that "[w]hen a program EIR is used to avoid preparing subsequent EIR's, such as here, the public agency must examine site-specific program activities 'in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional environmental document must be prepared.' Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Dep't of Fish & Wildlife, 234 Cal. App. 4th 214, 238 (2015). Furthermore, as the Specific Plan EIR states, "[d]evelopment projects in the Specific Plan Area that require further discretionary approvals will be examined in light of this EIR to determine whether additional environmental documentation must be prepared." Draft EIR ("DEIR"), p. ES-1.3 Here, the City did not perform adequate project-specific analyses, nor is there substantial evidence in the record to support the City's approval.

1. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168
CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 provides the specific requirements for environmental review of projects undertaken pursuant to a program EIR. The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR specifically acknowledges a that it is a program EIR. DEIR, p. ES-1 ("This EIR has been prepared as a Program EIR pursuant to CEQA•Guidelines Section 15168."). Therefore, the requirements of Section 15168 directly apply.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c) provides that "[l]ater activities in the program must be examined in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional environmental document must be prepared." Specifically, "[i]f a later activity would have effects that were not examined in the program EIR, new initial study would need to be prepared leading (0 either an

EIR or a negative declaration." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(c)(1) (emphasis added). Here, numerous effects of the Project were not examined in the Specific Plan EIR and therefore an initial study and either an EIR or negative declaration are required. See Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz, 131 Cal. App. 4th 1170, 1180 (2005) ("It is now well established, however, that an initial study is the preliminary environmental analysis and its purposes include proving the lead agency with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an EIR or negative declaration, enabling an applicant or lead agency to modify a project, mitigating adverse impacts before an EIR is prepared, thereby enabling the project to qualify for a negative declaration, and providing documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment.") (internal alterations and quotations omitted). As described further below, the Project's effects include, but are not limited to, potential impacts relating to traffic, geology and soils, stormwater control, and
noise.

Although the Project site was considered for high density residential development, the record indicates that an insufficient project-specific analysis was performed. This runs contrary to CEQA'S purpose and requirements with regard to the use of program EIRs. See Ctr. for Biological Diversity, supra, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 238. While the Specific Plan EIR addressed certain high-level impacts caused by residential developments in general, it did not, and did not purport to, analyze the particular environmental impacts discussed in Section III.C. Instead, the Specific Plan EIR deliberately deferred analysis of these potential impacts. By neglecting to perform this analysis, the City is avoiding completing the necessary environmental review.
Section 15168 also requires that "[w]here the later activities involve site specific
operations, the agency should use a written checklist or similar device to document the evaluation of the site and the activity to determine whether the environmental effects of the operation were within the scope of the program EIR." 14 Cal. Code Regs: 15168(c)(4). In this case, there is no evidence that the Planning Commission analyzed the site-specific impacts of the Project nor that it utilized a "written checklist or similar device" to document the analysis. Accordingly, the City failed to fulfill its obligations under CEQA with regard to approval of a later activity undertaken pursuant to a program EIR.
The newly created Environmental Analysis does not change this conclusion in any respect. It is not equivalent to an Initial Study because it does not contain the five boxes (or equivalent) for each environmental area to document whether there are significant impacts, whether they are less than significant due to mitigation, and whether this is mitigation addressed by uniformly applicable development policies. Rather, it appears to be no more than a non- scientific justification for decisions already made. Rather, the analyses contained therein require the preparation of at least a Ncgative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration, with circulation for public review and comment.

2. PA-1 Specific Plan EIR
By failing to perform adequate project-specific analysis, the City ignored the commands of the PA-1 Specific Plan that it purports to rely upon. Throughout the Specific Plan EIR, that

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+ MARTEL LLP

Page 8

document acknowledges its shortcomings and specifically calls for project-specific environmental analysis. For example, the Specific Plan EIR states in numerous instances that "[b]ased upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed, site-specific information on this impact is not feasible." E.g., DEIR, p. 3.9-16. Such statements are not invitations to ignore environmental review of such impacts, but instead indicate that project- specific analysis is required. See DEIR, p. 3.9-16 ("However, each future project must include detailed project specific drainage plans that control storm water runoff and erosion, both during and after construction.").
City Staff improperly believes that no further project-specific analysis is necessary. In the sentence describing the Project analysis in light of the Specific Plan EIR, the Planning Commission decision asserts: "[t]he environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site were analyzed in the EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review." Resolution No. 19-038 at 1. This statement reflects a basic misunderstanding of the role played by the Specific Plan EIR in the environmental review process. Where a project is a undertaken pursuant to a program EIR, project-specific information relating to the subsequent project warrants individual analysis. See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles, 103 Cal. App. 4th 268, 284-85 (2002) (rejecting city's approval of project pursuant to prior programmatic EIR where city performed insufficient project-specific analysis). This is particularly true in cases where, as here, the program EIR did not identify or analyze the subsequent project whatsoever. Perhaps the City is improperly confusing its obligations for site- specific analysis with the provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15162, which requires a previously certified EIR to be supplemented when certain significant new information arises. Regardless, the City cannot point to the Specific Plan EIR for analysis that the EIR did not perform.

Nor can the City simply defer all environmental analysis through the imposition of conditions of approval. Sundstrom v. Cty. of Mendocino, 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307 (1988) (*By deferring environmental assessment to future date, the conditions run counter to that policy of CEQA which requires environmental review at the earliest feasible stage in the planning process."). This is because "[t]he determination of whether a project will have significant environmental impacts, and the formulation of measures to mitigate those impacts, must occur before the project is approved." California Native Plant Soc'y v. City of Rancho Cordova, 172 Cal. App. 4th 603, 621 (2009). Here, the City evidently assumed that the mitigation measurcs identified in the Specific Plan EIR are sufficient to render all potential impacts of the Project insignificant, despite neglecting to assess project-specific impacts not considered in the Specific Plan EIR. Furthermore, the generalized Conditions of Approval requiring the Project to comply with various provisions of the Municipal Code relating to environmental impacts do not constitute CEQA mitigation measures for project-specific impacts.
Quite simply, the Planning Commission improperly approved the Project before it determined whether there were any project-specific impacts that were potentially significant. Accordingly, it can neither rely on the Specific Plan EIR's more general mitigation measures nor defer project-specific mitigation measures until later analysis. See Rialto Citizens for

38349\3012879.2

Page 9

Responsible Growth v. City of Rialto, 208 Cal. App. 4th 899, 945 (2012) (describing the general rule against deferred mitigation measures). As the California Supreme Court has stated, "CEQA's demand for meaningful information 'is not satisfied by simply stating information will be provided in the future." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007). Permitting the City to bypass the project-specific analysis called for by the Specific Plan EIR would undermine the "[f]undamental purpose of CEQA ... to ensure that environmental considerations play a significant role in governmental decision-making." Joshua Tree Downtown Bus. All. v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 1 Cal. App. 5th 677, 683 (2016) (internal quotations omitted).

C. The Project Is Inconsistent With And Disregards The PA-1 Specific Plan.
Thus, the City's threadbare environmental review relied entirely on the general program environmental review contained in the PA-1 Specific Plan EIR, despite that document's clear warnings that site-specific review was not done for many of the project-specific impacts identified in this section. Furthermore, even if the City intends to rely on a CEQA exemption based on the Specific Plan, it can only it do so to the extent that the Project is consistent with the PA-1 Specific Plan, as explained further in Section D below. The numerous inconsistencies between the Project and the Specific Plan preclude such a finding here and make clear that the City must perform substantial further analysis in order to fulfill its CEQA obligations.

1. Traffic

The recently prepared Environmental Analysis relies on a traffic study and related analysis the City prepared for the Specific Plan EIR. As raised in prior comment letters submitted on behalf of Discovery during the Specific Plan EIR process (attached hereto as Exhibits "D" and "E" and incorporated herein by reference), the Specific Plan EIR failed to address a number of impacts relating to traffic, including likely increases in traffic to the south of the Specific Plan area, where Discovery has proposed a project. Furthermore, the Specific Plan EIR did not address the request of the California Department of Transportation for an analysis of certain additional intersections.

However, in light of the City's reliance on the Specific Plan EIR for analysis of the Project's impacts on traffic and circulation, the most critical deficiency of the traffic study is its outdated data. The Specific Plan EIR analyzed existing intersection operations using traffic volumes collected in the fall of 2016. DEIR, p. 3.14-14. Given the rapid growth of Brentwood during this period, this data can no longer be considered adequately current and must be updated. The CalTrans Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impacts Studies states that "[g]encrally a [traffic impact study] requires updating every two years" and "may require updating sooner in rapidly developing areas." Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies, State of California Department of Transportation, p. 5. In a quickly growing city a such as Brentwood, traffic data that is more than three years old cannot be relied upon for project-specific analysis, particularly in light of the deficiencies originally identified in the Specific Plan EIR's circulation analysis. In addition, it is not clear that the numerous mitigation measures identified in the Specific Plan EIR-which call for numerous improvements to be made by the Cityhave been

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA

Page 10

completed. DEIR, pp. ES-26-ES-27. At the very least, a focused traffic memorandum or re- evaluation of traffic volumes at impacted intersections should be prepared.
In light of the above, the City's existing analysis of the Project's potential impact on traffic is deficient and must be updated in order to comply with CEQA.

2. Geology and Soils

The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR acknowledges the potential for significant impacts stemming from seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction. DEIR, p. 3.6-18. Accordingly, the Specific Plan EIR requires that "[a]ll future projects within the Specific Plan Area would be required to prepare geotechnical soils investigations to address seismic safety issues and provide adequate mitigation for potential hazards identified." DEIR, p. 3.6-19. Specifically, Action SA 1a "[r]equire[s] the submission of geologic and soils reports for all new developments" and further provides that "[t]he geologic risk areas that are determined from these studies shall have standards established and recommendations shall be incorporated into development." DEIR, p. 3.6-19. Here, there is no evidence that the required investigations have been conducted or that the necessary reports were completed for the Project. The recently prepared Environmental Analysis indicates that further analysis is being improperly deferred, stating that "[t]he proposed project would be required to prepare geotechnical soils investigations to address seismic safety issues and provide adequate mitigation for potential hazards identified." Environmental Analysis, p. 148. Therefore, the Project is not in compliance with the Specific Plan and the City's environmental review is incomplete and inadequate.

3. Stormwater Control

The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR acknowledges the possible impact of development on stormwater-related violations of water quality standards or waste discharge requirements. To mitigate these potential impacts, Policy IF 4-3 "[r]equire{s] all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site and/or conveyed to the nearest drainage facility as part of the development review process and as required by the City's NPDES Municipal Regional Permit." DEIR, p. 3.9-16. Furthermore, "Project applicants shall mitigate any drainage impacts as necessary." DEIR, p. 3.9-16.
Similarly, Policy SA 2-2 consists of the following provisions:
Require all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site, treated, and/or conveyed to the ncarest drainage facility as part of the development review process. Project applicants shall demonstrate that project implementation would not result in increases in the peak flow runoff to adjacent lands or drainage facilities that would exceed the design capacity of the drainage facility or result in an increased potential for offsite
flooding.

38349113012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+ MARTEL LLP

Page 11

DEIR, p. 3.9-17. Here, there is no evidence that the Project Applicant has submitted the required reports and detailed studies or been required to make the environmental showings required by these policies in the Specific Plan EIR. Nevertheless, the recently prepared Environmental Analysis makes the conclusory statement that "[t]he proposed project would not substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or the area.' Environmental Analysis, p. 155. This purported conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
Furthermore, it appears that the City has not complied with Brentwood Municipal Code's stormwater control provisions. While Condition of Approval 12.i states that the "Permittee shall comply with the ... Brentwood Municipal Code Chapter 14.20 'Stormwater Management and Discharge Control,'* this instruction impermissibly defers the required mitigation under the Municipal Code. Municipal Code Section 14.20.050(A) provides that "every application for a development project, including, but not limited to, a rezoning, tentative map, parcel map, conditional use permit, variance, site development permit, design review, or building permit that is subject to the development runoff requirements in the city's NPDES permit shall be accompanied by a stormwater control plan that meets the criteria in the most recent version of the Contra Costa Clean Water Program Stormwater C.3. Guidebook." (Emphasis added.) This provision indicates that the stormwater control plan must be submitted along with the design review application, which does not appear to have been done in this case and is not included in the Project documents that have been provided.
The recently prepared Environmental Analysis indicates that such plans remain hypothetical. That document states that "[t]he proposed project is a C.3 regulated project and is required to include appropriate site design measures, source controls, and hydraulically-sized stormwater treatment measures." Environmental Analysis, p. 155. The City's approval of the Project thus failed to incorporate the requirements of the Municipal Code.
In light of the foregoing requirements and the absence of evidence that the Project complied, it is clear that there are potential Project stormwater impacts that have not been properly evaluated by the City, thereby barring the grant of any Project approvals.

4. Drainage
With regard to potential impacts of devclopment on drainage patterns, the PA-1 Specific Plan recognizes that "[bJased upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed, site-specific information on this impact is not feasible." DEIR, p. 3.9-19. Thus, to address potential site-specific impacts, the Specific Plan EIR includes the following requirement:
Each future development project must also include detailed project specific floodplain and drainage studies that assess the drainage characteristics and flood risks so that an appropriate storm drainage plan can be prepared to control storm water runoff, both during and after construction. The drainage plan will ultimately include project specific best management measures that are designed to allow for natural recharge and infiltration of stormwater. Construction of storm drainage improvements would occur as part of an overall development project and

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 12

is considered in the environmental impacts associated with project construction and implementation as addressed throughout this EIR.
DEIR, p. 3.9-19. This section of the Specific Plan EIR also incorporates Policy FI 4-3 and Policy SA 2-2, both of which are required under the stormwater control elements of the EIR, as described in Section III. C.3 above. As described therein, these policies require development projects to demonstrate how stormwater runoff will be contained and that project implementation will not result in increases in peak flow runoff that will exceed the capacity of drainage facilities or increase the potential for flooding. DEIR, pp. 3.9-19-20.
There is no evidence that the Project Applicant performed the studies or demonstrations required to ensure the Project has no significant impacts with regard to drainage. Therefore, the project-specific environmental review envisioned by the Specific Plan EIR has not taken place and the City's approval violates CEQA.

5. Noise

As acknowledged in the Staff Report and Planning Commission Resolution No. 19-038,
future developments within the PA-1 Specific Plan area are required to obtain noise studies. The Staff Report indicates that a noise study was prepared for the Project, which "concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report." Staff Report, p. 10. Moreover, "[a]ny alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant." Staff Report, p. 10; Resolution 19-038, p. 1. However, neither the study nor the requirements of the report are provided or incorporated into the Conditions of Approval.
By permitting a consultant to devise mitigation measures and monitor the Project Applicant's compliance, the City has "improperly delegate[d] the [City's] legal responsibility to assess environmental impact." Sundstrom v. Cty. of Mendocino, 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307 (1988). Furthermore, the City appears to have imposed insufficient mitigation measures to address the potential noise impacts from the Project. Accordingly, the City's environmental review was insufficient under CEQA.

6. Project Density
The PA-1 Specific Plan provides for 405 units within the high density residential ("HDR") zone, which totals 27.02 acres within the Specific Plan area. PA-1 Specific Plan, Table 3.12-4. The Specific Plan EIR relies on this figure to evaluate numerous environmental impacts of the Specific Plan, including traffic and air quality. PA-1 Specific Plan, p. 3.3-29. However, due to the density of this Project, the remaining HDR portion of the Specific Plan area will necessarily be inconsistent with the Specific Plan.

As approved, the Project consists of 288 units on 14.4 acres. Because there are 27.02
total acres approved for HDR development-requiring a minimum of ten units per acre the a remaining 12.62 acres must have a minimum of 126 units in order to fulfill the Specific Plan's

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 13

density requirements. However, 126 additional units will result in a total of 414 units-which
exceeds the 405 HDR units on which the Specific Plan EIR's projections are based. Moreover, if subsequent HDR development has density at the upper end of the permitted density range, the total number of HDR units might exceed the Specific Plan's projections by as many as 145 units. This would render much of the Specific Plan EIR's analysis inaccurate, especially with regard to issues such as traffic and air quality. Accordingly, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific
Plan because it will likely cause subsequent HDR development to exceed the Specific Plan's projected number of HDR units.

D. The Project Is Not Properly Subject To CEQA Streamlining Or Exemptions.
Not until the filing of the instant appeal did the City indicate whether it was attempting to bypass further review through CEQA exemption or streamlining. The recently prepared Environmental Analysis states that the City is relying upon the streamlining provision of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183. However, Section 15183 does not excuse the City's failure to perform analysis of the environmental issues discussed above, nor does the CEQA exemption applicable to Specific Plan projects apply here.

1. CEQA Streamlining - Guidelines Section 15183
While CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 permits streamlined environmental review of "projects which are consistent with the development density established by existing zoning, community plan, or general plan policies for which an EIR was certified," streamlining does not permit subsequent projects to evade environmental review altogether. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. Such projects are subject to a rigorous set of CEQA requirements, including a determination of "whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its sitc." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. Guidelines Section 15183 specifically references the use of an initial study to evaluate whether any of the Project's environmental impacts:

(1) Are peculiar to the project or the parcel on which the project would be located, (2) Wcre not analyzed as significant a effects in a prior EIR on the zoning action, general plan or community plan with which the project is consistent, (3) Are potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts which were not discussed in the prior EIR prepared for the general plan, community plan or zoning action, or
(4) Are previously identified significant effects which, as a result of substantial new information which was not known at the time the EIR was certified, are determined to have a more severe adverse impact than discussed in the prior EIR.
14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(b).

Here, the Project's potential impacts on traffic, stormwater control, drainage, and noise, among others, may fall into onc of these categories. However, because the City never performed an Initial Study, there is insufficient evidence for the City to make a determination as to the

38349\3012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN + MARTEL I.LP

Page 14

Project's impacts. In its response to Discovery's appeal, City Staff refers to its recently prepared Environmental Analysis as 'an environmental checklist evaluation, similar to an abbreviated Initial Study." Thus, Staff acknowledges that it did not prepare a full Initial Study. Accordingly, Staff did not fulfill the requirements of Guidelines Section 15183. Moreover, the Environmental Analysis relies primarily on conclusory statements or proposals for later review, neither of which suffices for project-specific environmental analysis. See Leonoff v. Monterey Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 222 Cal. App. 3d 1337, 1346, (1990) (holding that "[t]o facilitate review, the initial study should contain supporting evidence and not mere conclusions about potential environmental effects"); Vineyard Area Citizens, supra, 40 Cal. 4th at 431 (holding that "simply stating information will be provided in the future" does not satisfy CEQA).
Nevertheless, even if the Environmental Analysis were deemed adequate as an Initial Study (which it is not), the City neglected to complete the environmental process by preparing a Negative Declaration. Guidelines Section 15183 permits agencies to avoid performing redundant environmental review that is already contained in prior EIR. Here, even the Environmental Analysis supports the conclusion that certain project-specific impacts will require further study and possible mitigation. Simply acknowledging such impacts in an Initial Study would not be adequateeven if finding that no Project impacts are potentially significant, the City must memorialize that finding in a Negative Declaration, which requires a more empirical analysis than has been provided so far. See Aptos Council v. Cty. of Santa Cruz, 10 Cal. App. 5th 266, 287 (2017) ("A decision by an agency to adopt a negative declaration is essentially a determination that the project will not have a significant environmental impact.").
To the extent that the City would rely on appropriate mitigation measures for a finding that no significant effects will occur, a Mitigated Negative Declaration would be required. See Sullivan v. City of San Luis Obispo, No. B158882, 2003 WL 22211538, at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) (stating a negative declaration is appropriate "where potentially significant environmental effects are identified but mitigated by project revisions to a point where no significant effects will occur"). Accordingly, the City cannot rely on the streamlining provisions of Guidelines Section 15183 in order to avoid the preparation and required public review and comment for an
additional CEQA environmental document.

2. CEQA Exemption - Guidelines Section 15182
CEQA Guidelines Section 15182 provides that "a residential project undertaken pursuant to and in conformity to [a] specific plan is exempt from CEQA." 14 CCR § 15182(c)(1). This mirrors the exemption contained in Govt. Code section 65457, which provides that "[a]ny residential development project, including any subdivision, or any zoning change that is undertaken to implement and is consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified after January 1, 1980" is exempt from CEQA. However, as detailed above, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan in numerous ways. The Project fails to implement the Spccific Plan requirements with regard to traffic, geology and soils, stormwater control, drainage, noise, and project density. These omissions are not minor discrepancies, as they contravene explicit requirements of the Specific Plan. Furthermore, development of the Project will, as previously explained, require subsequent development

projects to either exceed the 405 HDR units envisioned by the Specific Plan or contain a density of less than the 10 units per acre required by the Specific Plan.
The Specific Plan EIR states that its program-level analysis considers the broad environmental effects of the proposed PA-I Specific Plan to allow comprehensive consideration of the reasonably anticipated scope of future development within the Plan area but that "not all aspects of the future development are known at this stage in the planning process, as there are no specific development applications currently pending within the Plan area." DEIR, p. 1.0-2. Accordingly, the Specific Plan calls for subsequent project-specific review, which CEQA permits. See Town of Atherton v. California High-Speed Rail Auth., 228 Cal. App. 4th 314, 344 (2014) (permitting program EIR to defer development of site-specific information "until such time as the lead agency prepares a future environmental document in connection with a project of a more limited geographic scale"). Avoiding the subsequent site-specific review called for by the Specific Plan EIR renders the Project inconsistent with the Specific Plan. Accordingly, Guidelines Section 15182 clearly would not exempt the Project from further CEQA review.

IV. THE CITY'S DESIGN REVIEW APPROVAL WAS IMPROPER.

A. The City's Findings Were Based On Insufficient Evidence.

The City's approval of the Project purports to make the requisite findings pursuant to Municipal Code Section 17.820.008, which provides:
The following criteria shall be applied in considering all applications for design and site development review approval:
A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilities on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and loading facilities, lighting, signing and access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.
B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or traffic.

The applicable findings included within Planning Commission Resolution 19-038 state in
part:

The siting and internal arrangement of the structure and circulation, parking and loading, lighting, access, landscape, hardscape, signing, and utility facilities on the site are conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient, and harmonious development insomuch as the buildings are is designed in such a way as to provide an attractive and interesting street scene from Amber Lane and Shady Willow Lane. The building is designed to reduce massing and introduce development on a scale that is appropriate and consistent with the PA-1 Specific Plan with hardscape and landscaping to provide an attractive development.

Page 16

Resolution 19-038, p. 3.
However, the submittal of detailed designs for key design components of the Project, including the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, and signage, have yet to be submitted. For example, as explained in the Staff Report, "elevations, materials and design of the carport is not depicted in the project plans, and staff included a draft condition of approval requiring the design of the carports to be brought before the Design Review Subcommittee to ensure consistency with the rest of the complex." Staff Report, p. 5.
In addition, the Staff Report recognizes that the Project's "proposed signage is not consistent with the City's Municipal Code in that it exceeds the maximum number of
freestanding signs per parcel." Staff Report, p. 7. The City attempted to remedy these deficiencies by imposing Conditions of Approval Nos. 6 to 9, which require that the Project Applicant submit further plans regarding carports, landscaping, exterior lighting, and signage to the Community Development Department. Exhibit A to Resolution 19-038, p. 1. However, the fact that this further information is required for a full analysis of these Project elements only makes it more obvious that the City had insufficient details to properly make the required design review findings. The City cannot use Conditions of Approval to circumvent design review.
Accordingly, the City's decision to approve design review was not made on an adequate evidentiary basis. Findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence contained in the administrative record, which comprises the entire body of evidence presented for consideration in connection with the project, and provides the basis to judge whether sufficient evidence supports the findings and decision of the agency. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515 (1974) (holding that a court "must scrutinize the record and determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency's findings and whether these findings support the agency's decision"). A governmental entity "must render findings sufficient both to enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review and, in the event of review, to apprise a reviewing court of the basis of the board's decision." Id. at 514.
Moreover, substantial evidence must support an administrative agency's findings and the findings must support the decision." Id. Here, there are insufficient facts to support the City's finding that the Project meets the applicable criteria for approval with regard to the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, and signage. Rather than approve the Project with the Conditions of Approval requiring the Applicant to submit further information, the City was obligated to delay approval until the requisite findings could be made. Accordingly, the City's approval was in error and must be reversed.

In light of the foregoing, we urge the City Council to reverse the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, deny the requested Project approvals, and acknowledge that the Project cannot be approved unless and until the City performs the required CEQA analysis and design review.

Re: December 3, 2019 Planning Commission Agenda Item No. 2: Amber Lane Apartments Design Review Application (DR 19-010)
Dear Chair Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission:
This office represents Discovery Builders, Inc., the applicant and a long time developer in the City of Brentwood. On the agenda for your meeting tonight is the proposed 288-unit Amber Lane Apartments project (the "Project"), with a recommendation for approval. For purposes of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq., the recommendation for approval appears to rely on the Environmental Impact Report (the "EIR") prepared for the PA-1 Specific Plan, which was adopted on November 13, 2018. For purposes of compliance with the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan ("HCP"), it appears conditions of approval are proposed to require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward but there does not appear to be a Planning Survey Report completed which is a requirement of the HCP. Also, nowhere in the Project approval documents is there a discussion or analysis on impacts to the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.

As discussed below, and among other issues, the environmental determination for the Project is inadequate to comply with CEQA, the Project itself is inconsistent with policies of the Specific Plan, and the lack of a Planning Survey Report is inconsistent with the City's HCP implementation ordinance.

1. The CEQA Determination is Inadequate
The staff report prepared for the Project (the "Staff Report") does not identify a specific exemption under CEQA that would serve as the basis for foregoing the preparation of any environmental document whatsoever. However, the Staff Report states that "It]he environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the [PA-1 Specific Plan] EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review," which suggests that the Project falls within the scope of the Specific Plan EIR. As you may know, on behalf of our client, we reviewed and submitted extensive comments on the EIR prepared for the PA-1 Specific Plan, and the general response

Page 2

at that time was that the EIR would provide streamlining benefits for future development within the specific plan area, based on project-specific environmental review for specific, proposed projects. Based on the Staff Report, no project specific environmental review or analysis has been conducted.

To the extent that the streamlining provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183, for projects a that are consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified, is relied upon, a determination as to whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site must be made based on an initial study or other analysis. (14 Cal. Code Regs., Sec. 15183.) Unless such a determination is made, any approval of the Project will not conform to the requirements of CEQA. Moreover, the Project appears inconsistent with the Specific Plan, including, as one example, Specific Plan Policy IF- 7.1 which requires a project applicant within the Specific Plan Area to coordinate with the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District in planning for adequate fire and emergency service. We do not see any conditions or mitigation or correspondence from East Contra Costa Fire Protection District outlining how adequate fair share contribution for fire and emergency service is being provided by the Project.
The record does not document the basis for any exemption or streamlining pursuant to CEQA. At a minimum, the grounds for the environmental determination, supporting facts, and the reasons the exceptions to the exemption do not apply must be identified. (See Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106 [the agency invoking the exemption has the burden of demonstrating it applies].) The factual support for an exemption determination "Ils all the more important where the record shows, as it does here, that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts.' (ld. at 117.)

2. The Project Does Not Comply With the City's HCP Implementation Ordinance

With regard to the Project's compliance with the HCP, the Staff Report states the following:
The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat or species are found during
pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.
This is inconsistent with Brentwood Municipal Code Section 16.168.050. For every application for development, a standard Planning Survey Report (PSR) is completed. The Code Section establishes HCP/NCCP take authorization application procedures and unequivocally mandates the following:

16071297.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood

A. The city shall require project applicants for any and all affected development projects to submit an application for take authorization to the director for review simultaneously
with the submittal of the request for approval of a
development project. The director may require that the application be submitted using a standard application a form. At a minimum, the application for take authorization must include the following information to be determined complete:

.

2. One or more reports documenting the methods and results of planning surveys and the methods of applicable preconstruction surveys and construction monitoring, in accordance with. Chapter 6 of the HCP/NCCP.

(Emphasis added.) Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request that complete environmental revlew of the proposed Project be conducted prior to its consideration for
approval,

Very truly yours, utunsQuero Kristina D. Lawson

Re: December 17, 2019 Planning Commission Agenda Item No. 3: Amber Lane Apartments Design Review Application (DR 19-010)
Dear Chair Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission:
We are writing to follow up on our letter dated December 3, 2019, a copy of which is attached hereto, relating to the proposed Amber Lane Apartments project (the "Project"), which is before you tonight with a recommendation for approval. As you kinow, the proposed Project includes the development of nine two- and three-story apartment buiidings for a total of 288 units, along with a 5,564 square-foot recreation building, and related amenities, including a pool and spa, community center, parking, trash enclosures, and landscaping.
Since December 3, 2019, we understand the draft conditions of approval were revised to address fire protection and emergency response service requirements, and we understand that a Planning Survey Report was previously completed in accordance with Section 16.168.050 of the Brentwood Municipal Code. However, concerns regarding the lack of any project-specific environmental review to support reliance on the Priority Area One Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report adopted on November 13, 2018 (the "Specific Plan EIR") for approval, and the lack of compliance with the City's application processing requirements remain unaddressed.
As discussed in detail below, the Project cannot be approved because (1) the lack of project- specific environmental review and deferral of mitigation measures render the City's environmental determination inadequate and (2) the required design review findings cannot be made and the processing of the Project's design review application does not conform with the
City's Code requirements.

1. The Environmental Determination for the Project is Unsupported and Inadequate
For purposes of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the recommendation for approval appears to rely on the program-level Specific Plan EIR. For projects that are consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified, a determination as to whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site must be made based on an initial study or other analysis. (14 Cal. Code Regs., Sec. 15183.)

For the reasons below, the City cannot rely on the Specific Plan EIR without conducting any
project-level analysis.

a. A Project Specific Analysis Has Not Been Undertaken as Reguired by
CEQA, the PA-1 Specific Plan, and the Specific Plan EIR.

* CEQA. In order to determine whether a program EIR is sufficient to approval a subsequent project, a lead agency must engage in a project-level analysis. The agency must first consider whether the project falls within the scope of the program EIR by determining whether it will result in environmental effects that were not examined in the EIR. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c).) If it is found that the project would have environmental effects that were not examined in the program EIR, the lead agency must prepare an initial study to determine the appropriate environmental document to address those effects. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(1).)
If the lead agency determines the activity is covered by the program EIR, it must then consider whether any new environmental effects could occur, or new mitigation measures would be required. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(2).) To do so, the agency considers whether any of the circumstances listed CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 trigger the need for further CEQA review. Such triggering circumstances are generally (1) changes in the project or in the circumstances under which it is undertaken that require evaluation of new significant environmental effects and (2) the availability of new information relating to significant effects or mitigation measures that was not known and could not have been known when the previous EIR was prepared. (14 Cal Code Regs §15162.)
If no new significant effects could occur and no new mitigation measures are necessary, it can approve the activity as being within the scope of the project covered by the program EIR, and no additional environmental document is required. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(2).) If, however, the agency determines that new environmental impacts could occur, or new mitigation measures would be required, further environmental review would be required. To the extent the City proposes to rely on an exemption under CEQA, it must still consider whether subsequent or supplemental review is required. (Gov. Code Sec. 65457.)

il. The PA-1 Specific Plan. The Specific Plan also contemplates project-level review, and provides that when future development applications within the Specific Plan area are received by the City, these projects will be reviewed for consistency with the specific plan. For projects that are found to be consistent with scope of activities analyzed in the EIR prepared for the Specific Plan, and which properly implement all relevant policies and
actions contained in the General Plan, additional project-specific CEQA analysis is intended to be streamlined. Future projects within the Specific Plan area would be subject to other City procedures such as those related to design and site development review, and conditional use permits. (Specific Plan, p. 10-15.) As discussed in detail below, the Project does not implement,
and is therefore inconsistent with, the applicable General Plan policies. A finding of consistency requires more than the generalized conclusion that the Project involves a permitted residential use type and falls within the permitted density range under the PA-1 Specific Plan.

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019
Page 3

ili. The Specific Plan EIR. The Specific Plan EIR states that its program-level analysis considers the broad environmental effects of the proposed.PA-1 Specific Plan to allow comprehensive consideration of the reasonably anticipated scope of future development within the Plan area but that "not all aspects of the future development are known at this stage in the planning process, as there are no specific development applications currently pending within the Plan area." (Draft EIR, p. 1.0-2.) Thus, future development projects and activities within the Specific Plan Area that require further discretionary approvals, including Site Plan and Design Review, will be examined in light of the EIR and in terms of consistency with the PA-1 Specific Plan, to determine whether additional environmental documentation must be prepared.

b. The Environmental Determination Contained in the Staff Report is Not Supported By Any Evidence
The Environmental Determination described in the staff report prepared for the Project relies on the Specific Plan EIR to conclude that no environmental review is required, without any analysis. The environmental determination states the following:
The environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the [Specific Plan] EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review. However, as identified in the EIR noise chapter, any future development within the plan area is required to obtain a noise study. As such, Veneklasen Associates prepared a noise study for the proposed Amber Lane Apartment development project, and concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. Any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant.

The PA-1 EIR identified several potentially-significant impacts; however, mitigation measures are incorporated to reduce those impacts to less than significant levels. All mitigation measures in the EIR and noise report not addressed by the standard conditions of approval are included as project-specific conditions of approval. No further environmental review is required at this time.
is The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of
approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat 0! species are found during pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019
Page 4

mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.

(Staff Report, pp. 2-3.) Again, a determination of project-level consistency requires a close examination of the Project's compliance with policies set forth in the PA-1 Specific Plan, which has not been undertaken.

C. The Project is Not Consistent with the Specific Plan
Instead of requiring project-level compliance with the policies set forth in the Specific Plan EIR as necessary to demonstrate that the Project falls within the scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan and EIR, the consistency requirements appear to be deferred as conditions of approval in some instances and ignored altogether in others.
For example, in the area of Geology and Soils, the Draft EIR states that as future development projects are considered by the City, each project will be evaluated for conformance with City standards and policies, and would also be analyzed for potential environmental impacts, consistent with the requirements of CEQA. (Draft EIR, p. 3.6-20.) Among the policies with which future projects within the Specific Plan area must be consistent is General Plan Action SA 1a, which requires "the submission of geologic and soils reports for all new developments. The geologic risk areas that are determined from these studies shall have standards established and recommendations shall be incorporated into development." (Draft EIR, pp. 3.6-17 and 3.6-18.) Here, there is no evidence that such studies have been submitted and there are no standards incorporated it the conditions of approval.
Similarly, in terms of stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge, the Draft EIR states that subsequent development projects proposed within the Specific Plan Area, such as residential projects, would result in new impervious surfaces and could reduce stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge. Due to the variation in infiltration rates based on the overlying soil types, "It]he City must evaluate individual projects as they are proposed to ensure that they would .not result in a significant interference with recharge. (Impact 3.9-2, Draft EIR, p. 3.9-17.) This evaluation has not been done.

With regard to flooding, subsequent development projects proposed within the PA-1 Plan area are required to implement General Plan policies and actions to ensure that implementation of the proposed PA-1 Specific Plan would have a less than significant impact related to these issues. Among the General Plan policies identified in the Draft EIR is General Plan Policy SA 2- 2, which is to require "all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site, treated, and/or conveyed to the nearest drainage facility as part-of- the development review process. Project applicants shall demonstrate that project implementation would not result in increases in the peak flow runoff to adjacent lands or drainage facilities that would exceed the design capacity of the drainage facility or result in an increased potential for off-site flooding.' (Draft EIR, p. 3.9-19.)
Instead of evaluating the proposed Project for consistency and compliance with this policy, the draft Conditions of Approval improperly defer the analysis. Condition of Approval No. 14 requires prior to issuance of a grading permit or of any grading and/or demolition work, identification of any special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood, and hydrology

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019
Page 5

and hydraulic calculations signed by licensed engineer demonstrating that the Project will adequately collect and convey all runoff within the Project as well as the entire developed watershed upstream and/or from upstream neighboring properties. Condition of Approval No. 14 states that the Permittee shall be responsible for mitigating the natural stormwater run-off from adjoining properties to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.

d. New Noise Mitigation Measures May Trigger Requirement for Subsequent Environmental Review
New mitigation measures relating to noise impacts may be required, which would trigger further environmental review under CEQA Guidelines Section 15162. The Staff Report indicates a noise study was prepared for the Project, and that it concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. The Staff Report further states that any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant. Neither the study nor the requirements of the report are provided or incorporated in the conditions of approval-Condition of Approval No. 12.c. requires compliance with the City's noise regulations, and draft Condition of Approval No. 13.i requires a detailed noise analysis to ensure compliance with all applicable noise requirements, and provide any Project-specific recommendations subject to the review and approval of the City.

e, Incorporation by Reference to the Specific Plan EIR MMRP Constitutes Impermissible Deferred Mitigation
Draft Condition of Approval No. 4 requires the Permittee to "comply with all applicable Mitigation Measures identified in the PA-1 Specific Plan Mitigation and Monitoring Program (MMRP) as prepared in conjunction with the EIR." The implementation of mitigation measures cannot be delayed beyond the start of the project activity that causes the impact in question. (POET, LLC V State Air Resources Bd. (2013) 218 CA4th 681, 740.) Based on this standard, the incorporation by reference to the range of mitigation measures identified in the Specific Plan MMRP results in the impermissible deferral of mitigation measures because the impacts to be mitigated would be caused by the start of the Project activity.
As one example, Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 states that future project proponent(s) must conduct preconstruction surveys to avoid or minimize the impacts on special-status species." Similarly, Mitigation Measure 3.4-2, 3.4-4, 3.4-7, 3.4-8, and 3.4-11 require preconstruction studies or surveys. There is no evidence that these surveys, studies, or analyses have occurred or that concrete plans are in place to ensure timely compliance with these specific plan EIR requirements. In short, approving the Project prior to satisfying the requirements set forth in the MMRP for specific projects, impermissibly defer multiple mitigation measures required by the specific plan EIR and would therefore violate CEQA. While a noise study was apparently prepared as required by Mitigation Measure 3.11-2, the study does not appear in the record and s only one of several surveys and studies that cannot be further deferred.

2. The Findings Required for Site Development Design Review Approval Cannot be Made

Findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence contained in the administrative record, which comprises the entire body of evidence presented for consideration in connection with the project, and provides the basis to judge whether sufficient evidence supports the findings and decision of the agency. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515). A governmental entity "must render findings sufficient both to enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review and, in the event of review, to apprise a reviewing court of the basis of the • board's decision." (ld. at 514.) Substantial evidence must support an administrative agency's findings and the findings must support the decision." (Id.) The findings must "bridge the analytical gap" between the evidence and the decision. (Id. at 521.) Here, there are no facts to support that the Project meets the applicable criteria for approval.
The draft Resolution No. 19-038 to approve the Design Review application purports to make the following findings associated with the site development criteria set forth Section 17.820.008 of the Brentwood Municipal Code:
A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilities on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and loading facilities, lighting, signing and access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.
B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or traffic.
Specifically, in support of these findings, the Staff Report states the following, despite the fact that detailed design plans have not been provided and are required as conditions of approval:
The siting and internal arrangement of the structure and circulation, parking and loading, lighting, access, landscape, hardscape, signing, and utility facilities on the site are conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient, and harmonious development insomuch as the buildings are is designed in such a way as to provide an attractive and interesting street scene from Amber Lane and Shady Willow Lane. The building is designed to reduce massing and introduce development on a scale that is appropriate and consistent with the PA-1 Specific Plan with hardscape and landscaping to provide an attractive development. Additionally, as designed, the Project will not have an adverse environmental effect on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use in that the proposed development adheres to the established PA-1 Specific Plan land use designation of High Density Residential. Conflicts relating to topography are avoided,

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019
Page 7

given the flat topography of both the subject site, as well as adjacent properties. Finally, traffic conflicts are avoided with the provision of roadway improvements for Amber Lane and Shady Willow.

However, the submittal of detailed designs for key design components of the Project, including the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, signage, have yet to be submitted. As explained in the Staff Report, "elevations, materials and design of the carport is not depicted in the project plans, and staff included a draft condition of approval requiring the design of the carports to be brought before the Design Review Subcommittee to ensure consistency with the rest of the complex." (Staff Report, p. 3; draft Conditions of Approval Nos. 6-9.) A draft condition of approval also requires the submittal of detailed landscape and irrigation plans for review and approval prior to the issuance of a building permit in order to ensure that all plantings will be in compliance with the City's Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. (Id.) As conditioned, all external building-mounted light fixtures and parking lot standards are to be of either a cut off or full-cut off design in order to ensure that light is cast downward and into the site instead of being allowed to extend onto surrounding properties, in conformance with the Specific Plan. It is not possible to make the required findings because there is no evidence to support them.
Further, with regard to signage, the Staff Report indicates that the proposed three monument entry signs is not consistent with the City's Municipal Code In that it exceeds the maximum number of freestanding signs per parcel. Yet, instead of requiring compliance prior to any approval, a draft condition of approval requires a modification of this signage for compliance with the municipal code. In addition, the condition requires the installation of directory signage for the site, as required by the Specific Plan pursuant to an administrative sign permit application with detailed plans and specification for review and approval by the Community Development Department. We note that the lack of the directory signage is yet another example of the Project's, inconsistency with the PA-1 Specific Plan.
Finally, the separate consideration of each of these permits and approvals required for the Project, the application Lot Merger merging the three parcels that comprise the site violates the requirement of Code Section 17.820.006, which states that the architectural review committee "shall review and act on architectural plans concurrently with any other land use permit or entitlement application submitted to the city, such as a conditional use permit or tentative parcel or tract map.' The separate processing and consideration of the required approvals also potentially result in improper piecemealing under CEQA.
Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request that you defer further consideration of the Project until such time as complete application materials consistent with the Code and PA-1 Specific Plan are submitted and project-specific environmental review has been completed.
Very truly yours,
Robia Crisp

Re: 1 Priority Area 1 Specific Plan Draft EIR

Dear Mr. Nolthenius:

This office represents Discovery Builders, Inc., the owner and developer of the Bridle Gate residential development project located immediately south of the proposed Priority Area 1 Specific Plan ("Specific Plan" or "Project") area and directly connected by way of an extension of Bridle Gate Drive. On behalf of our client, we have reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Report dated June 2018 and prepared for the Specific Plan (the "DEIR"), including the Traffic Data included as Appendix D to the DEIR ("Traffic Study"'). We submit the following comments for your consideration, primarily relating to the adequacy of the DEIR's identification and evaluation of the Project's potential impacts in the area of Transportation and Circulation, including the Project's potential impacts on the roadways and intersections within the Bridle Gate project area. The DEIR must be revised to take into account the traffic that will be directed south to the Bridle Gate project area.
To provide context, the Specific Plan area is generally bounded by Lone Tree Way to the north, Shady Willow Lane to the east, Sand Creek to the south, and Heidorn Ranch Road to the west. The Specific Plan area is bisected by State Route 4, described in the DEIR as the most heavily- travelled highway corridor in Brentwood. The DEIR indicates that the full buildout of the Specific Plan Area could accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population of 4,569 persons and up to 3,834,086 square feet of non-residential uses for a maximum non- residential population of 8,383 employees. (DEIR, p. 2.0-7.)
The Bridle Gate Project is mixed-use project located immediately south of Sand Creek Road, and west of State Route 4. An alignment of Bridle Gate Drive that will extend north from Sand Creek Road to Old Sand Creek Road and parallel to State Route 4, bisects the commercial portion of the Bridle Gate project site and directly connects the project to the southwestern portion of the proposed Specific Plan area north of Sand Creek Road.
Despite the increased traffic volumes that will be generated by the Project and the connectivity in the circulation network, the DEIR does not consider the Project's impacts on roadways and intersections to the south of the Project area, including the intersection at Sand Creek Road and North Gate Drive/Bridle Gate Road, for the purposes of its Transportation and Circulation analysis.

While the Transportation and Circulation Section of the DEIR describes the Future Plus Project scenario identifies the completion of circulation projects, including the construction of Bridle Gate Drive from the southern boundary of the Specific Plan Area to San Jose Avenue, the intersection and freeway operational analysis, as well as the vehicle miles traveled metrics fails to take into account the Project-generated traffic that will impact the intersection within the Bridle Gate Project area. (See DEIR, p. 3.14-32.) The a EIR should, at a minimum, include as a study intersection, the intersection at Sand Creek Road and Bridle Gate Road and this should include an analysis of proportional cost sharing for the bridge that will need to be built across Sand Creek. It should also include an analysis of other intersections within the Bridle Gate project that will be impacted. There should also be an analysis of the impacts to Sand Creek Road, a requirement for cost sharing, including the Sand Creek Road bridge to provide access to Antioch.

The EIR must identify the Project's impacts to this intersection, and other intersections and where potentially significant impacts are identified, propose and describe mitigation measures designed to minimize, reduce or avoid each identified potentially significant impact whenever it is feasible to do so. (CEQA Sec. 21002.1(b); 14 Cal.Code Regs., Sec. 15126.4.) We would note that the traffic study for the Bridle Gate project did not anticipate and therefore did not analyze the traffic that would be generated to the north of the project onto Bridle Gate Road (referred in the Bridle Gate traffic study as North Gate Road). It assigned no outside traffic to this connector to the north.

While the inadequacies of the analyses are most pronounced in the Transportation and Circulation section of the DEIR, other sections, including the Project Description and Cumulative Impacts analysis, should be reviewed and revised to take into account the development of the Bridle Gate project. For example, the Surrounding Land Uses included in the Project Description merely state that adjoining lands to the south of the Specific Plan Area are designated for GC, P, R-LD, SCH, and Permanent Open Space (P-OS) uses, and should be revised to incorporate accurate information regarding the Bridle Gate Project.(DEIR, p. 2.0-5.)
In addition, the DEIR fails to take into consideration the Bridle Gate project in evaluating whether any cumulative impacts may be significant and if so, whether the Project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable, i.e., that the incremental effects of the Project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs., Sec. 15130.)
Without this additional information, the DEIR fails to provide sufficient, complete technical detail for the public to evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, fails to adequately mitigate potentially significant impacts, and fails to provide substantial evidence for its conclusions. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our comments and look forward to reviewing a revised document.

Very fruly yours, dudte fuusn

Re: November 13, 2018 City Council Meeting Agenda Item No. E.1: (1) Certification of an Environmental Impact Report; (2) Adoption of a General Plan amendment (GPA 18- 002); (3) Adoption of the Priority Area 1 Specific Plan (SPA 18-001); and (4) Adoption of a rezone (RZ 18-003) to implement the zoning text and map amendments within the 1 Priority Area 1 Specific Plan

Dear Honorable Mayor Taylor and Councilmembers:
This office represents West Coast Home Builders, Inc., the owner and developer of the Bridle Gate residential development project located immediately south of the proposed approximately 431-acre Priority Area I Specific Plan ("Specific Plan" or "Project") area. On behalf of our client, we have reviewed the staff report dated November 13, 2018, prepared for your consideration of the Project and associated Final Draft Environmental Impact Report dated August 2018 (the "FEIR"), which the Planning Commission has recommended for certification.
We previously submitted a comment letter dated July 27, 2018 on the Draft EIR, as well as a letter to the Planning Commission dated October 16, 2018 relating to the adequacy of the FEIR, and a copy of which is included in the agenda packet for tonight's meeting. For the reasons described in detail in our prior correspondence, and largely ignored in both the Responses to Comments in the FEIR and the Staff Report, the FEIR does not satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") and must be revised and recirculated.

Under the PA-1 Specific Plan, the area will accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population of 4,569 persons and up to 3,834,086 square feet of non- residential uses for a maximum non-residential population of 8,383 employees. Remarkably, the FEIR concludes that impacts will be less than significant and require no mitigation in the areas of Aesthetics, Air Quality, Geology and Soils, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Land Use and Planning, Population and Housing, Public Services and Recreation, and Utilities and Service Systems, without any environmental analysis. Moreover, the conclusions in the FEIR, including the Responses to Comments, are unsupported by specific references to empirical information, scientific authorities, or explanatory information. Among the deficiencies of the FEIR are the following:

Fails to identify the gas and power transmission lines that transect the site in its discussion of Hazards and Hazardous Materials.

Ignores the fact that students within the development area immediately west of the Project site and within the City of Antioch, will attend BUSD schools along with students within the Specific Plan Area, and contains no information regarding the proposed school site at Bridle Gate for which the City has been preparing a separate environmental document.

Defers analysis of water quality impacts by calling for policies to require discretionary projects to integrate best management practices and natural features to the greatest extent feasible.

Fails to confirm in its discussion of Biological Resources, whether a Planning Survey Report has been prepared for the Project as required by the City's ordinance implementing the Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan Program.

Fails to discuss or consider new information regarding the presence of abandoned oil and gas wells and facilities.

• In the area of Transportation and Traffic:

O Fails to adequately consider the increased traffic volumes that will be generated by the Project given the connectivity in the circulation network, particularly the Project's impacts on roadways and intersections to the south of the Project area. In particular the FEIR fails to adequately account for and consider traffic through the proposed commercial area to the school site within the Bridle Gate project area, for which the City has already undertaken separate environmental review, and fails to study intersections within the Bridle Gate project that will be impacted by the Project.

O Fails to incorporate mitigation measures requiring fair-share contribution to a
mitigation fund that is part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the City commits itself to implementing, as required under CEQA.

O Fails to provide adequate mitigation for impacts that will foreseeably result from cumulative conditions..

o Ignores the request of the California Department of Transportation for an analysis of the intersections at the Lone Tree Way/SR 4 South Ramps (#9) and Lone Tree Way/SR 4 North Ramp-Jeffrey Way (#10) that demonstrate that impacts will be fully mitigated.
Was not properly submitted to ABAG for review and comment as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15206 for projects deemed to be of statewide, regional, or area-wide significance.

Despite the extensive comments, concerns and new information raised in our letters (and supported by comments on the DEIR submitted by the California Department of Transportation and the State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources), the Staff Report provides no discussion of these issues. Instead, the Staff Report summarily states that "the Planning Commission considered the comments made and correspondence received and then deliberated" prior to adopting resolutions recommending certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project. For purposes of your consideration, the Staff Report simply concludes, without discussion, that no new significant environmental impacts or issues, beyond those already covered in the Draft EIR for the PA-1 Specific Plan, were raised during the comment period for the DEIR.
The City continues to improperly defer conducting the level of environmental review required by CEQA by preparing a program EIR for the Specific Plan that purports to tier from the program EIR for the General Plan Update, neither of which EIRs provide the requisite analysis of potential impacts.

Accordingly, we request that you direct Staff to revise and recirculate the EIR to address the deficiencies outlined above and described in our prior correspondence.
Very truly yours,
Uuroundaeno

Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), allege as follows:

INTRODUCTION

l. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the decision by the City of Brentwood and Suite 200 26| its City Council (collectively "City") to approve a development application for the Amber Lane
27| Apartments Project ("Project"). Specifically, Petitioners allege that the City's actions in {
38349\13076929.6 28| approving the Project violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and its
Farella Braun + Martel LUP 2.35 M.mgtsmnery Sircet, 17" Rocr San Fraucian, Californin 44104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF [415) 954 441X)

1 implementing Guidelines because the City failed to undertake any project-specific CEQA review

2 of the Project. Rather than undertake the required CEQA review, the City adopted the
3 unsupported position that the Project is "exempt" under Section 15183 of the CEQA Guidelines

4 because the Project supposedly would be consistent with the general land use designation of the
5 PA-1 Specific Plan Area for which the City previously prepared a program Environmental Impact
6 Report. However, the City has made a fundamental error. This program level EIR specifically

7 contemplated that particular projects within the specific plan area would require project-specific

8 CEQA review. Indeed, such CEQA review was mandatory here because even the cursory Project
9 environmental information developed by the City demonstrated that the Project potentially could
10 or would have a wide range of significant project- and site-specific environmental effects.

11 2. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
12 required by CEQA by its improper decision not to conduct any formal CEQA review of the
13 Amber Lane Apartments Project prior to its approval. This decision could have far-reaching
14 adverse environmental impacts on adjacent developments, such as Petitioners' Bridle Gate
15 Project. When Petitioners commented on the lack of projcct- and site-specific details in the EIR
16 for the PA-1 Specific Plan Area, the City indicated (and the EIR provided) that such impacts
17 would be robustly evaluated under CEQA when specific projects were proposed. However, now
18 that a specific project has been proposed, the City flip-flops and asserts that all such impacts are
19 already encompassed within the program level EIR analysis for this Area. This approach
20 essentially means that the Project has illegally evaded any project specific CEQA review. To
21 make matters worse, the City has illegally deferred evaluation and identification of mitigation for
22 these environmental impacts.

23 3. The City's design review approval itself also violated governing law. Contrary to
24 the requirements of the City's Municipal Code, the City did not receive detailed design plans for
25 key design components of the Project, including landscape plans for street frontage landscape
26 areas and exterior lighting. Moreover, one critical portion of the design review analysis under the
27 Municipal Code is that "[t]he proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects
28  on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or

1 traffic." Although the approving resolution generally states without any support that this criterion
2 has been met, 10 substantial evidence supports this finding. The City attempted at the last minute
3 to address this important deficiency with conditions of approval requiring the applicant to submit
4 further information at a later time. However, the City committed reversible errors by not
5 obtaining the necessary information and not making supported factual findings before making the
6 Project approval decision. Accordingly, the City's approval was in error and must be vacated.

(415)954-4400

1 STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

2 14. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in the City's full and
3 complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in granting discretionary

4 approvals for the Project.

5 15. The City owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authority
6 under CEQA before exercising its discretion to approve the Project.

7 16. Petitioners have developed and are planning to develop multiple properties within
8 the City. One such development is the Bridle Gate Project, which is a residential development
9 project that is located immediately south and southwest of the Priority Area 1 Specific Plan Area
10 ("SP Area") within which the Amber Lane Apartments Project would be located. Petitioners have
11 an important interest in ensuring that all of the environmental impacts of the Project are identified
12 and fully mitigated, including environmental impacts that may or could affect Petitioners' nearby
13 development projects.

14 17. Petitioners took an active role in providing written comments on the program level
15 Environmental Impact Report for the PA-1 Specific Plan Arca within which the Project would be
16 sited, due to Petitioners' concerns about the potential environmental effects of projects within this
17 Area on their nearby development projects.

18 18. Petitioners filed written comments objecting to approval of the Project at the
19| public hearings held by the Brentwood Planning Commission, and Petitioners filed written
20 comments and provided oral testimony opposing approval of the Project on appeal to the City
21 Council, as further alleged herein.

22 19. Petitioners also have public interest standing to enforce the laws violated by the
23 City, including CEQA.

24 20. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
25 and will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relicf requested in this Petition.

26 NOTICE OF LAWSUIT

27 21. On February 25, 2020, Petitioners sent by mail, overnight delivery and email
28 letter to the Brentwood City Clerk and Brentwood City Council, giving notice to the City of

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
10 Amber Lane Apartments Project Approval Process
11 24. On August 8, 2019, Real Party in Interest Tekin & Associates, LLC submitted an
12 application with the City of Brentwood, requesting approval of a design review application (DR
13 No. 19-010) for the development of a 288-unit apartment complex and community center on three
14 adjacent parcels of undeveloped land within the PA-1 Specific Plan Area.

15 25. On September 6, 2019, the City informed Tekin that the application was
16| incomplete and that additional information was required. Following Tekin's resubmittal on
17 October 4, 2019, the Project was once again deemed incomplete in an October 10, 2019 letter
18 from the City.

19 26. The Project application was eventually deemed complete and was scheduled for a
20 public hearing on the agenda of the Brentwood Planning Commission meeting on December 3,
21 2019. On Dccember 3, 2019, Petitioner Discovery, through its attorneys, submitted a letter to the
22 Planning Commission objecting to approval of the Project, identifying a number of inadequacies
23 in the Planning Commission's review, including the omission of any provisions relating to
24  impacts on fire and emergency services and the lack of project-specific CEQA review.

25 27. At this Planning Commission meeting, the City Planning Manager informed the
26 Planning Commission that Discovery's letter raised issues requiring staff review and requested
27 that the matter be continued.

28 28. The Project was rescheduled for consideration at the Planning Commission

(415) 951-1400

1 meeting set on December 17, 2019. Petitioner Discovery, through its attorneys, submitted a letter
2 dated December 17, 2019 to the Planning Commission in which it opposed the Project approval

3 because of inadequacies in the City's CEQA analysis and design review. Nevertheless, the
4 Brentwood Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 19-038 approving the Project by a 3-1

5 vote at the December 17, 2019 meeting.

6 29. On December 20, 2019, Petitioner Discovery timely filed a written appeal to the

7 Brentwood City Council of the Planning Commission's decision approving the Project. In this
appeal, Discovery challenged both the Planning Commission's inadequate CEQA review and its

9 improper design review approval decision.

10 30. The City scheduled a public hearing of the appeal of the Planning Commission's
11 approval of the Project before the City Council for its January 28, 2020 meeting. Pursuant to the
12 Brentwood Municipal Code, the City Council was required to perform a de novo review of the
13 Planning Commission's decision. Municipal Code § 17.880.030(E).
14 31. On or about January 24, 2020, City Staff posted the agenda packet for the Project
15 appeal, which included a short staff response to the appeal and a new document purporting to be
16 an "environmental analysis" for the Project. This environmental analysis, which was not dated,
17 appears to have been produced after the Planning Commission decision, in response to the filing'

18 of Discovery's appeal.

19 32. Before the City Council meeting, Petitioners, through their attorneys, submitted to
20 the City a detailed comment letter dated January 28, 2020 in which they opposed approval of the
21 Project, both because the CEQA review is inadequate and the design review approval is improper.
22 A true and correct copy of this letter is enclosed herewith as Exhibit "2" and incorporated herein
23 by refcrence. A representative of Petitioners and Petitioners' counsel also appeared and testified
24 at this City Council hearing in opposition to approval of the Project.

25 33. At its mecting on January 28, 2020, the City Council held a public hearing on
26 Petitioner Discovery's appeal of the Planning Commission decision on the Project development
27 approval. The City Council denied the appeal filed by Discovery and approved the application
28 for the Project by way of Resolution No. 2020-13. In this Resolution, the City affirmed its view

1 that"[n]o further environmental review is required at this time."

2 34. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the City has not
3 filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project approval under CEQA Guidelines Section 15062.
4 Priority Area 1 Specific Plan EIR

5 35. The City prepared an Environmental Impact Report for an approximately 431-acre

6 area within the City known as the Priority 1 Area Specific 1 Plan (*PA-1 Specific Plan") Area.
7 This Area will accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population of
8 4,569 persons and almost four million square feet of commercial space.

9 36. The Environmental Impact Report for the PA-I Specific Plan Area ("PA-1 EIR")
10 specifically acknowledges that it is a "program EIR." The PA-1 EIR acknowledges the
11 limitations on its future use under CEQA and specifically calls for project-specific environmental
12 analysis when particular developments within the PA-1 Specific Plan Area are proposed. Thus,
13 for example, a typical statement regarding particular environmental impacts in this EIR is: "based
14 upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed site-specific information
15 on this impact is not feasible." Draft EIR, p. 3.9-16. With regard to issues such as geology and
16 soils, the EIR specifically states that certain impacts "tend to be site-specific and project-
17 specific." Draft EIR, p. 4.0-10. Furthermore, public comments submitted on the Draft EIR
18 cxpressed concerns regarding the City's environmental analysis, including with regard to
19 potentially significant impacts relating to traffic and abandoned oil and gas wells and facilitics.
20 Final EIR, pp. 2.0-3 to 2.0-18.

21 37. Accordingly, the PA-1 EIR specifically contemplates that, to satisfy CEQA,
22 further project and sitc-specific CEQA review would need to occur for particular projects that
23 would be proposed for the PA-1 Specific Plan Arca.

24 38. On November 13, 2018, the City Council certified the Final PA-1 EIR and
25 approved other general plan, specific plan, and zoning amendments related to the PA-1 Specific
26 Plan.

27 California Environmental Quality Act Requirements

28 39. CEQA requires a government agency considering a discrctionary approval for a
38349\13076029.6 Farellal - Montef LLP 8 -
Montgoniery Street, 17" Floor San Frascisco, Colifornia 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
(415) 954-4400

1 development project to conduct environmental review of the project pursuant to CEQA's
2 provisions.

3 40. CEQA recognizes the concept of "tiering" of environmental review, although it
4 I prescribes specific requirements that must be met to perform this type of sequential environmental •

5 review. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "[t]iering is properly used to defer
6 analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases when the impacts 01

7 mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval decision but are specific to the
8 later phases." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova,

9 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007).

10 41. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 provides the requirements for environmental
11 review of specific projects undertaken pursuant to a program EIR. Since the PA-1 EIR is a
12|"program" EIR, the requirements of Section 15168 directly apply.
13 42. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c) provides that "[I]ater activities in the program
14  must be examined in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional
15 environmental document must be prepared." Specifically, "[i]f a later activity would have effects
16 that were not examined in the program EIR, a new initial study would need to be prepared
17. leading to either an EIR or a negative declaration." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(c)(1) (emphasis
18 added). Here, numerous individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Project were not

19 examined in the PA-1 EIR and therefore an Initial Study and either an EIR or Negative
20 Declaration are required.

21 43. In Exhibit B to Resolution No. 2020-13 approving the Project, the City Council
22 asserted for the first time that it was entitled to use CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 as an
23 exemption/streamlining provision for environmental review of the Project. While CEQA
24 Guidelines Section 15183 permits streamlined cnvironmental review of "projects which are
25 consistent with the development density established by existing zoning, community plan, or
26 general plan policies for which an EIR was certified," streamlining does not authorize subsequent
27  projects to evade project-specific CEQA environmental review. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. §
28 Such projects are subject to a rigorous set of CEQA requirements, including a determination of

235 Monigonery Sueet. 17* Floor
San Francisco, Califomia 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (415) 954.480

"whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site."

2 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(a).

44. Guidelines Section 15183 specifically references the use of an Initial Study to

4 evaluate whether any of the Project's environmental impacts:

5 (1) Are peculiar to the project or the parcel on which the project would be located,

6 (2) Were not analyzed as significant effects in a prior EIR on the zoning action, general plan or community plan with which the project is consistent, 7
(3) Are potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts which were
8 not discussed in the prior EIR prepared for the general plan, community plan or zoning action, or a (4) Are previously identified significant effects which, as a result of substantial new 10 information which was not known at the time the EIR was certified, are determined to have a more severe adverse impact than discussed in the prior EIR. 11

12 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(b) (emphasis added).

13 45. Furthermore, Section 15183 provides that "[t]his section does not affect any
14 requirement to analyze potentially significant offsite or cumulative impacts if those impacts were
15 not adequately discussed in the prior EIR." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(j). Because the Project
16 will have potentially significant offsite impacts that were not considered in the PA-1 Specific Plan
17 EIR, Section 15183 does not excuse the City's lack of project-spccific analysis.

18 46. In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 provides that when an EIR has been
19| certified, subscquent environmental review is required when:

20 New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous 21 EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the following: 22
(A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the 23 previous EIR or negative declaration;

24 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; 25
(C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact bc feasible and would substantially reduce one or more 26
significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt 27 the mitigation measure or alternative; or

28 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from

1 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one Or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to 2 adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.
3 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15162(a)(3).

4 47. The Project's environmental impacts required further CEQA review under CEQA
5 Guidelines Sections 15183 and 15162 prior to its approval by the City, particularly in light of the
6 PA-1 EIR's minimal and limited analysis of impacts. Thus, the City has failed to fulfill its
7 obligations under CEQA.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (CEQA Violations - Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)

10 48. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
11 contained in paragraphs 1 through 47 of this Petition.

12 49, It is undisputed that the City failed to perform any formal CEQA review for the
13 Project in connection with the discretionary decision of the City Council on January 28, 2020 to

14 deny Discovery's appeal and approve the Project design review in City Council Resolution No.
15 2020-13.

16 50. The City did not complete and circulate to the public an Initial Study for the
17 Project and did not prepare a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration or project
18 level EIR for the Project, before its approval of the Project.

19 51. The City's discretionary design review approval for the Project is subject to
20 CEQA. As such, the City was specifically required to determine at the outset whether the Project
21 iS exempt from CEQA. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15061(a). §

22 52. The Brentwood Planning Commission never made a determination whether the
23 Project was exempt from CEQA. Rather, in an environmental statement only three paragraphs
24 long in the December 17, 2019 Staff Report for the Planning Commission, City Staff generally
25 referred to the PA-1 EIR review of the site and asserted that "there is no ncw information or
26 substantial changes that require additional environmental review." On this wholly unsupported
27 basis, the Planning Commission found that no site-specific CEQA analysis was required.
28 53. It is undisputed that the PA-1 EIR did not conduct any environmental review of the

Farella Bramt -Montel LLP 11 - 38349\13076929.6
235 Montgomery Strcei, 17° Flcor San Francisco Califomia 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
(115; 954-4400

1 Amber Lane Apartments Project, which was first proposed to the City after the PA-1 EIR was

2 certified and the associated approvals for the PA-1 Specific Plan were adopted. Accordingly, the
3 PA-1 EIR only generally evaluated the properties within the 431-acre Specific Plan Area based on

4 assumptions regarding the type of development that would occur there. This type of "program"

5 level analysis did not include any Project-specific CEQA analysis.

6 54. On appeal, the City Council essentially came to the same unsupported conclusion

7 as the Planning Commission. In new "Exhibit B" attached to the proposed City Council
8 approval Resolution issued two business days before the City Council appeal hearing, the City

9 stated that a CEQA "exemption" in CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 applies to the Project. In
10 fact, this is mainly a "streamlining" provision that requires additional project-specific CEQA
11 review to be performed when "there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to
12 the project or its site." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(a).

13 55. The City concluded, on the basis of this informal environmental analysis prepared
14 just before the appeal hearing, that no project-specific CEQA environmental review was required
15 for the Project. This environmental analysis is no more than a document prepared after-the-fact as
16 a prohibited post-hoc rationalization to justify decisions already made, and it is not comparable to
17 the rigorous and empirical Initial Study requirements and public comment process prescribed in
18 CEQA.

19 56. In fact, the limited environmental information before the City Council
20 demonstrated that the Project potentially could or definitely would have significant environmental
21 effects, including potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts. These impacts
22 include, but are not limited to, traffic impacts, stormwater control impacts, drainage impacts,
23 geology and soils impacts, protected specics impacts, and noise impacts. All of these impacts will
24 | directly and adversely affect development projects near the Amber Lane Apartments Project,
25 including Petitioners' Bridle Gate Project.

26 57. The City violated CEQA, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed
27 in the manner required by CEQA by the following actions and inactions:

28 (A) The City failed to prepare an Initial Study under CEQA Guidelines Section

Farella Braun + Martel LLP 12 - 38349\13076929.6
235 Montgamery Suce, 17* Floo San Francisco, Coliforuin 94101 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
1415) 954-4400

1 15168(c)(1);

2 (B) The City failed to determine under CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 that the

3 Project's impacts are peculiar to the project or parcel on which the Project would be

4 located, and/or that the Project has potentially significant off-site impacts and

5 cumulative impacts that were not discussed in the PA-1 EIR, and/or that

6 substantial new information demonstrates that significant effects will a have a more

7 severe adverse impact, thereby requiring further CEQA review; and

8 (C) The City failed to determine that new information of substantial importance

9 regarding the Project within the meaning of CEQA Guidelines Section 15162

10 requires that a subsequent EIR or Negative Declaration be prepared for the Project.
11 Each of these CEQA violations, by itself, compels the Court to vacate the City's approval of the
12 Project.

13 58. The City also violated CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion by attempting
14 to avoid CEQA requirements by deferring CEQA environmental assessment and mitigation of
15 admitted significant effects of the Project by stating that there will be later studies to address these
16 impacts and identify mitigation. This approach is directly contrary to CEQA's requirement that
17 this analysis and formulation of appropriate mitigation measures must occur before the Project is
18 approved. See, e.g., California Native Plant Soc'y v. City of Ranch Cordova, 172 Cal. App. 4th
19 603, 621 (2009).
20 59. The City also violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The City
21 | improperly limited its CEQA findings only to effects that it deemed to be attributable to the
22 design review approval. Not only did the City draw an artificial and unsupportable distinction
23| between the types of environmental impacts that the Project would cause, but it failed to realize it
24 that its Municipal Code requires an analysis of potential adverse off-site impacts, including on
25 adjacent property developments. In addition, the City's findings do not provide adequate
26 reasoning or the requisite analysis that properly leads from facts to legal findings.
27 60. As a result of these CEQA inadequacies and others according to proof, the City
28 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to procced in the manner required by CEQA in

1 failing to conduct adequate CEQA environmental review for the Amber Lane Apartments Project.
2 The City's approval of the Project must therefore be set aside and vacated.

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violations of Brentwood Municipal Code Design Review - Chapter 17.820, et seq.)

6 61. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
7 contained in paragraphs 1 through 60 of this Petition.

8 62. In order to approve design review for the Project, the City purported to make the
9 requisite design review findings under Brentwood Municipal Code Section 17.820.008, which
10 provides:

11 The following criteria shall be applied in considering all applications for design and
12 site development review approval:
A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilities 13 on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and

14 loading facilities, lighting, signing and access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.

15 B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, 16 topography or traffic.

17 63. At the time of the City Council's approval, the detailed designs for key
18 components of the Project had yet to be submitted, including landscape plans for street frontage

19 landscape areas and exterior lighting. Furthermore, the City was aware that the Project's
20 proposed signage was inconsistent with Section 17.640.008 of the Municipal Code.

21 64. Moreover, the City's environmental analysis was inadequate to support a finding
22 that the Project would not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments. The
23 City performed inadequate analysis of environmental impacts, including but not limited to
24 drainage, stormwater control, noise, and traffic, all of which would have potentially significant
25 adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments.

26 65. The City attempted to circumvent its design review obligations through the
27  imposition of conditions of approval that require Real Party Tekin to complete and submit further
28 plans associated with the proposed Project. However, in order to make the required findings and
Farella Draun Manel LLP 14 - 38349\13076929.6
235 Mongonery Strect. 17ª Floor San Francico, California 94104 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
1415) 951-4400

1 properly approve Design Review for the Project, the City was obligated to obtain and review such
2 information prior to Project approval.

3 66. The City did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the Project meets the

4 applicable criteria for design review approval with regard to Project features and impacts such as

5 carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, signage, and
6 environmental impacts. Accordingly, the City's decision to approve design review for the Project
7 was not made on an adequate evidentiary basis in light of the applicable legal standard, which

8 requires that findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence
9 contained in the administrative record. See Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Cmty. V. Cty. of Los
10 Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515 a (1974) (holding that a court "must scrutinize the record and
11 determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency's findings and
12 whether these findings support the agency's decision").

13 67. Rather than approve the Project with conditions of approval requiring the
14 Applicant to submit further information, the City was required to deny approval of the Project or
15 to defer its consideration of the Project until the requisite findings could be made and project-
16 specific adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments could be analyzed.

17 68. As a result of these failures and others according to proof, the City prejudicially
18 abused its discretion in failing to conduct adequate design and associated environmental review
19 for the Amber Lane Apartments Project. Therefore, its approval of the Project must be set aside.
20 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as hereinafter set forth.
21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
23 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to set aside and vacate the

Re: Appeal of Amber Lane Apartments Project Approval City Council Agenda, January 28, 2020. Item No. D(1)
Dear Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council:
On behalf of Discovery Builders, Inc. and West Coast Home Builders, Inc. (collectively "Discovery"), we hereby present the legal grounds and reasons why the Brentwood City Council should reverse the Planning Commission decision and deny the design review application (DR- 10-010) and lot merger application for the Amber Lane Apartments Project (*Project"). Discovery is a longtime developer in the City of Brentwood ("City") and is in the process of developing a project in the immediate vicinity of the Amber Lane Project which would be directly impacted by the Project issues raised herein.

I. INTRODUCTION

On December 17, 2019, the Planning Commission, acting on the recommendation of City Staff, approved the 288-unit Project. Discovery filed written comments opposing the Project before and at the Planning Commission hearing. These letters are enclosed herewith as Exhibits "A" and "B," and are incorporated herein by reference. On December 20, 2019, Discovery filed a timely appeal to the Brentwood City Council ("City Council") of the Planning Commission decision approving the Project. A copy of this appeal (without attachments) is enclosed herewith as Exhibit "C" and is incorporated herein by reference.
As explained in detail below, the City has failed to comply with its obligations under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), in connection with its proposed approval of the Project, and is thereby barred from taking any action on the underlying Project approvals. The Project lies within the area covered by the City's PA-1 Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"). The City failed to perform adequate specific CEQA review in connection with the Planning Commission approvals. Rather, contrary to the clear legal requirements of CEQA, the City found that no further environmental review was

required, despite having an insufficient evidentiary basis for such a finding. Because the Planning Commission's cursory environmental review did little more than reference the program level Environmental Impact Report prepared for the Specific Plan (**Specific Plan EIR"), the City's approval of the Project failed to meet CEQA's clear requirements for a site-specific environmental analysis. The material included in the agenda packet for this City Council meeting does not change this conclusion in any respect.
Pursuant to the Brentwood Municipal Code, the City Council must perform a de novo review of the Planning Commission's decision. Municipal Code § 17.0880.030(E). Under the Municipal Code, the City Council is empowered to affirm, modify, or reverse that decision. Municipal Code § 17.880.030(F).
For these and other reasons, which are explained in more detail below, the City Council must reverse the Planning Commission's decision and deny the requested Project approvals. The Project cannot be approved unless and until the full analysis required by CEQA is performed.

II. BACKGROUND FACTS

On August 8, 2019, Tekin & Associates, LLC (*Applicant") submitted the Project application to the City of Brentwood, requesting approval of a design review application (DR 19- 010) for the development of a 288-unit apartment complex on three adjacent parcels of undeveloped land within the Specific Plan area. On September 6, 2019, the City informed the Applicant that the application was incomplete and that additional information was required. Following the Applicant's resubmittal on October 4, 2019, the Project was once again deemed incomplete in an October 10, 2019 letter from the City. On October 8, Tckin & Associates submitted a Lot Merger (LLA 19-008) application to the Public Works Engincering Division to merge three parcels, totaling 14.4 acres, into one parcel.
The Project application was eventually deemed complete and was slated to appear on the Planning Commission agenda for the meeting on December 3, 2019. On that day, Discovery's attorneys submitted a letter to the Planning Commission objecting to the approval, pointing out a number of inadequacies in the Planning Commission's review, including the omission of any provisions relating to impacts on fire and emergency services and lack of project-specific CEQA review. See Exhibit "A." At that night's Planning Commission meeting, Planning Manager Erik Nolthenius informed the Commission that the letter raised issues requiring staff review and requested that the matter be continued, Subsequently, Conditions of Approval were added that required the Applicant to address fire and emergency services impacts by paying a fire development impact fee and requesting that the Project site be annexed into a Community Facilities District. Nevertheless, the Project was quickly rescheduled for consideration at the December 17, 2019 Planning Commission meeting, where it was approved despite the submittal of an additional objection letter from Discovery's attorneys detailing the inadequacies of the City's CEQA analysis and design review. See Exhibit "B."
On January 24, 2020, City Staff posted the agenda packet for this City Council meeting, which included a short staff response to the appeal letter a and a document purporting to be an

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 3

"Environmental Analysis" for the Project. This Environmental Analysis, which was not dated, appears to have been produced after the Planning Commission decision, in response to Discovery's appeal letter. In this document, City Staff asserts, for the first time, that CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 was used to streamline the environmental review process. Although the Environmental Analysis attempts to discuss a variety of environmental issues, it does not document performance of the additional analysis called for in the Specific Plan EIR. Moreover, as explained in further detail below, the City should have, and did not, prepare a Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration under CEQA. Accordingly, the required CEQA analysis has not been done and the Project cannot be approved.
The Project's expedited timeline stands in stark contrast to the City's treatment of other development projects, many of which must go through years-long staff evaluations before being considered for approval by the Planning Commission. As evidenced by the omission of the fire and emergency services provisions-which would have gone completely unnoticed were it not for Discovery's letter--the City has been intent on rushing the Project through the approval process. Ultimately, the City's haste has allowed the Project to speed through without full and careful consideration of environmental impacts or design review.

III. THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT APPROVE THE PROJECT BECAUSE IT HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH ITS IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT OBLIGATIONS.

In order to safeguard against abuses of power, California public agencies are required to use their discretion in a manner that is objectively reasonable and supported by evidence. In evaluating public agency decisions, California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 holds that an agency has abused its discretion if its "findings are not supported by substantial cyidence in the light of the whole record." Furthermore, "[a] prejudicial abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, if its decision is not supported by findings, or if its findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record." Sierra Club V. Cly. of Napa, 121 Cal. App. 4th 1490, 1497 (2004).
Accordingly, California courts have described "two types of error which may constitute an abuse of discretion under CEQA." Save Panoche Valley v. San Benito Cty., 217 Cal. App. 4th 503, 514 (2013). First, "an agency may fail to proceed in the manner laid out under the CEQA

The sudden appearance of the new "Environmental Analysis" raises more questions than it answers. This document is undated and was not contained in the documents available to
the public and reviewed by the Planning Commission before 01 at the time it made its decision. It appcared publicly for the first time four days ago and appears to be a prohibited after-the-fact justification for the Planning Commission decision. According to City Staff, this document "further augments and provides additional substantial evidence to support staff's determination." To the contrary, it fails to meet the requirements of CEQA and certainly cannot be used to support the Planning Commission decision or provide any CEQA platform for a City Council decision.

regulations." Id. Second, "an agency may reach factual determinations under CEQA that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record." Id. In the CEQA context, "substantial evidence" means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." San Franciscans Upholding the Downtown Plan v. City & Cty. of San Francisco, 102 Cal. App. 4th 656, 675 (2002) (quoting 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15384).
Here, the Planning Commission clearly abused its discretion by approving the Project without performing the necessary project-specific environmental review under CEQA. As will be described further below, the City neglected and ignored the prescribed CEQA steps for utilizing CEQA streamlining processes and failed to perform the analysis required for site- specific review of a project undertaken in an area which has a programmatic EIR. Moreover, the City did not rely on any evidence whatsoever, let alone substantial evidence, in concluding that the Project will not have any potential environmental impacts that were not considered by the Specific Plan EIR. This is contrary to the clear mandate of California law, which requires that an agency's decision must be based on findings, and that such findings must be based on substantial evidence in light of the whole record. Sierra Club, supra, 121 Cal. App. 4th at 1497; Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.
To avoid abusing its discretion here, the City Council must reverse the Planning Commission's approval of the Project.

A. The Planning Commission Failed To Properly Identify Or Apply A CEQA Exemption Or Streamlining Provision Applicable To The Project.
Under CEQA, the first step a public agency must take is "to determine whether the proposed project is subject to CEQA review in the first instance.3 Berkeley Hillside Pres. v. City of Berkeley, 60 Cal. 4th 1086, 1099 (2015). Then, "[o]nce a lead agency has determined that an activity is a project subject to CEQA, a lead agency shall determine whether the project is exempt from CEQA." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15061(a).
Here, the City appeared to recognize that the Project is subject to CEQA review, although it never explicitly so stated. Regardless, it is absolutely clear that this Project is subject to CEQA. However, the City failed to perform the next step. Nowhere in any of the Project approval documents did the City indicate whether the Project is exempt from CEQA or, if so, which exemption supposedly applies. As California courts have recognized, "[t]he city's consideration of whether [an] exemption applies is itself an environmental review." Concerned Dublin
Citizens v. City of Dublin, 214 Cal. App. 4th 1301, 1317 (2013). Accordingly, "[an] agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." Davidon Homes v.
City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 117 (1997).
Here, there is insufficient evidence in the record to support the Planning Commission's environmental determination. While City Staff belatedly prepared a document purporting to support the application of Guidelines Section 15183 to the Project (which is "streamlining"

38349\3012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA

Page 5

provision, not a full exemption), there is no indication that this document informed the prior decision of the Planning Commission. Furthermore, this Environmental Analysis does not demonstrate that potential impacts of the project were sufficiently analyzed for purposes of the City Council decision. To the contrary, there are multiple potential environmental impacts that the City failed to adequately consider, as described further below.

B. The Planning Commission Failed To Adequately Consider Possible Project- Specific Environmental Impacts In Light Of The PA-1 Specific Plan.
The concept of performing sequential environmental review-often called "tiering"--has long been permitted under CEQA, so long as it is done properly. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "[t]iering is properly used to defer analysis of environmental impacts and mitigation measures to later phases when the impacts or mitigation measures are not determined by the first-tier approval decision but are specific to the later phases." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007). Using a prior EIR to streamline subsequent environmental review is intended to reduce redundant environmental review, not to permit subsequent projects to avoid individualized environmental review altogether. Rather, the benefit of tiering from a program EIR is that it "allows an agency to defer analysis of certain details of later phases of long-term linked or complex projects until those phases are up for approval." Id.
Here, the City did not properly perform the project-specific analysis that the PA-1 Specific Plan purposely deferred. The City relied entirely on the Specific Plan in finding that no environmental review of the Project was required. As described in the Staff Report before the Planning Commission, the entirety of the City's "environmental review" is as follows:
The City previously prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (State Clearinghouse No. 2018042064) in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the entire PA-1 Specific Plan
area. The environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review. However, as identified in the EIR
noise chapter, any future development within the plan area is required to obtain a noise study. As such, Veneklasen Associates prepared a noise study for the proposed Amber Lane Apartment development project, and concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. Any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will nced to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant.

The PA-1 EIR identified several potentially-significant impacts; however, mitigation measures are incorporated to reduce those impacts to less than significant levels. All mitigation measures in the EIR and noise report not addressed by the standard conditions of approval are included as project-specific conditions of approval. No further environmental review is required at this time.

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+ MARTEL LLP

Page 6

The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conseryation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre-
construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat or species are found during pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.

Staff Report, pp. 10-11 (emphasis added).

The thrust of the City's statement is that all necessary environmental review was performed in the Specific Plan EIR. However, rather than examining the Project in light of the analysis performed in the Specific Plan EIR, the City relies on a generalized conclusion regarding the Project's consistency with the Specific Plan. This unsupported and conjectural level of analysis is woefully insufficient to satisfy either CEQA or the requirements of the PA-1 Specific Plan itself.
CEQA requires that "[w]hen a program EIR is used to avoid preparing subsequent EIR's, such as here, the public agency must examine site-specific program activities 'in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional environmental document must be prepared." Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Dep't of Fish & Wildlife, 234 Cal. App. 4th 214, 238 (2015). Furthermore, as the Specific Plan EIR states, "[d]evelopment projects in the Specific Plan Arca that require further discretionary approvals will be examined in light of this EIR to determine whether additional environmental documentation must be prepared." Draft EIR ("DEIR"), p. ES-1. Here, the City did not perform adequate project-specific analyses, nor is there substantial evidence in the record to support the City's approval.

1. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168
CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 provides the specific requirements for environmental review of projects undertaken pursuant to a program EIR. The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR specifically acknowledges that it is a program EIR. DEIR, p. ES-1 ("This EIR has been prepared as a Program EIR pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15168."). Therefore, the requirements of Section 15168 directly apply.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c) provides that "[l]ater activities in the program must be examined in the light of the program EIR to determine whether an additional environmental document must be prepared." Specifically, "[i]f a later activity would have effects that were not examined in the program EIR, a new initial study would need to be prepared leading to either an

EIR or a negative declaration." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(c)(1) (emphasis added). Here, numerous effects of the Project were not examined in the Specific Plan EIR and therefore an initial study and either an EIR or negative declaration are required. See Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz, 131 Cal. App. 4th 1170, 1180 (2005) ("It is now well established, however, that an initial study is the preliminary environmentäl analysis and its purposes include proving the lead agency with information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an EIR or negative declaration, enabling an applicant or lead agency to modify a project, mitigating adverse impacts before an EIR is prepared, thereby enabling the project to qualify for a negative declaration, and providing documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment.") (internal alterations and quotations omitted). As described further below, the Project's effects include, but are not limited to, potential impacts relating to traffic, geology and soils, stormwater control, and
noise.

Although the Project site was considered for high density residential development, the record indicates that an insufficient project-specific analysis was performed. This runs contrary to CEQA's purpose and requirements with regard to the use of program EIRs. See Ctr. for Biological Diversity, supra, 234 Cal. App. 4th at 238. While the Specific Plan EIR addressed certain high-level impacts caused by residential developments in general, it did not, and did not purport to, analyze the particular environmental impacts discussed in Section III.C. Instead, the Specific Plan EIR deliberately deferred analysis of these potential impacts. By neglecting to perform this analysis, the City is avoiding completing the necessary environmental review.
Section 15168 also requires that "[w]here the later activities involve site specific operations, the agency should use a written checklist or similar device to document the
cvaluation of the site and the activity to determine whether the environmental effects of the operation were within the scope of the program EIR." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(c)(4). In this case, there is no evidence that the Planning Commission analyzed the site-specific impacts of the Project nor that it utilized a "written checklist or similar device" to document the analysis. Accordingly, the City failed to fulfill its obligations under CEQA with regard to approval of a later activity undertaken pursuant to a program EIR.
The newly created Environmental Analysis does not change this conclusion in any respect. It is not equivalent to an Initial Study because it does not contain the five boxes (or equivalent) for each environmental area to document whether there are significant impacts, whether they are less than significant due to mitigation, and whether this is mitigation addressed by uniformly applicable development policies. Rather, it appears to be no more than a non- scientific justification for decisions already made. Rather, the analyses contained therein require the preparation of at least a Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration, with circulation for public review and comment.

2. PA-1 Specific Plan EIR
By failing to perform adequate project-specific analysis, the City ignored the commands of the PA-1 Specific Plan that it purports to rely upon. Throughout the Specific Plan EIR, that

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 8

document acknowledges its shortcomings and specifically calls for project-specific environmental analysis. For example, the Specific Plan EIR states in numerous instances that "[b]ased upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed, site-specific information on this impact is not feasible." E.g., DEIR, p. 3.9-16. Such statements are not invitations to ignore environmental review of such impacts, but instead indicate that project- specific analysis is required. See DEIR, p. 3.9-16 ("However, each future project must include detailed project specific drainage plans that control storm water runoff and erosion, both during and after construction.").
City Staff improperly believes that no further project-specific analysis is necessary. In the sentence describing the Project analysis in light of the Specific Plan EIR, the Planning Commission decision asserts: "[t]he environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site were analyzed in the EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review." Resolution No. 19-038 at 1. This statement reflects a
basic misunderstanding of the role played by the Specific Plan EIR in the environmental review process. Where : project is undertaken pursuant to a program EIR, project-specific information relating to the subsequent project warrants individual analysis. See Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles, 103 Cal. App. 4th 268, 284-85 (2002) (rejecting city's approval of project pursuant to prior programmatic EIR where city performed insufficient project-specific analysis). This is particularly true in cases where, as here, the program EIR did not identify or analyze the subsequent project whatsocver. Perhaps the City is improperly confusing its obligations for site- specific analysis with the provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15162, which requires a previously certified EIR to be supplemented when certain significant new information arises. Regardless, the City cannot point to the Specific Plan EIR for analysis that the EIR did not
perform.

Nor can the City simply defer all environmental analysis through the imposition of conditions of approval. Sundstrom v. Cty. of Mendocino, 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307 (1988) ("By deferring environmental assessment to a future date, the conditions run counter to that policy of CEQA which requires environmental review at the carliest feasible stage in the planning process."). This is because "[t]he determination of whether a project will have significant environmental impacts, and the formulation of measures to mitigate those impacts, must occur before the project is approved." California Native Plant Soc'y v. City of Rancho Cordova, 172 Cal. App. 4th 603, 621 (2009). Here, the City evidently assumed that the mitigation measures identified in the Specific Plan EIR are sufficient to render all potential impacts of the Project insignificant, despite neglecting to assess project-specific impacts not considered in the Specific Plan EIR. Furthermore, the generalized Conditions of Approval requiring the Project to
comply with various provisions of the Municipal Code relating to environmental impacts do not constitute CEQA mitigation measures for project-specific impacts.
Quite simply, the Planning Commission improperly approved the Project before it determined whether there were any project-specific impacts that were potentially significant. Accordingly, it can neither rely on the Specific Plan EIR's more general mitigation measures nor defer project-specific mitigation measures until later analysis. See Rialto Citizens for

Responsible Growth v. City of Rialto, 208 Cal. App. 4th 899, 945 (2012) (describing the general rule against deferred mitigation measures). As the California Supreme Court has stated, "CEQA's demand for meaningful information 'is not satisfied by simply stating information will be provided in the future." Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 431 (2007). Permitting the City to bypass the project-specific analysis called for by the Specific Plan EIR would undermine the "[f]undamental purpose of CEQA... to ensure that environmental considerations play a significant role in governmental decision-making." Joshua Tree Downtown Bus. All. v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 1 Cal. App. 5th 677, 683 (2016) (internal quotations omitted).

C. The Project Is Inconsistent With And Disregards The PA-1 Specific Plan.
Thus, the City's threadbare environmental review relied entirely on the general program environmental review contained in the PA-1 Specific Plan EIR, despite that document's clear warnings that site-specific review was not done for many of the project-specific impacts identified in this section. Furthermore, even if the City intends to rely on a CEQA exemption based on the Specific Plan, it can only do so to the extent that the Project is consistent with the PA-1 Specific Plan, as explained further in Section D below. The numerous inconsistencies between the Project and the Specific Plan preclude such a finding here and make clear that the City must perform substantial further analysis in order to fulfill its CEQA obligations.

1. Traffic

The recently prepared Environmental Analysis relies on a traffic study and related analysis the City prepared for the Specific Plan EIR. As raised in prior comment letters submitted on behalf of Discovery during the Specific Plan EIR process (attached hereto as Exhibits "D" and "E" and incorporated herein by reference), the Specific Plan EIR failed to address a number of impacts relating to traffic, including likely increases in traffic to the south of the Specific Plan arca, where Discovery has proposed a project. Furthermore, the Specific Plan EIR did not address the request of the California Department of Transportation for an analysis of certain additional intersections.

However, in light of the City's reliance on the Specific Plan EIR for analysis of the Project's impacts on traffic and circulation, the most critical deficiency of the traffic study is its outdated data. The Specific Plan EIR analyzed existing intersection operations using traffic volumes collected in the fall of 2016. DEIR, p. 3.14-14. Given the rapid growth of Brentwood during this period, this data can no longer be considered adequately current and must be updated. The CalTrans Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impacts Studies states that "[g]enerally a [traffic impact study] requires updating every two years" and "may require updating sooner in rapidly developing areas." Guide for the Preparation of Traffic Impact Studies, State of California Department of Transportation, p. 5. In a quickly growing city such as Brentwood, traffic data that is more than three years old cannot be relied upon for project-specific analysis, particularly in light of the deficiencies originally identified in the Specific Plan EIR's circulation analysis. In addition, it is not clear that the numerous mitigation measures identified in the Specific Plan EIR-which call for numerous improvements to be made by the Cityhave been

38349\13012879.2

January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTELULP

Page 10

completed. DEIR, pp. ES-26-ES-27. At the very least, a focused traffic memorandum or re-
evaluation of traffic volumes at impacted intersections should be prepared.
In light of the above, the City's existing analysis of the Project's potential impact on traffic is deficient and must be updated in order to comply with CEQA.

2. Geology and Soils
The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR acknowledges the potential for significant impacts stemming from seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction. DEIR, p. 3.6-18. Accordingly, the Specific Plan EIR requires that "[a]ll future projects within the Specific Plan Area would be
required to prepare geotechnical soils investigations to address seismic safety issues and provide adequate mitigation for potential hazards identified." DEIR, p. 3.6-19. Specifically, Action SA 1a "[r]equire[s] the submission of geologic and soils reports for all new developments" and further provides that "[t]he geologic risk areas that are determined from these studies shall have standards established and recommendations shall be incorporated into development." DEIR, p. 3.6-19. Here, there is no evidence that the required investigations have been conducted or that the necessary reports were completed for the Project. The recently prepared Environmental Analysis indicates that further analysis is being improperly deferred, stating that "[t]he proposed project would be required to prepare geotechnical soils investigations to address seismic safety issues and provide adequate mitigation for potential hazards identified." Environmental
Analysis, p. 148. Therefore, the Project is not in compliance with the Specific Plan and the City's environmental review is incomplete and inadequate.

3. Stormwater Contri

The PA-1 Specific Plan EIR acknowledges the possible impact of devclopment on stormwater-related violations of water quality standards or waste discharge requirements. To mitigate these potential impacts, Policy IF 4-3 "[r]equire[s] all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site and/or conveyed to the nearest drainage facility as part of the development review process and as required by the City's NPDES Municipal Regional Permit." DEIR, p. 3.9-16. Furthermore, "Project applicants shall mitigate any drainage impacts as necessary." DEIR, p. 3.9-16.
Similarly, Policy SA 2-2 consists of the following provisions:
Require all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site, treated, and/or conveyed to the nearest drainage facility as part of the development review process. Project applicants shall demonstrate that project implementation would not result in increases in the peak flow runoff to adjacent lands or drainage facilities that would exceed the design
capacity of the drainage facility or result in an increased potential for offsite
flooding.

3834943012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 11

DEIR, p. 3.9-17. Here, there is no evidence that the Project Applicant has submitted the required reports and detailed studies or been required to make the environmental showings required by these policies in the Specific Plan EIR. Nevertheless, the recently prepared Environmental Analysis makes the conclusory statement that "[t]he proposed project would not substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or the area.' Environmental Analysis, p. 155. This purported conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
Furthermore, it appears that the City has not complied with Brentwood Municipal Code's stormwater control provisions. While Condition of Approval 12.i states that the "Permittee shall comply with the ... Brentwood Municipal Code Chapter 14.20 'Stormwater Management and Discharge Control,'" this instruction impermissibly defers the required mitigation under the Municipal Code. Municipal Code Section 14.20.050(A) provides that "every application for a development project, including, but not limited to, a rezoning, tentative map, parcel map, conditional use permit, variance, site development permit, design review, or building permit that is subject to the development runoff requirements in the city's NPDES permit shall be accompanied by a stormwater control plan that meets the criteria in the most recent version of the Contra Costa Clean Water Program Stormwater C.3. Guidebook." (Emphasis added.) This provision indicates that the stormwater control plan must be submitted along with the design review application, which does not appear to have been done in this case and is not included in the Project documents that have been provided.
The recently prepared Environmental Analysis indicates that such plans remain hypothetical. That document states that "[t]he a proposed project is a C.3 regulated project and is required to include appropriate site design measures, source controls, and hydraulically-sized stormwater treatment measures." Environmental Analysis, p. 155. The City's approval of the Project thus failed to incorporate the requirements of the Municipal Code.
In light of the foregoing requirements and the absence of evidence that the Project complied, it is clear that there are potential Projcct stormwater impacts that have not been properly evaluated by the City, thereby barring the grant of any Project approvals.

4. Drainage
With regard to potential impacts of development on drainage patterns, the PA-1 Specific Plan recognizes that "[b]ased upon the wide scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan, development of detailed, site-specific information on this impact is not feasible." DEIR, p. 3.9-19. Thus, to address potential site-specific impacts, the Specific Plan EIR includes the following requirement:
Each future development project must also include detailed project specific floodplain and drainage studies that assess the drainage characteristics and flood risks so that an appropriate storm drainage plan can be prepared to control storm water runoff, both during and after construction. The drainage plan will ultimately include project specific best management measures that are designed to allow for natural recharge and infiltration of stormwater. Construction of storm
drainage improvements would occur as part of an overall devclopment project and

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+ MARTEL LLP

Page 12

is considered in the environmental impacts associated with project construction and implementation as addressed throughout this EIR.
DEIR, p. 3.9-19. This section of the Specific Plan EIR also incorporates Policy FI 4-3 and Policy SA 2-2, both of which are required under the stormwater control elements of the EIR. as described in Section III.C.3 above. As described therein, these policies require development projects to demonstrate how stormwater runoff will be contained and that project implementation will not result in increases in peak flow runoff that will exceed the capacity of drainage facilities or increase the potential for flooding. DEIR, pp. 3.9-19-20.
There is no evidence that the Project Applicant performed the studies or demonstrations required to ensure the Project has no significant impacts with regard to drainage. Therefore. the project-specific environmental review envisioned by the Specific Plan EIR has not taken place and the City's approval violates CEQA.

5. Noise

As acknowledged in the Staff Report and Planning Commission Resolution No. 19-038, future developments within the PA-1 Specific Plan area are required to obtain noise studies. The Staff Report indicates that a noise study was prepared for the Project, which "concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report.' Staff Report, p. 10. Moreover, "[a]ny alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant." Staff Report, p. 10; Resolution 19-038, p. 1. However, neither the study nor the requirements of the report are provided or incorporated into the Conditions of Approval.
By permitting a consultant to devise mitigation measures and monitor the Project Applicant's compliance, the City has "improperly delegate[d] the [City's] legal responsibility to assess environmental impact." Sundstrom y. Cty. of Mendocino, 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307 (1988). Furthermore, the City appears to have imposed insufficient mitigation measures to address the potential noise impacts from the Project. Accordingly, the City's environmental review was insufficient under CEQA.

6. Project Density

The PA-1 Specific Plan provides for 405 units within the high density residential ("HDR") zone, which totals 27.02 acres within the Specific Plan area. PA-1 Specific Plan, Table 3.12-4. The Specific Plan EIR relies on this figure to evaluate numerous environmental impacts of the Specific Plan, including traffic and air quality. PA-1 Specific Plan, p. 3.3-29. Howcver, due to the density of this Project, the remaining HDR portion of the Specific Plan area will necessarily be inconsistent with the Specific Plan.
As approved, the Project consists of 288 units on 14.4 acres. Because there are 27.02 total acres approved for HDR development-requiring a minimum of ten units per acrcthe remaining 12.62 acres must have a minimum of 126 units in order to fulfill the Specific Plan's

38349\3012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTELuLP

Page 13

density requirements. However, 126 additional units will result in a total of 414 units-which exceeds the 405 HDR units on which the Specific Plan EIR's projections are based. Moreover, if subsequent HDR development has a density at the upper end of the permitted density range, the total number of HDR units might exceed the Specific Plan's projections by as many as 145 units. This would render much of the Specific Plan EIR's analysis inaccurate, especially with regard to issues such as traffic and air quality. Accordingly, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan because it will likely cause subsequent HDR development to exceed the Specific Plan's projected number of HDR units.

D. The Project Is Not Properly Subject To CEQA Streamlining Or Exemptions.
Not until the filing of the instant appeal did the City indicate whether it was attempting to bypass further review through a CEQA exemption or streamlining. The recently prepared Environmental Analysis states that the City is relying upon the streamlining provision of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183. However, Section 15183 does not excuse the City's failure to perform analysis of the environmental issues discussed above, nor does the CEQA exemption applicable to Specific Plan projects apply here.

1. CEQA Streamlining • Guidelines Section 15183
While CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 permits streamlined environmental review of "projects which are consistent with the development density established by existing zoning, community plan, or general plan policies for which an EIR was certified," streamlining does not permit subsequent projects to evade environmental review altogether. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. Such projects are subject to a rigorous set of CEQA requirements, including a determination of "whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183. Guidelines Section 15183 specifically references the use of an initial study to evaluate whether any of the Project's environmental impacts:

(1) Arc peculiar to the project or the parcel on which the project would be located, (2) Were not analyzed as significant effects in a prior EIR on the zoning action, general plan or community plan with which the project is consistent, (3) Are potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts which were not discussed in the prior EIR prepared for the general plan, community plan or zoning action, or (4) Are previously identified significant effects which, as a result of substantial ncw information which was not known at the time the EIR was certified, are determined to have a morc severe adverse impact than discussed in the prior EIR.
14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15183(b).
Here, the Project's potential impacts on traffic, stormwater control, drainage, and noise, among others, may fall into one of these categories. However, because the City never performed
an Initial Study, there is insufficient evidence for the City to make a determination as to the

383493012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+ MARTEL LIP

Page 14

Project's impacts. In its response to Discovery's appeal, City Staff refers to its recently prepared Environmental Analysis as "an environmental checklist evaluation, similar to an abbreviated Initial Study." Thus, Staff acknowledges that it did not prepare a full Initial Study. Accordingly, Staff did not fulfill the requirements of Guidelines Section 15183. Moreover, the Environmental Analysis relies primarily.on conclusory statements or proposals for later review, neither of which suffices for project-specific environmental analysis. See Leonoff v. Monterey Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 222 Cal. App. 3d 1337, 1346, (1990) (holding that "[t]o facilitate review, the initial study should contain supporting evidence and not mere conclusions about potential environmental effects"); Vineyard Area Citizens, supra, 40 Cal. 4th at 431 (holding that "simply stating information will be provided in the future" does not satisfy CEQA).
Nevertheless, even if the Environmental Analysis were deemed adequate as an Initial Study (which it is not), the City neglected to complete the environmental process by preparing a Negative Declaration. Guidelines Section 15183 permits agencies to avoid performing redundant environmental review that is already contained in a prior EIR. Here, even the Environmental Analysis supports the conclusion that certain project-specific impacts will require further study and possible mitigation. Simply acknowledging such impacts in an Initial Study would not be adequate-even if finding that no Project impacts are potentially significant, the City must memorialize that finding in a Negative Declaration, which requires a more empirical analysis than has been provided so far. See Aptos Council v. Cty. of Santa Cruz, 10 Cal. App. 5th 266, 287 (2017) ("A decision by an agency to adopt negative declaration is essentially a determination that the project will not have a significant environmental impact.").
To the extent that the City would rely on appropriate mitigation measures for a finding that no significant effects will occur, a Mitigated Negative Declaration would be required. See Sullivan v. City of San Luis Obispo, No. B158882, 2003 WL 22211538, at *1 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) (stating a negative declaration is appropriate "where potentially significant environmental effects are identified but mitigated by project revisions to a point where no significant effects will occur"). Accordingly, the City cannot rely on the streamlining provisions of Guidelines Section 15183 in order to avoid the preparation and required public review and comment for an additional CEQA environmental document.

2. CEQA Exemption - Guidelines Section 15182

CEQA Guidelines Section 15182 provides that "a residential project undertaken pursuant to and in conformity to [a] specific plan is exempt from CEQA." 14 CCR § 15182(c)(1). This mirrors the exemption contained in Govt. Code section 65457, which provides that "[a]ny residential development project, including any subdivision, or any zoning change that is undertaken to implement and is consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified after January I, 1980" is exempt from CEQA. However, as detailed above, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan in numerous ways. The Project fails to implement the Specific Plan requirements with regard to traffic, geology and soils,
stormwater control, drainage, noise, and project density. These omissions are not minor discrepancies, as they contravene explicit requirements of the Specific Plan. Furthermore, development of the Project will, as previously-explained, require subscquent development

38349\13012879.2

Mayor Taylor and Members of the City Council FARELLA
January 28, 2020 BRAUN+MARTEL LLP

Page 15

projects to either exceed the 405 HDR units envisioned by the Specific Plan or contain a density of less than the 10 units per acre required by the Specific Plan.
The Specific Plan EIR states that its program-level analysis considers the broad environmental effects of the proposed PA-1 Specific Plan to allow comprehensive consideration of the reasonably anticipated scope of future development within the Plan area but that "not all aspects of the future development are known at this stage in the planning process, as there are no
specific development applications currently pending within the Plan area." DEIR, p. 1.0-2. Accordingly, the Specific Plan calls for subsequent project-specific review, which CEQA permits. See Town of Atherton v. California High-Speed Rail Auth., 228 Cal. App. 4th 314, 344 (2014) (permitting program EIR to defer development of site-specific information "until such time as the lead agency prepares a future environmental document in connection with a project of a more limited geographic scale"). Avoiding the subsequent site-specific review called for by the Specific Plan EIR renders the Project inconsistent with the Specific Plan. Accordingly, Guidelines Section 15182 clearly would not exempt the Project from further CEQA review.

IV. THE CITY'S DESIGN REVIEW APPROVAL WAS IMPROPER.

A. The City's Findings Were Based On Insufficient Evidence.
The City's approval of the Project purports to make the requisite findings pursuant to Municipal Code Section 17.820.008, which provides:
The following criteria shall be applied in considering all applications for design and site devclopment review approval: A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilitics on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and loading facilities, lighting, signing and access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to 'an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.
B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or traffic.
The applicable findings included within Planning Commission Resolution 19-038 state in
part:

The siting and internal arrangement of the structure and circulation, parking and loading, lighting, access, landscape, hardscape, signing, and utility facilities on the site are conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient, and harmonious development insomuch as the buildings are is designed in such a way as to provide an attractive and interesting street scene from Amber Lane and Shady Willow Lane. The building is designed to reduce massing and introduce development on a scale that is appropriate and consistent with the PA-I Specific Plan with hardscape and landscaping to provide an attractive development.

Page 16

Resolution 19-038, p. 3.
However, the submittal of detailed designs for key design components of the Project, including the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, and signage, have yet to be submitted. For example, as explained in the Staff Report, "elevations, materials and design of the carport is not depicted in the project plans, and staff included a draft condition of approval requiring the design of the carports to be brought before the Design Review Subcommittee to ensure consistency with the rest of the complex." Staff Report, p. 5.
In addition, the Staff Report recognizes that the Project's "proposed signage is not consistent with the City's Municipal Code in that it exceeds the maximum number of freestanding signs per parcel." Staff Report, p. 7. The City attempted to remedy these deficiencies by imposing Conditions of Approval Nos. 6 to 9, which require that the Project 6 Applicant submit further plans regarding carports, landscaping, exterior lighting, and signage to the Community Development Department. Exhibit A to Resolution 19-038, p. 1. However, the fact that this further information is required for a full analysis of these Project elements only makes it more obvious that the City had insufficient details to properly make the required design review findings. The City cannot use Conditions of Approval to circumvent design review.
Accordingly, the City's decision to approve design review was not made on an adequate evidentiary basis. Findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence contained in the administrative record, which comprises the entire body of evidence presented for consideration in connection with the project, and provides the basis to judge whether sufficient evidence supports the findings and decision of the agency. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515 (1974) (holding that court "must scrutinize the record and determine whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency's findings and whether these findings support the agency's decision"). A governmental entity "must render findings sufficient both to enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review and, in the event of review, to apprise a reviewing court of the basis of the board's decision." Id. at 514.
Morcover, substantial evidence must support an administrative agency's findings and the findings must support the decision." Id. Here, there are insufficient facts to support the City's finding that the Project meets the applicable criteria for approval with regard to the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, and signage. Rather than approve the Project with the Conditions of Approval requiring the Applicant to submit further information, the City was obligated to delay approval until the requisite findings could be made. Accordingly, the City's approval was in error and must be reversed.

In light of the foregoing, we urge the City Council to reverse the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, deny the requested Project approvals, and acknowledge that the Project cannot be approved unless and until the City performs the required CEQA analysis and design
review.

Re: December 3, 2019 Planning Commission Agenda Item No. 2: Amber Lane Apartments Design Review Application (DR 19-010)
Dear Chair Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission:
This office represents Discovery Builders, Inc., the applicant and a long time developer in the City of Brentwood. On the agenda for your meeting tonight is the proposed 288-unit Amber Lane Apartments project (the "Project"), with a recommendation for approval. For purposes of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq., the recommendation for approval appears to rely on the Environmental Impact Report (the 'EIR") prepared for the PA-1 Specific Plan, which was adopted on November 13, 2018. For purposes of compliance with the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan ("HCP"), it appears conditions of approval are proposed to require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward but there does not appear to be a Planning Survey Report completed which is a requirement of the HCP. Also, nowhere in the Project approval documents is there a discussion or analysis on impacts to the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District.

As discussed below, and among other issues, the environmental determination for the Project is inadequate to comply with CEQA, the Project itself is inconsistent with policies of the Specific Plan, and the lack of a Planning Survey Report is inconsistent with the City's HCP implementation ordinance.

1. The CEQA Determination is Inadequate
The staff report prepared for the Project (the "Staff Report") does not identify a specific exemption under CEQA that would serve as the basis for foregoing the preparation of any environmental document whatsoever. However, the Staff Report states that "[t]he environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the [PA-1 Specific Plan] EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review," which suggests that the Project falls within the scope of the Specific Plan EIR. As you may know, on behalf of our client, we reviewed and submitted
extensive comments on the EIR prepared for the PA-1 Specific Plan, and the general response

Hanson Bridgett LLP 1676 N. California Blvd., Suite 620, Walnut Creek, CA 94596 hansonbridgei.com

Page 2

at that time was that the EIR would provide streamlining benefits for future development within the specific plan area, based on project-specific environmental review for specific, proposed projects. Based on the Staff Report, no project specific environmental review or analysis has
been conducted.

To the extent that the streamlining provisions of CEQA Guidelines Section 15183, for projects that are consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified, is relied upon, a determination as to whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site must be made based on an initial study or other analysis. (14 Cal.Code Regs., Sec. 15183.) Unless such a determination is made, any approval of the Project will not conform to the requirements of CEQA. Moreover, the Project appears inconsistent with the Specific Plan, including, as one example, Specific Plan Policy IF- 7.1 which requires a project applicant within the Specific Plan Area to coordinate with the East Contra Costa Fire Protection District in planning for adequate fire and emergency service. We
do not see any conditions or mitigation or correspondence from East Contra Costa Fire Protection District outlining how adequate fair share contribution for fire and emergency service is being provided by the Project.
The record does not document the basis for any exemption or streamlining pursuant to CEQA. At a minimum, the grounds for the environmental determination, supporting facts, and the reasons the exceptions to the exemption do not apply must be identified. (See Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106 [the agency invoking the exemption has the burden of demonstrating it applies].) The factual support for an exemption determination "Is all the more important where the record shows, as it does here, that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Id. at 117.)

2. The Project Does Not Comply With the City's HCP Implementation Ordinance

With regard to the Project's compliance with the HCP. the Staff Report states the following:
The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat or species are found during pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or
minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.
This is inconsistent with Brentwood Municipal Code Section 16.168.050, For every application for development, a standard Planning Survey Report (PSR) is completed. The Code Section establishes HCP/NCCP take authorization application procedures and unequivocally mandates the following:

16071297.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood

Page 3

A. The city shall require project applicants for any and all affected development projects to submit an application for take authorization to the director for review simultaneously with the submittal of the request for approval of a development project. The director may require that the application be submitted using a standard application form. At minimum, the application for take authorization must include the following information to be determined complete:

2. One or more reports documenting the methods and results of planning surveys and the methods of applicable preconstruction surveys and construction monitoring, in accordance with Chapter 6 of the HCP/NCCP.
(Emphasis added.) Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request that complete environmental review of the proposed Project be conducted prior to its consideration for
approval.

Re: December 17, 2019 Planning Commission Agenda Item No, 3: Amber Lane Apartments Design Review Application (DR 19-010)
Dear Chair Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission:
We are writing to follow up on our letter dated December 3, 2019, a copy of which is attached hereto, relating to the proposed Amber Lane Apartments project (the "Project") which is before is you tonight with a recommendation for approval. As you know, the proposed Project includes the development of nine two- and three-story apartment buildings for a total of 288 units, along with a 5,564 square-foot recreation building, and related amenities, including a pool and spa, community center, parking, trash enclosures, and landscaping.
Since December 3, 2019, we understand the draft conditions of approval were revised to address fire protection and emergency response service requirements, and we understand that a Planning Survey Report was previously completed in accordance with Section 16.168.050 of the Brentwood Municipal Code, However, concerns regarding the lack of any project-specific environmental review to support reliance on the Priority Area One Specific Plan Environmental Impact Report adopted on November 13, 2018 (the "Specific Plan EIR") for approval, and the lack of compliance with the City's application processing requirements remain unaddressed.
As discussed in detail below, the Prolect cannot be approved because (1) the lack of project- specific environmental review and deferral of mitigation measures render the City's environmental determination inadequate and (2) the required design review findings cannot be made and the processing of the Project's design review application does not conform with the City's Code requirements.

1. The Environmental Determination for the Project is Unsupported and Inadequate
For purposes of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the recommendation for approval appears to rely on the program-level Specific Plan EIR. For projects that are consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified, a determination as to whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the project or its site must be made based on an initial study or other analysis. (14 Cal.Code Regs., Sec. 15183.)

For the reasons below, the City cannot rely on the Specific Plan EIR without conducting any project-level analysis.

a, A Project Specific Analysis Has Not Been Undertaken as Required by CEQA, the PA-1 Specific Plan, and the Specific Plan EIR.
CEQA. In order to determine whether a program EIR is sufficient to approval a subsequent project, a lead agency must engage in a project-level analysis. The agency must first consider whether the project falls within the scope of the program EIR by determining whether it will result in environmental effects that were not examined in the EIR. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c).) If it is found that the project would have environmental effects that were not examined in the program EIR, the lead agency must prepare an initial study to determine the appropriate envirormental document to address those effects. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(1).)
If the lead agency determines the activity is covered by the program EIR, it must then consider whether any new environmental effects could occur, or new mitigation measures would be required. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(2).) To do so, the agency considers whether any of the circumstances listed CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 trigger the need for further CEQA review. Such triggering circumstances are generally (1) changes in the project or in the circumstances under which it is undertaken that require evaluation of new significant environmental effects and (2) the availability of new information relating to significant effects or mitigation measures that was not known and could not have been known when the previous EIR was prepared. (14 Cal Code Regs §15162.)
If no new significant effects could occur and no new mitigation measures are necessary, it can approve the activity as being within the scope of the project covered by the program EIR, and no additional environmental document is required. (14 Cal Code Regs §15168(c)(2).) If, however, the agency determines that new environmental impacts could occur, or new mitigation measures would be required, further environmental review would be required. To the extent the City proposes to rely on an exemption under CEQA, it must still consider whether subsequent or supplemental review is required. (Gov. Code Sec. 65457.)

ii. The PA-1 Specific Plan. The Specific Plan also contemplates project-level review, and provides that when future development applications within the Specific Plan area are received by the City, these projects will be reviewed for consistency with the specific plan. For projects that are found to be consistent with scope of activities analyzed in the EIR prepared for the Specific Plan, and which properly implement all relevant policies and actions contained in the General Plan, additional project-specific CEQA analysis is intended to be streamlined. Future projects within the Specific Plan area would be subject to other City procedures such as those related to design and site development review, and conditional use permits. (Specific Plan, p. 10-15.) As in discussed in detail below, the Project does not implement, and is therefore inconsistent with, the applicable General Plan policies. A finding of consistency requires more than the generalized conclusion that the Project involves a permitted residential use type and falls within the permitted density range under the PA-1 Specific Plan.

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood

iii. The Specific Plan EIR. The Specific Plan EIR states that its program-level analysis considers the broad environmental effects of the proposed .PA-1 Specific Pian to allow comprehensive consideration of the reasonably anticipated scope of future development within the Plan area but that "not all aspects of the future development are known at this stage in the planning process, as there are no specific development applications currently pending within the Plan area." (Draft EIR, p. 1.0-2.) Thus, future development projects and activities within the Specific Plan Area that require further discretionary approvals, including Site Plan and Design Review, will be examined in light of the EIR and in terms of consistency with the PA-1 Specific Plan, to determine whether additional environmental documentation must be prepared.

b. The Environmental Determination Contained in the Staff Report is Not Supported By Any Evidence

The Environmental Determination described in the staff report prepared for the Project relies on the Specific Plan EIR to conclude that no environmental review is required, without any analysis. The environmental determination states the following:
The environmental effects of the development of the proposed project site are analyzed in the [Specific Plan] EIR, and there is no new information or substantial changes that require additional environmental review. However, as identified in the EIR noise chapter, any future development within the plan area is required to a obtain a noise study. As such, Veneklasen Associates prepared a noise study for the proposed Amber Lane Apartment development project, and concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. Any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant.

The PA-1 EIR identified several potentially-significant impacts; however, mitigation measures are incorporated to reduce those impacts to less than significant levels. All mitigation measures in the EIR and noise report not addressed by the standard conditions of approval are included as project-specific conditions of approval. No further environmental review is required at this time.
The project site is considered habitat (cropland) per the East Contra Costa County Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), and as such does require various pre-construction surveys to be included as the project moves forward. Therefore, draft conditions of approval are included to address the HCP requirements. These conditions ensure that if any habitat or species are found during pre-construction surveys, appropriate avoidance and/or minimization measures will be required. In addition, appropriate

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019
Page 4

mitigation fees will need to be paid prior to grading permit issuance per the HCP.

(Staff Report, pp. 2-3.) Again, a determination of project-level consistency requires a close examination of the Project's compliance with policies set forth in the PA-1 Specific Plan, which has not been undertaken.

C. The Project is Not Consistent with the Specific Plan
Instead of requiring project-level compliance with the policies set forth in the Specific Plan EIR as necessary to demonstrate that the Project falls within the scope of the PA-1 Specific Plan and EIR, the consistency requirements appear to be deferred as conditions of approval in some instances and ignored altogether in others.
For example, in the area of Geology and Soils, the Draft EIR states that as future development projects are considered by the City, each project will be evaluated for conformance with City standards and policies, and would also be analyzed for potential environmental impacts, consistent with the requirements of CEQA. (Draft EIR, p. 3.6-20.) Among the policies with which future projects within the Specific Plan area must be consistent is General Plan Action SA 1a, which requires "the submission of geologic and soils reports for all new developments. The geologic risk areas that are determined from these studies shall have standards established and recommendations shall be incorporated into development." (Draft EIR, pp. 3.6-17 and 3.6-18.) Here, there is no evidence that such studies have been submitted and there are no standards incorporated it the conditions of approval.
Similarly, in terms of stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge, the Draft EIR states that subsequent development projects proposed within the Specific Plan Area, such as residential projects, would result in new impervious surfaces and could reduce stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge. Due to the variation in infiltration rates based on the overlying soil types, "[t]he City must evaluate individual projects as they are proposed to ensure that they would not result in a significant interference with recharge. (Impact 3.9-2, Draft EIR, p. 3.9-17.) This evaluation has not been done.
With regard to flooding, subsequent development projects proposed within the PA-1 Plan area are required to implement General Plan policies and actions to ensure that implementation of the proposed PA-1 Specific Plan would have a less than significant impact related to these issues. Among the General Plan policies identified in the Draft EIR is General Plan Policy SA 2- 2, which is to require "all development projects to demonstrate how storm water runoff will be detained or retained on-site, treated, and/or conveyed to the nearest drainage facility as part-of- the development revlew process. Project applicants shall demonstrate that project implementation would not result in increases in the peak flow runoff to adjacent lands or drainage facilities that would exceed the design capacity of the drainage facility or result in an increased potential for off-site flooding.' (Draft EIR, p. 3.9-19.)
Instead of evaluating the proposed Project for consistency and compliance with this policy, the draft Conditions of Approval improperly defer the analysis. Condition of Approval No. 14 requires prior to issuance of a grading permit or of any grading and/or demolition work, identification of any special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood, and hydrology

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood

Page 5

and hydraulic calculations signed by a licensed engineer demonstrating that the Project will adequately collect and convey all runoff within the Project as well as the entire developed watershed upstream and/or from upstream neighboring properties. Condition of Approval No. 14 states that the Permittee shall be responsible for mitigating the natural stormwater run-off from adjoining properties to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.

d. New Noise Mitigation Measures May Trigger Requirement for Subsequent Environmental Review
New mitigation measures relating to noise impacts may be required, which would trigger further environmental review under CEQA Guidelines Section 15162. The Staff Report indicates a noise study was prepared for the Project, and that it concluded that various noise mitigation methods will need to be utilized to satisfy the noise criteria described in the report. The Staff Report further states that any alteration of mitigation methods that deviate from requirements of the report will need to be reviewed by the acoustical consultant. Neither the study nor the requirements of the report are provided or incorporated in the conditions of approval-Condition of Approval No. 12.c. requires compliance with the City's noise regulations, and draft Condition of Approval No. 13.i requires a detailed noise analysis to ensure compliance with all applicable noise requirements, and provide any Project-specific recommendations subject to the review and approval of the City.

e, Incorporation by Reference to the Specific Plan EIR MMRP Constitutes Impermissible Deferred Mitigation
Draft Condition of Approvai No. 4 requires the Permittee to "comply with all applicable Mitigation Measures identified in the PA-1 Specific Plan Mitigation and Monitoring Program (MMRP) as prepared in conjunction with the EIR." The implementation of mitigation measures cannot be delayed beyond the start of the project activity that causes the impact in question. (POET, LLC v State Air Resources Bd. (2013) 218- CA4th 681, 740.) Based on this standard, the incorporation by reference to the range of mitigation measures identified in the Specific Plan MMRP results in the impermissible deferral of mitigation measures because the impacts to be mitigated would be caused by the start of the Project activity. .

As one example, Mitigation Measure 3.4-1 states that future project proponent(s) must conduct preconstruction surveys to avoid or minimize the impacts on special-status species." Similarly, Mitigation Measure 3.4-2, 3.4-4, 3.4-7, 3.4-8, and 3.4-11 require preconstruction studies or surveys. There is no evidence that these surveys, studies, or analyses have occurred or that concrete plans are in place to ensure timely compliance with these specific plan EIR requirements. In short, approving the Project prior to satisfying the requirements set forth in the MMRP for specific projects, Impermissibly defer multiple mitigation measures required by the specific plan EIR and would therefore violate CEQA. While a noise study was apparently prepared as required by Mitigation Measure 3.11-2, the study does not appear in the record and is only one of several surveys and studies that cannot be further deferred.

2. The Findings Required for Site Development Design Review Approval Cannot be Made

Findings made in support of an agency's decision must be based on evidence contained in the in administrative record, which comprises the entire body of evidence presented for consideration in connection with the project, and provides the basis to judge whether sufficient evidence supports the findings and decision of the agency. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community V. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515). A governmental entity "must render findings sufficient both to enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review and, in the event of review, to apprise a reviewing court of the basis of the board's decision." (Id. at 514.) Substantial evidence must support an administrative agency's findings and the findings must support the decision." (Id.) The findings must "bridge the analytical gap" between the evidence and the decision. (Id. at 521.) Here, there are no facts to
support that the Project meets the applicable criteria for approval.
The draft Resolution No. 19-038 to approve the Design Review application purports to make the following findings associated with the site development criteria set forth Section 17.820.008 of the Brentwood Municipal Code:
A. The siting and internal arrangement of all structures and other facilities on the site, including the land uses, internal circulation, off-street parking and loading facilities, lighting, signing and
access to and from public rights-of-way, shall be conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient and harmonious development.
B. The proposed development shall not have adverse environmental effects on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use, topography or traffic.
Specifically, in support of these findings, the Staff Report states the following, despite the fact that detailed design plans have not been provided and are required as conditions of approval:
The siting and internal arrangement of the structure and circulation, parking and loading, lighting, access, landscape,
hardscape, signing, and utility facilities on the site are conducive to an orderly, attractive, efficient, and harmonious development insomuch as the buildings are is designed in such a way as to provide an attractive and interesting street scene from Amber Lane and Shady Willow Lane. The building is designed to reduce massing and introduce development on a scale that is appropriate and consistent with the PA-1 Specific Plan with hardscape and
landscaping to provide an attractive development. Additionally, as
designed, the Project will not have an adverse environmental effect on adjacent developments, existing or potential, by reason of conflicts in land use in that the proposed development adheres to the established PA-1 Specific Plan land use designation of High Density Residential. Conflicts relating to topography are avoided,

16112813.1

Chair Dirk Zeigler and Members of the Brentwood Planning Commission City of Brentwood
December 17, 2019 Page 7

given the flat topography of both the subject site, as well as adjacent properties. Finally, traffic conflicts are avoided with the provision of roadway improvements for Amber Lane and Shady Willow.

However, the submittal of detailed designs for key design components of the Project, including the carports, landscape plans for street frontage landscape areas, exterior lighting, signage, have yet to be submitted. As explained in the Staff Report, "elevations, materials and design of the carport is not depicted in the project plans, and staff included draft condition of approval requiring the design of the carports to be brought before the Design Review Subcommittee to ensure consistency with the rest of the complex." (Staff Report, p. 3; draft Conditions of Approval Nos. 6-9.) A draft condition of approval also requires the submittal of detailed landscape and irrigation plans for review and approval prior to the issuance of a building permit in order to ensure that all plantings will be in compliance with the City's Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. (Id.) As conditioned, all external building-mounted light fixtures and parking lot standards are to be of either a cut off or full-cut off design in order to ensure that light s cast downward and into the site instead of being allowed to extend onto surrounding properties, in conformance with the Specific Plan. It is not possible to make the required findings because there is no evidence to support them.
Further, with regard to signage, the Staff Report indicates that the proposed three monument entry signs is not consistent with the City's Municipal Code in that it exceeds the maximum number of freestanding signs per parcel. Yet, instead of requiring compliance prior to any approval, a draft condition a of approval requires a modification of this signage for compliance with the municipal code. In addition, the condition requires the installation of directory signage for the site, as required by the Specific Plan pursuant to an administrative sign permit application with detailed plans and specification for review and approval by the Community Development Department. We note that the lack of the directory signage is yet another example of the Project's inconsistency with the PA-1 Specific Plian.
Finally, the separate consideration of each of these permits and approvals required for the Project, the application Lot Merger merging the three parcels that comprise the site violates the requirement of Code Section 17.820.006, which states that the architectural review committee "shall review and act on architectural plans concurrently with any other land use permit or entitlement application submitted to the city, such as a conditional use permit or tentative parcel or tract map.' The separate processing and consideration of the required approvals also potentially result in improper piecemealing under CEQA.
Based on the foregoing, we respectfully request that you defer further consideration of the Project until such time as complete application materials consistent with the Code and PA-1 Specific Plan are submitted and project-specific environmental review has been completed.
Very truly yours,

Robia Crisp

Re: Priority Area Specific Plan Draft EIR

Dear Mr. Nolthenius:

This office represents Discovery Builders, Inc., the owner and developer of the Bridle Gate residential development project located immediately south of the proposed Priority Area Specific Plan ("Specific Plan" or "Project") area and directly connected by way of an extension of Bridle Gate Drive. On behalf of our client, we have reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Report dated June 2018 and prepared for the Specific Plan (the "DEIR"), including the Traffic Data included as Appendix D to the DEIR ("Traffic Study"). We submit the following comments for your consideration, primarily relating to the adequacy of the DEIR's identification and evaluation of the Project's potential impacts in the area of Transportation and Circulation, including the Project's potential impacts on the roadways and intersections within the Bridle Gate project area. The DEIR must be revised to take into account the traffic that will be directed south to the Bridle Gate project area.
To provide context, the Specific Plan area is generally bounded by Lone Tree Way to the north, Shady Willow Lane to the east, Sand Creek to the south, and Heidorn Ranch Road to the west. The Specific Plan area is bisected by State Route 4, described in the DEIR as the most heavily- travelled highway corridor in Brentwood. The DEIR indicates that the full buildout of the Specific Plan Area could accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population a of 4,569 persons and up to 3,834,086 square feet of non-residential uses for a maximum non- residential population of 8,383 employees. (DEIR, p. 2.0-7.)
The Bridle Gate Project is mixed-use project located immediately south of Sand Creek Road, and west of State Route 4. An alignment of Bridle Gate Drive that will extend north from Sand Creek Road to Old Sand Creek Road and parallel to State Route 4, bisects the commercial portion of the Bridle Gate project site and directly connects the project to the southwestern portion of the proposed Specific Plan area north of Sand Creek Road.
Despite the increased traffic volumes that will be generated by the Project and the connectivity in the circulation network, the DEIR does not consider the Project's impacts on roadways and intersections to the south of the Project area, including the intersection at Sand Creek Road and North Gate Drive/Bridle Gate Road, for the purposes of its Transportation and Circulation analysis.

While the Transportation and Circulation Section of the DEIR describes the Future Plus Project scenario identifies the completion of circulation projects, including the construction of Bridle Gate Drive from the southern boundary of the Specific Plan Area to San Jose Avenue, the intersection and freeway operational analysis, as well as the vehicle miles traveled metrics fails to take into account the Project-generated traffic that will impact the intersection within the Bridle Gate Project area. (See DEIR, p. 3.14-32.) The EIR should, at a minimum, include as a study intersection, the intersection at Sand Creek Road and Bridle Gate Road and this should include an analysis of proportional cost sharing for the bridge that will need to be built across Sand Creek. It should also include an analysis of other intersections within the Bridle Gate project that will be impacted. There should also be an analysis of the impacts to Sand Creek Road, a requirement for cost sharing, including the Sand Creek Road bridge to provide access to Antioch.

The EIR must identify the Project's impacts to this intersection, and other intersections and where potentially significant impacts are identitied, propose and describe mitigation measures designed to minimize, reduce or avoid each identified potentially significant impact whenever it is feasible to do so. (CEQA Sec. 21002.1(b); 14 Cal.Code Regs., Sec. 15126.4.) We would note that the traffic study for the Bridle Gate project did not anticipate and therefore did not analyze the traffic that would be generated to the north of the project onto Bridle Gate Road (referred in the Bridle Gate traffic study as North Gate Road). It assigned no outside traffic to this connector to the north.

While the inadequacies of the analyses are most pronounced in the Transportation and Circulation section of the DEIR, other sections, including the Project Description and Cumulative Impacts analysis, should be reviewed and revised to take into account the development of the Bridle Gate project. For example, the Surrounding Land Uses included in the Project Description merely state that adjoining lands to the south of the Specific Plan Area are designated for GC, P. R-LD, SCH, and Permanent Open Space (P-OS) uses, and should be revised to incorporate accurate information regarding the Bridle Gate Project.(DEIR, p. 2.0-5.)
In addition, the DEIR fails to take into consideration the Bridle Gate project in evaluating whether any cumulative impacts may be significant and if so, whether the Project's incremental effect is cumulatively considerable, i.e., that the incremental effects of the Project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects. (See 14 Cal.Code Regs., Sec. 15130.)

Without this additional information, the DEIR fails to provide sufficient, complete technical detail for the public to evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, fails to adequately mitigate potentially significant impacts, and fails to provide substantial evidence for its conclusions. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our comments and look forward to reviewing a revised document.

Very fruly yours, buglausn

Re: November 13, 2018 City Council Meeting Agenda Item No. E.1: (1) Certification of an Environmental Impact Report; (2) Adoption of a General Plan amendment (GPA 18- a 002); (3) Adoption of the Priority Area 1 Specific Plan (SPA 18-001); and (4) Adoption of a rezone (RZ 18-003) to implement the zoning text and map amendments within the Priority Area 1 Specific Plan

Dear Honorable Mayor Taylor and Councilmembers:
This office represents West Coast Home Builders, Inc., the owner and developer of the Bridle Gate residential development project located immediately south of the proposed approximately 431-acre Priority Area I Specific Plan ("Specific Plan" or "Project") area. On behalf of our client, we have reviewed the staff report dated November 13, 2018, prepared for your consideration of the Project and associated Final Draft Environmental Impact Report dated August 2018 (the "FEIR"), which the Planning Commission has recommended for certification.
We previously submitted a comment letter dated July 27, 2018 on the Draft EIR, as well as a letter to the Planning Commission dated October 16, 2018 relating to the adequacy of the FEIR, and a copy of which is included in the agenda packet for tonight's meeting. For the reasons described in detail in our prior correspondence, and largely ignored in both the Responses to Comments in the FEIR and the Staff Report, the FEIR does not satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") and must be revised and recirculated.

Under the PA-1 Specific Plan, the area will accommodate up to 2,041 dwelling units for a maximum residential population of 4,569 persons and up to 3,834,086 square feet of non- residential uses for a maximum non-residential population of 8,383 employees. Remarkably, the FEIR concludes that impacts will be less than significant and require no mitigation in the areas of Aesthetics, Air Quality, Geology and Soils, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Land Use and Planning, Population and Housing, Public Services and Recreation, and Utilities and Service Systems, without any environmental analysis. Moreover, the conclusions in the FEIR, including the Responses to Comments, are unsupported by specific references to empirical information, scientific authorities, or explanatory information. Among the deficiencies of the FEIR are the following:

Fails to identify the gas and power transmission lines that transect the site in its discussion of Hazards and Hazardous Materials.

Ignores the fact that students within the development area immediately west of the Project site and within the City of Antioch, will attend BUSD schools along with students within the Specific Plan Area, and contains no information regarding the proposed school site at Bridle Gate for which the City has been preparing a separate environmental document.

Defers analysis of water quality impacts by calling for policies to require discretionary projects to integrate best management practices and natural features to the greatest
extent feasible.

Fails to confirm in its discussion of Biological Resources, whether a Planning Survey Report has been prepared for the Project as required by the City's ordinance implementing the Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan Program.

Fails to discuss or consider new information regarding the presence of abandoned oil and gas wells and facilities.

In the area of Transportation and Traffic:

O Fails to adequately consider the increased traffic volumes that will be generated by the Project given the connectivity in the circulation network, particularly the Project's impacts on roadways and intersections to the south of the Project area. In particular the FEIR fails to adequately account for and consider traffic through the proposed commercial area to the school site within the Bridle Gate project area, for which the City has already undertaken separate environmental review, and fails to study intersections within the Bridle Gate project that will be impacted by the Project.
Fails to incorporate mitigation measures requiring fair-share contribution to a mitigation fund that is part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the City commits itself to implementing, as required under CEQA.

O Fails to provide adequate mitigation for impacts that will foreseeably result from
cumulative conditions.

o Ignores the request of the California Department of Transportation for an analysis of the intersections at the Lone Tree Way/SR 4 South Ramps (#9) and Lone Tree Way/SR 4 North Ramp-Jeffrey Way (#10) that demonstrate that impacts will be fully mitigated.

Despite the extensive comments, concerns and new information raised in our letters (and supported by comments on the DEIR submitted by the California Department of Transportation and the State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources), the Staff Report provides no discussion of these issues. Instead, the Staff Report summarily states that "the Planning Commission considered the comments made and correspondence received and then deliberated" prior to adopting resolutions recommending certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project. For purposes of your consideration, the Staff Report simply concludes, without discussion, that no new significant environmental impacts or issues, beyond those already covered in the Draft EIR for the PA-1 Specific Plan, were raised during the comment period for the DEIR.
The City continues to improperly defer conducting the level of environmental review required by CEQA by preparing a program EIR for the Specific Plan that purports to tier from the program EIR for the General Plan Update, neither of which EIRs provide the requisite analysis of potential impacts.
Accordingly, we request that you direct Staff to revise and recirculate the EIR to address the deficiencies outlined above and described in our prior correspondence.

P 18. The proposed project will be located on a 151-acre Preserve in the Southeast portion of
2| Laguna Beach. The Project includes the closure of an unauthorized 843 linear foot trail segment

3 and restoration of 0.55 acres of habitat area disturbed by unauthorized trail modifications.
4 19. These unauthorized activities - mountain biking and the creation of mountain biking
5 trails - occurred in sensitive habitat areas that qualify as environmentally sensitive areas.
6 20. In April 2015, the 151-acre parcel was purchased by OCTA to serve as a mitigation site to

7 offset potential impacts from thirteen freeway improvement projects covered by Orange County
8 Measure M2.

9 21. The Preserve features a variety of sensitive habitats, including chaparral, grassland, and
10 coastal sage scrub. It is currently managed by OCTA. As Preserve Manager, they are responsible
11 for the implementation of management and monitoring tasks in the Preserve.
12 22. In order to carry out the Project, OCTA was required to obtain two discretionary permits;
13 1) a Design Review Permit pursuant to the Laguna Beach Municipal Code; and 2) a Coastal
14 Development Permit (CDP) because the project is located in the Coastal Zone and is defined as
15 I'development' pursuant to the Coastal Act.
16 23. In July of 2019, OCTA applied for a CDP from the California Coastal Commission
17 ("CCC") for the Project. This was done directly to the CCC as the location of the Project is
18 within the direct coastal development permitting jurisdiction of the state agency.
19 24. On September 11, 2019, the project was approved by the CCC subject to the applicant's
20 conformance to local government requirements for discretionary permits. The CCC has no
21 jurisdiction over permitting other than CDPs and the City requires a discretionary Design
22 Review Permit for Habitat Restorations. (LBMC $25.05.040(B)(1)(n)).
23 25. On October 3, 2019, OCTA submitted a Development Review Application for the Project
24 to the City of Laguna Beach for the Project.

25 26. LBMC Chapter 25.05.040(F)(8) states that 'Applications for design review approval
26 constitute applications for a "permit" as that term currently is used in California Government
27 Code Section 65009(c)(1), and as hereafter may be amended.
28 27. The City Planning Commission received public comments on the proposed issuance of the 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F changed and advanced to a second reading and adoption on May 1, 2012.

2 34. The Habitat Restoration Guidelines (Topic M: Reports) require that based on the
3 monitoring of the site, the Restoration Professional will prepare and submit to the Community
or more frequently if appropriate, a report on the progress and 4 Development Director annually,

5 current status of the habitat restoration. The reports should include a graphic of the restoration
6 area limits and representative photographs. The reports should also evaluate the habitat based on
7 the initial standards for success, and they should recommend any modifications to the Plan that

8 may help to speed or to improve the process of restoration. The City's approval did not require

9 the preparation or submittal of annual reports.
10 35. The Habitat Restoration Guidelines (Topic N: Acceptance of Work) require the submittal
11 of a letter from the Restoration Professional certifying 5 that, based on the 5 criteria set out in the
12 Habitat Restoration Plan, the habitat has been successfully restored and can be expected to be
13 self-maintaining and that temporary irrigation systems have been removed before the City may
14 accept the restoration. The City's approval did not require any final acceptance of the restoration.
15 36. On December 17, 2019, Petitioner submitted an appeal of the Planning Commission's
16 decision to the City Council and paid a fee a of $748.00. A hearing before the Council was
17 scheduled for January 21, 2020.
18 37. On January 7, 2020, Petitioner received an email from the City Clerk stating that the
19 appeal could not be processed because Petitioner does not own property within 300 feet of the
20 project site (LBMC $25.05.070).
21 38. On January 7, 2020, Petitioner testified at City Council Public Comment informing the
22 Council of the refusal of the appeal and requesting the Council direct staff to reconsider the
23 project pursuant to LBMC 12.18. There was no response from Council.
24 39. On January 20, 2020, Petitioner sent an email to the Council with a copy of the appeal and
25 another plea to reconsider the project pursuant to LBMC 12.18.

Title 12 TREES AND VEGETATION

Chapter 12.18 PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF NATIVE VEGETATION
12.18.010 Intent and purpose.
Laguna Beach possesses delicately balanced native ecosystems, which are distinct and valuable natural resources. The preservation and protection of the city's native vegetation and natural hillsides is essential to the economic, social, ecological and aesthetic well-being for property owners and residents. The Laguna Beach native plant communities have intrinsic value in supporting wildlife and biological diversity, and in contributing to stream, groundwater, and ocean water quality. The purpos of this chapter is to provide regulations for the protection, preservation and, where removed or damaged without authorization, restoration of native vegetation and the viability of native species and plant communities. It is also the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish penalties for the unpermitted damage or removal of native vegetation and to establish a procedure for the restoration of such damaged or removed native vegetation. (Ord. § 1566 § 1, 2012).

12.18.020 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following words shall have the meaning set forth in this section:
(a) "Habitat, high value" means areas of vegetation as defined and described in Topic 8 (Vegetation and Wildlife Resources) of the Open Space/Conservation Element of the city's general plan and as inventoried and depicted on Biological Resources Values maps contained therein as "High" habitat value.
(b) "Habitat, moderate value" means areas of vegetation as defined and described in Topic 8 (Vegetation and Wildlife Resources) of the Open Space/Conservation Element of the city's general plan as "Moderate" habitat value.
(c) "Habitat, very high value" means areas of vegetation as defined and described in Topic 8 (Vegetation and Wildlife Resources) of the Open Space/Conservation Element of the city's general plan and as inventoried and depicted on Biological Resources Values maps contained therein as "Very High" habitat value.
(d) "Native vegetation" means a native plant, shrub, tree and grass, other than noxious weeds, that is indigenous to the coastal inland areas of southwest California and that reasonably could have been expected to naturally occur on site. Examples of these types of vegetation are described and included in detail in Topic 8 (Vegetation and Wildlife Resources) of the Open Space/Conservation Element of the city's general plan. (Ord. 1566 § 1, 2012).

12.18.030 Applicability.
(a) This chapter shall apply to: (1) all undeveloped parcels; (2) undeveloped portions of developed parcels that contain mapped moderate value habitat, high value habitat, very high value habitat and/or riparian habitat as defined, described or depicted in the city's general plan; and (3) developed parcels with designated open space. Of specific concern are land areas that are located within the residential/hillside protection zoning district, the open space zoning district, hillside areas, coastal bluffs and land areas that contain or are located adjacent to land containing mapped moderate value habitat, high value habitat or very high value habitat.
(b) This chapter is not intended to rescind or impair the implementation of any site-specific city land use, development or subdivision approvals and/or any covenants or deed restrictions in effect prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. To the maximum extent permitted, however, where this chapter and any such approval, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, the more stringent restrictions for

(1) Daily accrual of civil fines associated with the issuance of an administrative citation pursuant to
Section 1.15.070(a).
(2) Withholding of the issuance of final building permits for a pending project until the approved
restoration plan is successfully implemented.
(3) Suspension or revocation of project-related building permits and other entitlements or approvals
issued for the property.
(4) Assessment of city costs associated with restoration of the disturbed areas through nuisance
abatement action or similar proceeding.
(5) Penalties as prescribed in Section 1.04.025(B). (Ord. 1566 § 1, 2012).

View the mobile version.

F. Salvage of On-Site Materials

If the upper soil profile is still partially intact, it may contain seeds and mycorhizzal fungi. Such soil should be protected from further disturbance and incorporated into the restoration plan. If
biomass removed from the site has not been discarded, the Restoration Professional can consider
its use as a repository of seeds and mulch, taking care to first eliminate invasives. As a potential supplement or substitute to native mulch, weed-free rice straw may be applied. The Restoration
Professional may also consult with the Community Development Department to see whether legally removed soil and native plants from a different site might be available for transfer to and
use on the restoration site.

G. Source of Plants

A successional strategy - based on using local seeds in conjunction with native container plants--- should, to the extent feasible, be the basis of the restoration as this is more likely to establish a
whole community restoration habitat than restoration relying solely upon container plants. To the extent that nursery-grown plants in containers are to be used, the plants should be grown from seeds or cuttings collected from areas as close as practicable to the site. The Restoration
Professional shall specify the source of seeds and plants. If hydroseeding is used, the ratio of
seed to wood fiber and the quantities of each will be determined by the Restoration Professional and the brand of tackifer specified.

H. Irrigation
To the extent possible, preference shall be given to utilizing the natural rainfall. To the extent that irrigation may be needed to establish new vegetation, the Plan should clearly specify the type of irrigation system and the required watering schedule. This may include hand watering or low impact watering. In general, potential irrigation use should mimic natural rainfall patterns and be used judiciously to simulate an average to an above average rainy season. Summer irrigation should be minimal. To verify the restoration site is self-sustaining, temporary irrigation should be phased out at least one to two years before the maintenance and monitoring program is complete.

I. Planting Schedule
In general, initial planting is best done in the fall or early winter to coincide with the rainy season and growing season of local plants. However, in special cases, such as when exposed soils on slopes may need immediate protection or where a site is the nesting place of an endangered species, other planting times may be appropriate. Use of local biomass for mulching and punching can be accomplished at any time. Technical factors, such as the need to collect or germinate local seed, may also affect the implementation schedule. The Plan should include an explicit schedule for planting and seeding of all species to be used on the site.

UNPERMITTED NATIVE VEGETATION REMOVAL
CODE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE

The Code Enforcement Division of the Laguna Beach Community Development Department will respond quickly to the unauthorized destruction of habitat to halt further violation.

The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a Cease and Desist order if needed to halt further
unauthorized removal of vegetation.
The Code Enforcement Officer should instruct the contractor, the person responsible for removing the vegetation, or the onsite representative of the owner that it is important to retain or recover the disturbed biological materials and any removed soils as they contain materials valuable to a restoration. If the disturbed materials have been hauled away already, they should be redirected back to the site if this is possible. Persons responsible for removing the vegetation will be instructed where on the site to stockpile the material.

The Code Enforcement Officer should determine which contractors, landscapers or workers performed the removal so that they can be informed and educated about the City's policy. This will prevent these companies or individuals from assisting with an illegal habitat removal in the future. The onsite representatives of the owner or contractor should be given the City's policy on removal of native habitat, and any questions they have should be answered, so that the policy is clearly understood.
The Code Enforcement Officer shall visit the site and summarize the visit in a report including: the property address; the name of the property owner; the date and time of the complaint; the date and time of the site visit; whether plant material was left on site; the destination if material was hauled away; the names of contractor or workers on site, if any; any explanation by the owner or a contractor or worker; rough drawing of the disturbed area; and relevant other information deemed relevant by the Code Enforcement Officer.
The report should be directed to the City's Community Development Director.
