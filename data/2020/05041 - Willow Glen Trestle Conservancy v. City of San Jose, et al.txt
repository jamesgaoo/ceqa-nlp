First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner Willow Glen Trestle Conservancy alleges:

2 Introduction
3
1.
4 The Willow Glen Trestle Conservancy brings this mandamus action in

5 the public interest regarding the enforcement of a conservation easement

6 encompassing the evocative, century-old Willow Glen Trestle. The Trestle is listed in

7 the California Register of Historical Resources and its demolition would have a
8
significant environmental impact.
9

10 2. The City acquired the Trestle property from the Union Pacific Railroad

11 Company to serve as part of the pending Three Creeks Pedestrian Trail. The County

12 of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority substantially
13

14 funded the acquisition of the Trestle property. The City as grantor to the County and

15 the Authority recorded a conservation easement over the Trestle property in

16 perpetuity in December 2011, on the same date that the City acquired the property,

17 to preserve, protect, and manage "for the use and enjoyment of all people ... a
18 network of trails that will facilitate public access to outstanding, scenic recreational
19
codified in the California
20 areas." The easement further recites that its purpose, as

21 Civil Code, is to "retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical,

22 agricultural, forested, or open-space condition."

23 3. The basis for this mandamus action, inter alia, is the easement's
24

25 prohibition against alteration of the Trestle site, including via a project involving

26 erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of native vegetation,

27 without "written approval" and review and comment by the County and the Open

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Space Authority. The easement anticipates California Environmental Quality Act

2 (CEQA) review for the Three Creeks Trail at the City's expense.

3 4. The Conservancy's members have been devoted advocates for many
4

5 trails in Santa Clara County. Many are Willow Glen residents and successfully

6 pursued the listing of the Trestle on the California Register and are devoted to its

7 safe and economically feasible adaptive reuse for the Three Creeks Trail.

8 Conservancy members first learned of the existence of the conservation easement in
9

10 late 2019. In December 2019, Conservancy founder Larry Ames notified the City,

11 County, and Authority of the group's awareness of the easement's protective terms

12 and requested notice of compliance. No response was received.

13 5. On June 15, 2020, Dr. Ames visited the Trestle site. The City's lead
14 engineer for the Trestle demolition, Yoshi Yano, was present and informed him that
15

16 the City intended to proceed with demolition on Thursday June 18, 2020. Following

17 the filing of the petition in this case, the City did begin demolition even after TRO

18 proceedings in this Court had occurred with the Deputy City Attorney representing
19

20 to the Court that no demolition was anticipated to begin before Monday June 22,

21 and that the attorney would notify the Court otherwise. Damage to the Trestle is

22 already significant but as of the evening of June 18 the Conservancy is informed and

23 believed that the damage so far is irreparable. Counsel for the Conservancy has

24 requested the City to confirm that no further demolition will proceed pending the
25

26 Court's ruling on the TRO, but no such response has been provided.

12

13 6. CEQA is a citizen-enforced statute, and the Conservancy urgently seeks

14 a peremptory writ. The City, County, and Authority must comply with the terms of

15 the conservation easement before disturbing the Trestle or native vegetation at the
16

17 site and must comply with CEQA in doing so. Because demolition would cause

18 significant environmental impact, if the County and Authority consider approval of

19 a demolition project, CEQA compliance must take the form of an EIR in light of the

20 Trestle's recent listing in the California Register of Historic Places.

7. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

26 agencies, and the Trestle itself are located within the County of Santa Clara.

Parties

8.
3 The Willow Glen Conservancy is an unincorporated association formed in

4 the public interest in 2018. The Conservancy is devoted to the preservation and

5 rehabilitation of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy's members include

6 community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the historic and
7

8 aesthetic qualities of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy brings this petition on

9 behalf of all others similarly situated too numerous to be named and brought before

10 this Court as petitioners.

11 9. Respondent City of San José is the governmental body who is the grantor
12

13 in the subject conservation easement. The City through the respondent Public Works

14 Department is proceeding with a project to demolish the Trestle without complying

15 with the terms of the easement.

16 10. Real parties in interest County of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Valley
17

18 Open Space Authority aka the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority are

19 governmental bodies and grantees to the subject conservation easement. During the

20 course of discovery in this action, if all parties and the Court agree that the County and
21 the Authority are not indispensable parties, the Conservancy may choose to dismiss
22 them from this action. Alternatively, if the County and the Authority are instead
23

24 determined to be appropriate respondent parties, the Conservancy may amend this

25 petition to correct their status.

26 11. Does 1 through 10 are named as respondents and real parties in interest

27 because there are no private applicants who sought and received approval for the
28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge Project or for demolition of the Willow Glen

2 Trestle, and true names and capacities are currently unknown. If true names and

3 capacities become known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.

7 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

8

9 General Allegations

10 Willow Glen Trestle
11

12 13. The Willow Glen Trestle was built by Western Pacific Railroad when it

13 was a rival to the dominant Southern Pacific Railroad. Following World War I, when

14 Western Pacific was cash-strapped and looking for freight income it built the
15 undersized Willow Glen Trestle that forced trains to operate very slowly, under 10
16

17 miles an hour. Its design and construction in 1921 reflected the unique conditions of a

18 time and place: the post-World War I materials' shortage, Western Pacific's economic

19 constraints, and the demand for quick service by new canneries in Willow Glen and
20 across San José.
21

22 14. For decades, the Southern Pacific (SP) railroad tracks had followed 4th

23 Street right through the center of San José. When that railroad's franchise expired at the

24 turn of the twentieth century, the city began pressuring SP to relocate its tracks. The
25 State Railroad Commission recommended that SP loop around the City and share
26

27 tracks with Western Pacific. However, because of the undersized design of the Trestle,

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

this was infeasible. SP built its own crossing of Los Gatos Creek - the bridge near San

2 Carlos Street that is still in use today.

15. The Willow Glen Trestle was strong enough only to carry freight for trains
4
that ran "dead slow." This caused traffic congestion and led to the "grade separation"

6 movement and the eventual incorporation of the Town of Willow Glen.

7 16. It took some years for SP to build its tracks around San José, and in the

8 meantime Western Pacific served the area's many canneries. The route became Western
9

10 Pacific's "cash cow" and enabled the railroad to become profitable and expand its

11 operations. By the 1930s, Western Pacific had a network of lines traversing the Bay

12 Area eastward across the Sierras, providing an alternative to the SP monopoly.

13 17. If the Willow Glen Trestle had been just a "common trestle," Western
14
Pacific would not have developed a lucrative cannery business, SP's dominance would
15
16 likely have been unchallenged, and the area might have developed very differently.

17

18 Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge Project

19 18. For decades, the members of the Conservancy have volunteered to benefit
20 the Los Gatos Creek Trail and Three Creeks Trail, and as part of that effort worked
21 with City planners to incorporate the Willow Glen Trestle into the trail network.
22

23 The Conservancy provided information to planners and government officials about the

24 Trestle and railroad rights-of way, seeking grants so that the City could acquire them

25 for the Three Creeks Trail and its connection to the Los Gatos Creek Trail.

26 19. In January 2014, the City proposed a mitigated negative declaration for a
27

28 new Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge project, including demolition of the City-

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 owned Willow Glen Trestle and replacement with a prefabricated single-span steel

2 truss bridge on the same alignment. The City Council approved the project, refusing

3 the Conservancy's requests for preparation of an EIR despite expert evidence of the
4

5 Trestle's historicity. Two members voted against the mitigated negative declaration

6 and against the project, expressing grave concerns about the approval process.

7 20. Following project approval, the Friends filed a mandamus petition seeking

8 preparation of an EIR. Although the petition was initially granted by this Court and a
9

10 writ issued, the mitigated negative declaration was ultimately upheld following

11 reversal by the Sixth District Court of Appeal in Friends of the Willow Glen Trestle v. City

12 of San José (2017) 2 Cal.App.5th 457.

13 21. While the City's appeal was pending, it prepared and certified an EIR
14 addressing the demolition of the Trestle in 2014. The EIR analyzed the Trestle and
15

16 as part of the trail project was concluded that its rehabilitation for adaptive reuse

17 practical, safe, and economically feasible. However, the EIR also concluded that
18 demolition would have no significant environmental impacts since the Trestle was not

19 historic. The Conservancy did not file a legal challenge because it was not yet ripe;
20

21 challenges to the sufficiency of an EIR must be made after a project is approved in

22 reliance on that CEQA document. The City did not reconsider its approval of the
23 Trestle demolition project following certification of the EIR; it appeared that the reason

24 the City did not do so is that it would have made its appeal moot.
25

26

27

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 California Register Listing

2 22. While the legal cases were pending, the Friends successfully nominated
3

4 the Trestle to the California Register. The Trestle was listed in the Register in 2017 by

5 the California Historical Resources Commission over the City's objections. The City

6 filed and lost a legal challenge in San Francisco Superior Court to set aside the listing.

7

8 Conservation Easement

9 23. The City acquired the Trestle property from the Union Pacific Railroad
10 Company to serve as part
11 of the pending Three Creeks Pedestrian Trail. The County

12 and the Authority substantially funded the acquisition of the Trestle property. The City

13 as grantor to the County and the Authority recorded a conservation easement over the

14 Trestle property in perpetuity in December 2011, on the same day that the City
15

16 acquired the property, to preserve, protect, and manage "for the use and enjoyment of

17 all people ... a network of trails that will facilitate public access to outstanding, scenic

18 recreational areas." The easement further recites that its purpose, as codified in the

19 California Civil Code, is to "retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical,

20 agricultural, forested, or open-space condition."
21
24.
22 The easement prohibits physical alteration of the Trestle site, including via

23 a project involving erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of

24 native vegetation, without "written approval" and review and comment by the County

25 and the Open Space Authority. The easement anticipates CEQA review for the Three
26
Creeks Trail at the City's expense.
27

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Legal Proceedings

2 25. In 2018, the Conservancy filed a CEQA mandamus action against the City
3

4 relating to its application for and approval of a Streambed Alteration Agreement (SAA)

5 with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The City had approved an SAA in

6 2014 as required to proceed with the demolition of the Trestle, but it expired in 2017.

7 The City did not prepare EIR review as requested by the Conservancy despite the
8 interim listing of the Trestle in the State Register. The import of the change in
9

10 circumstances is that demolition of the Trestle is now confirmed to have a significant a

11 environmental impact. The Conservancy's mandamus petition was denied in June

12 2018, after which the Sixth District Court of Appeal issued a temporary stay of

13 demolition followed by a writ of supersedeas in July 2018. The Court of Appeal
14

15 thereafter affirmed the judgment in published ruling in Willow Glen Trestle
16 Conservancy v. City of San José (2020) Cal.App.5th __. The current supersedeas writ

17 expired on June 17, 2020, when the appellate opinion became final.

18 26. Despite many requests over many months, the City did not inform the
19

20 Conservancy or its counsel whether or not it contends that it has complied with the

21 conservation easement's mandates. It now has provided a letter from an open space

22 planner indicating the Open Space Authority's review and comment on the proposed

23 demolition project, but has not provided evidence of any written approvals.
24
27. On Monday, June 15, 2020, Conservancy founder Dr. Larry Ames visited
25

26 the Trestle site and observed City personnel present, including Yoshi Yano, the lead

27 engineer for the Trestle demolition project, who informed him that the City intended to

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 proceed with demolition on June 17. Indeed, the Trestle demolition began on that date,

2 both unopposed stream diversion and needless damage to the Trestle itself.

3 28. The Conservancy has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
4

5 ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate,

6 severe, and irreparable harm to San José residents and city resources via the demolition

7 of the historic Willow Glen Trestle. The City has the capacity to correct its violations of

8 law but refuses to do so.

9

10 Failure to Perform a Mandatory Duty

11 29. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

12 30. The City failed to perform a mandatory duty, abused its discretion, and
13

14 Ifailed to act in the manner required by law in failing to date to comply with the

15 mandates of the conservation easement before moving forward with the imminent

16 demolition of the Trestle on the basis of the 2014 Mitigated Negative Declaration.

17 31. The conservation easement prohibits physical alteration of the Trestle site,
18 including erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of native
19

20 vegetation, without "written approval" and review and comment by the County and
21 the Open Space Authority. The City has not obtained written approval nor adequate

22 review, comment, or approval by the County and the Authority for the demolition of

23 the historic Trestle, which would result in a significant environmental impact that has
24

25 not been studied or mitigated. Due to the significant impact that would attend

26 demolition, an EIR process may be required to inform the discretion of the County and
27 the Authority if they consider or proceed with approval of the demolition, since that

28

First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 would have a significant environmental impact triggering supplemental CEQA review
2 based on the 2017 listing of the Trestle on the California Register. The conservation

3 easement anticipates CEQA review at the expense of the City.
4

5 Wherefore, petitioner requests:

6
1.
7 That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering respondent

8 City of San José, et al., not to proceed with the Three Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge

9 Project and demolition of the Willow Glen Trestle and to refrain from further

10 consideration until the City fully complies with its obligations under the terms of the

11 2011 conservation easement;
12

13 2. That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary

14 injunction enjoining the City respondents and their agents and employees from any

15 and all physical actions in furtherance of the Three Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge

16 Project or that would physically alter the site or the Willow Glen Trestle while this
17

18 petition is pending, including but not limited to grading, demolition, pre-construction,

19 or construction activities of any kind;

20 3. For petitioner's costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5;

21 and

22
4.
23 For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
