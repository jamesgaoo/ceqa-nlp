1 Petitioners' appeal and approved Medicinal Healing LLC's ("Medicinal Healing")
2 Conditional Use Permit ("CUP") for the construction of a new two-story,
3 approximately 10,834 sq. ft building (the "Project") at the southwest corner of 36555
4 Bankside Drive, Cathedral City, CA 92234 (the "Property"), and the City's finding
5 the Project is exempt from environmental review under the California

6 Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et. seq. ("CEQA").

7 2. The Project will house a new cannabis business (cultivation,
8 manufacturing, and distribution) and abut an existing approximately 13,608 sq. ft.
9 single-story building, constructed in 1990, located on the Property, currently occupied
10 by Petitioners, and operating as a cannabis business (cultivation site).
9 11 3. Pursuant to the City's Municipal Code ("CCMC") requirements, the JOISINV9 N38NJY 8NV8INI3M 17V) SNIX1T3 Facsimile: 310.746.4499 +9006 EjwoHed Los Angeles, 12 Property requires, among other things, a total of thirty-four (34) off-street parking
10345 W. Olympic Bivd. 13 spaces to support both the existing building and the Project.
14 4. However, the Project, as approved, will block access through the
101P9PLOLE Telephone: 15 Property to the portion of the parking area needed to fulfill the off-street parking
16 requirements, and the Property has no other legal access. As such, the Project
17 cannot provide the required thirty-four (34) off-street parking spaces.
18 5. In addition, the City approved the Project's CUP based on the premise

19 that the Project qualifies for the Class 32 categorical exemption specified in
20 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section No. 15332, and is therefore exempt
21 from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub.
22 Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"). Yet, the Project will have significant
23  effects on traffic and air quality, in part, due to the removal of certain accessways
24 and the additional truck traffic required to support a second cannabis cultivator on
25 the Property. The Class 32 categorical exemption cannot apply to the Project.

26 6. As further alleged herein, the City did not proceed in the manner required
27 by law in approving the CUP, failed to comply with CEQA, and the decision to approve
28 the Project and CUP was not supported by substantial evidence.

1 BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROPERTY

2 18. On or about August 26, 2016, Mayan, as lessor, entered into a lease (the

3 "Lease") with Desert Hospitality Management, LLC ("Desert"), as lessee.

4 19. The Lease defined the "Premises" as "t]hat certain real property,
5 including all improvements therein or to be provided by Lessor under the terms of this
6 Lease, and commonly known as 36-555 Bankside Drive, Cathedral City, located in the

7 County of Riverside, State of California," and generally described as a single-tenant
8 building approximately 13,648 square feet in size.

9 20. The Premises includes parking for use by Petitioners and their visitors
10 a and a large loading area in the rear of the Premises for Petitioners to load trucks.
S 11 21. The term of the Lease is ten (10) years, which commenced in 2016, and 3OISIUVE NIENY ANVAINEM IIV) SNXT3 66++'9t2'0 L€ :Ojjwisoed 00P1940l8 Telephone: +9006 ejwome; 'sajebuy so7 12 Kings Garden has an option to extend the term for two additional ten-year terms.
10345 W. Olympic Blvd. 13 22. On or about January 1, 2018, the Lease was amended (the
14 "Amendment"). Through the Amendment, Desert assigned the Lease to Kings
15 Garden, LLC, which assumed all of Desert's rights, interests, and obligations under
16 the Lease. Kings Garden, LLC, in turn, entered into a written sublease with CK for
17 the entire Premises.

18 23. As expressly authorized under the Lease, CK uses the Premises for the
19 licensed, legal cultivation of cannabis.

20 24. On or about October 31, 2019, Kings Garden, LLC merged into Kings
21 Garden. The surviving entity from that merger is Kings Garden. The term "Kings
22 Garden" shall refer to both Kings Garden, LLC and Kings Garden Inc.

23 25. In 2019, Steve Aguilar, on behalf of Mayan and Medicinal Healing,
24 notified Petitioners of the Project and Petitioners expressed their objections to Steve

25 Aguilar.

26 26. On or about November 19, 2019, Kings Garden filed an action entitled
27 Kings Garden Inc., et al. v. Mayan Properties, LLC, Superior Court of California,
28 County of Riverside, Palm Springs Court, Case No. PSC 1908429 (the "Lawsuit"). The

5 1610136v6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Lawsuit alleges that the Project would deprive Kings Garden of its property rights.
Under the Lease, Kings Garden leases, pays rent, and has a right to exclusive
3 possession and use of the entire 42,596 sq. ft. Property. Mayan, through the Project, 2

4 seeks to unlawfully deprive Kings Garden of possession and use of a large portion of
5 its own leased property and operate a competing cannabis business on the Property.

27. The Lawsuit seeks to enjoin Medicinal Healing from constructing the
Project on the basis that the Project violates the terms of the Lease. The Lawsuit is
8 ongoing, but it does not affect the filing or adjudication of this Petition, which
9 challenges the City's actions.

20 nevertheless recommended that the Planning Commission approve the design of the
21 Project.

23 aware that the City Planning Commission's would be considering the CUP for the 22

8 within certain zoning districts of the City, subject to a conditional use permit, the City

The proposed 10,834 square-foot building will require a 18 to similar uses, concluding that:

total of 13 parking spaces based on the floor plan for the new cannabis business and the existing building requires 20 19 parking spaces based on the previously [sic] CUP approved floorplan. Therefore, the site would require a 21
total of 32 parking spaces; however, the site plan proposes 34 spaces including two (2) ADA accessible 22
spaces. (Emphasis added.) 23
In addition, a there are a total.of four (4) loading spaces (10 24 ft by 25 ft) proposed on the site plan; however, only one loading space per building is required. 25

that:

5 two buildings. (Emphasis added.)
(Staff Report, City Planning Commission, July 16, 2020, 6 pg. 6)

7 39. The Project plans depict the thirty-four (34) parking spaces in three
8 separate areas - 12 spaces are located in the Property's southern side (the "South
9 Yard"), 7 spaces in the Property's northern side yard (the "North Yard"), and 15

13 40. Although the Project plans show the required off-street parking, the
14 Project's design prevents legal access to the 22 spaces located in the North and Rear
15 Yards.
16 41. Contrary to the statement in the City's staff report, the Property does not
17 have two legal driveways. Of the "two existing driveways," only one is on the Property.
18 The driveway located on the southern portion of the Property (the "Southern
19 Driveway"), which provides access to the 12 parking spaces on the South Yard, is
20 within the Property. However, the driveway immediately to the north of the Property's
21 northern boundary line (the "Northern Driveway") is not located on the Property; it
22 is located on 36425 Bankside Drive ("36425 Property").
23 42. The parking spaces located in the North and Rear Yards are not
24 accessible from the Southern Driveway because the building proposed by the Project
25 blocks circulation to the Rear Yard from the Southern Driveway.
26 43. The Project plans incorrectly assume that the Northern Driveway may be
27 used to access the 22 parking spaces located in the North and Rear Yard. However,
28 there is no recorded easement giving the Property ingress and egress rights over the

27 located on a site adequate in size and shape to accommodate the Project, and will create
substantial impacts to the public streets. 28

1610136v6 9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

43. The Project proposes the construction of a new building on the Property
2 to be occupied by a second cannabis cultivator. However, the Property is not large

3 enough to accommodate the new building and the second cannabis cultivator because

4 (i) there will not be sufficient loading areas or parking for two separate cannabis

5 cultivators, (ii) a second cannabis cultivator would preclude the City from effectively

6 enforcing the compliance conditions the CCMC requires for all cannabis businesses,

7 and (iii) it would undermine the safety of the existing operator, CK.

8 44. First, CCMC section 9.108.080.A.1. requires a cannabis business to
ensure that "odor generated inside the cannabis business that is distinctive to its
10 operation is not detected outside the cannabis business . . .." Failure to comply with
/11 BOISI8V9 NHENJY 8NVALNIEM 17VX SNDT3 11 such a condition constitutes grounds for the City to revoke the cannabis businesses'
+9006 ejwoflec Los Angeles, 12 conditional use permit. The Project's location adjacent to the existing building and
PAI8 DIduÃO *M SPCOL Telephone: 310.746.4400 • Facsimile: 310.746.4499 13 cannabis operation will prevent the City from effectively determining and citing
14 potential violating cultivators.

15 45. Second, the Project will undermine the security of CK's business
16 operations, which currently include monitoring of all visitors. If the Project proceeds,
17| strangers to CK's business - including contractors during construction of the Project,
18 Medicinal Healing employees, customers, suppliers, and other visitors - will routinely
19 enter the Property. This would substantially undermine CK's security, which is

20 essential to the proper functioning of CK's licensed business. CK's compromised
21 security, compounded with the additional cannabis cultivator at the Property, will
22 place a larger burden on the City's municipal police services. The Project is
23 detrimental to the safety and general welfare of the Property's neighborhood.

24 46. Third, although the Project plans depict truck loading docks, the City's
25 cannabis cultivation rules effectively prevent the use of these loading docks. As noted
26 above, CCMC section 9.108.080.A.1 requires that cannabis cultivators prevent
27 cannabis odors from being detected outside of the cultivation building. CK was
28 required to seal the doors to the truck loading docks to prevent air from escaping the

10 1510136v6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

building. As a result, CK (along with the majority of other cannabis cultivators in the
City) is prohibited from using the building's truck loading docks to load its cannabis
3 products onto shipping trucks. Instead, CK must seal the cannabis in special
4 packaging and manually load the packaged product into loading trucks parked in the 2

5 Rear Yard.
Because of the loading dock prohibition, CK employees park in the South 6

Yard (including the portion of the South Yard that will be occupied by the Project's
proposed building) SO that CK may use the Rear Yard for loading and unloading 47.

9 operations. The Project eliminates the area required for CK's loading and unloading 7

10 operations. Under the Project's plans, CK employees will need to relocate their cars 8

11 from the Rear Yard to the public streets to allow for the loading of cannabis onto 66pt9t40l8 :e|isoe 12 shipping trucks. This parking deficiency will cause congestion in the area and impact PAj8 pidwÃIo +9006 elwojeo Los Angeles, d11 30ISI8VE N3Sn3Y 9nVALNIEM1TVN SNDT3 13 traffic circulation in the Project vicinity. The size of the Property cannot accommodate

18 employee parking, and its ability to comply with conditions for use of the Premises.
19 Moreover, the removal of the Southern Driveway will jeopardize Petitioner's

CCMC section 9.72.010 requires that the streets and highways 20 conditional use permit for cannabis manufacturing.

22 surrounding the Project be designed and improved to support the Project. However, 49.

23 the Project will cause unnecessary impacts to parking by requiring CK employees to 21

24 park on City streets that are not designed to support such on-street parking. The
25 Project will detrimentally impact the Property's traffic circulation since the Property's
26 traffic would double to accommodate the operations of two competing cannabis
27 cultivators. The impacts would result in trucks idling on City streets while waiting to
28 enter and exit the Property. The stalled traffic, compounded with the additional trucks

11

needed to support a second cannabis cultivator at the Property, will create impacts to

2 the City's street traffic within the Project's vicinity that the City's streets were not

3 designed to accommodate, resulting in increased carbon dioxide emissions that will be
4 detrimental to the City's current air quality.

5 The Project Has Not Undergone the Required Environmental Review

6 Under CEQA

50. The City's Planning Commission found the Project qualifies for the Class

8 32 categorical exemption specified in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section

9 No. 15332, and therefore exempt from environmental review under CEQA. But the
10 Project does not qualify for the Class 32 categorical exemption.

20 Medicinal Healing's CUP and found the Project exempt from CEQA pursuant to
21 Section 15332, Class 32.

23 Commission decision to the City's City Council in accordance with CCMC section
24 9.72.080.A.

25 55. On September 9, 2020, the City Council considered Petitioners' appeal.
26 In response to the appeal issues, the City responded that, as to the Northern Driveway
27 issue, the City need not resolve such a dispute, and that if there is, in fact, no access
28 available, then the Property owner will be in violation of the CUP conditions. The City

1610136v6 12

2 Project, was not detrimental to existing uses, and will not impact traffic flow and
3 circulation on the Property. The City Council affirmed the City's Planning
4 Commission decision and approved the CUP.

5 EFFECT OF THE APPROVAL ON PETITIONERS

6 56. As described above, the Project will effectively remove current parking for
7 CK employees, overburden the Property, and potentially result in the revocation of

8 CK's cannabis license.

9 57. CK has, and continues to, operate a fully licensed cannabis cultivation

Telephone: 310.746.4400 • Facsimile: 310.746.4499 10 site. The City's approval of the Project will effectively impede CK's ability to perform

14 Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to CCP §1094.5

15 (Violations of the City's Municipal Code)

16 58. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates herein by this reference
17 each and every allegation set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 57 of this Petition, as
18 though fully set forth herein.

19 59. The CUP is inconsistent in several respects with the requirements of the
20 City's Municipal Code.

21 60. The City violated its Municipal Code by approving the CUP: (a) without
22 requiring the Project comply with the City's legally accessible parking requirements;

23 (b) without requiring conditions to resolve the enforcement challenges presented by
24 allowing two cannabis cultivators to occupy the same property in buildings that share
25  a common wall; (c) without adequately analyzing the potential for overconcentration

26 of cannabis cultivators in the area; (d) without adequately analyzing the increased
27 burden on City's municipal police services; (e) with deficient loading areas for the
28 Property's uses; and (f) without requiring conditions to resolve the Project's impacts

that will overburden City streets.

2 61. As a result of the above defects, Respondents did not proceed in the
3 manner required by law, and the decision to approve the Project and CUP was not
supported by substantial evidence. The City provides no valid justification.

5 62. Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies.

6 63. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate directing
7 Respondents to set aside the September 9, 2020 approval of the CUP.

12 forth in Paragraphs 1 through 63 of this Petition, as though fully set forth herein.
10345 W. Olympic PAI8 13 65. Respondents failed to respond adequately to Petitioners' comments
14 concerning the lack of environmental review of the Project and inapplicability of the
15 Class 32 CEQA Exemption. Petitioners' demonstrated that there is a reasonable
16 possibility that the Project will have significant effect on the environment due to the
17 unusual circumstances surrounding parking, circulation constraints, and the lack of
18 loading docks at the Property given the unique characteristics of cannabis cultivation.
19 These unusual circumstances differ from the general circumstances of project covered
20 by the Class 32 CEQA Exemption.

21 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING

22 66. On November 5, 2020, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioners, through
23 their counsel, served the City with notice of Petitioners' intention to immediately
24 commence a proceeding against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with
25 the Project. A copy of the letter providing such notice is attached to this Petition as
26 Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this reference. This letter satisfied Petitioners'
27 duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; 36555 Bankside Drive,
Cathedral City, CA 92234; Conditional Use Permit No. 19-013

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5,
Petitioners, Kings Garden Inc. and CK Endeavors, Inc., intend to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), among others, against the City of Cathedral City ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Riverside County Superior Court and will allege, among other things, that the City did not comply with CEQA when it approved the development project proposed at 36555 Bankside Drive ("Project"). Namely, the City improperly concluded that the Project qualified for a Class 32 categorical exemption and was therefore exempt from environmental review under CEQA. The Petition further alleges that the City did not proceed in the manner required by law, and the decision
to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more If specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, designation that the case is complex.
