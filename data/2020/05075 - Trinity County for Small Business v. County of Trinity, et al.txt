21 INTRODUCTION

22 Petitioner TRINITY COUNTY FOR SMALL BUSINESS ("Petitioner" or "TCSB")

23 respectfully petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

24 sections 1085 and 1094.5, and for a declaration of rights directed to Respondent COUNTY OF

25 TRINITY ("Respondent" or "County"), by and through the County Board of Supervisors, to

26 vacate its approval of the Grocery Outlet Project proposed to be located at 1155 Main Street,

27 Weaverville, California (*Project"). Specifically, TCSB asks the Court to direct Respondent to
28 set aside the conditional use permit ("CUP") and other entitlement issued to approve the Project,

1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P a require a legally compliant public review period for the environmental document as required by
2 the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.Res.C. §§21000, et. seq., hereafter "CEQA"), and
3 to prepare an Environmental Impact Report for the Project prior to re-considering the Project for
4 approval.
5 The County's actions in approving the Project on July 21, 2020, violate State and locall
6 laws and amount to a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate is necessary to remedy
7 the County's failure to adequately address the Project's environmental impacts, to ensure the 8 County complies with all applicable laws, including laws regarding notice and conduct of public 9

10 review periods, and to ensure proper review, disclosure, and mitigation of the potential

11 environmental impacts resulting from the approval and development of the Project pursuant to

12 CEQA. By this Petition, Petitioner represents the following:
PARTIES 13

14 1. Petitioner TRINITY COUNTY FOR SMALL BUSINESS is, and at all times

15 herein was, an unincorporated group of local residents, tax-payers, business owners, and/on

16 voters residing in Trinity County, California. TCSB was the appellant in the County's July 21,

17 2020 hearing on the Project.

18 2. Respondent COUNTY OF TRINITY is, and at all times herein mentioned was

19 political subdivision of the State of California. The County has a duty to comply with state law
20| requirements, including CEQA and State Planning and Zoning law when considering land use
21 requests.

22 3. Real Party in Interest BEST DEVELOPMENT GROUP, LLC (*Real Party") is,
23 and at all relevant times mentioned herein was, a California limited liability company with its
24 principal place of business located in Sacramento, California. Real Party is the only entity
25 identified on the County's Notice of Determination as the person carrying out the Project. TCSB
26 is informed, believes, and thereon alleges that Real Party applied for and received approval off 27 the Project.
28

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 4. TCSB does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate,
2 or otherwise, of those Respondents and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does 1 through
3 100 and 101 through 200, respectively. TCSB is informed and believes and thereon alleges that
4 said Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible for the adoption of,
5 imposition of, or administration of those laws, ordinances, regulations of which TCSB complains
6 herein. TCSB will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of the 7

8 fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest when such information has been
ascertained.
9
5.
10 TCSB is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each fictitiously named

11 Respondent and Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein

12 alleged.

13 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

14 RELEVANT MATERIAL FACTS

15 6. In or about 2019, Real Party submitted an application to Respondent requesting

16 several land use entitlements, the approval of which would allow Real Party to develop a

17 Grocery Outlet store, proposed to be located at 1155 Main Street, Weaverville, California (the

18 "Project"), identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers 002-100-61, 002-100-62, 002-100-63, and
19 002-100-42. Specifically, Real Party applied for: (1) a merger of parcels 002-100-42, 002-100-
20 61, and 002-100-62; (2) a lot line adjustment with parcel 002-100-63; and (3) a conditional use
21 permit ("CUP").
22 7. After preparing an Initial Study, the County determined that the Project could
23 have significant environmental impacts, and on that basis prepared a Mitigated Negative
24 Declaration ("MND") for public review.
25 8. On or about February 28, 2020, the County posted a Notice of Availability that
26

27 the MND would be "available for review at the Trinity County Department of Planning

28 weekdays 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M." The February 28, 2020 Notice of Availability further stated

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

that "[t]he public comment period begins on March 2, 2020 and will end on April 2, 2020 at 3:00
2 P.M.3

3 9. On March 20, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Governor Gavin
4 Newsom's Executive Order N-33-20, the Trinity County Department of Planning issued a
5 memorandum stating "[t]he office is closed to the public until further notice." In addition, on the
6 same date the County's Department of Planning webpage added text, which was bolded and
7 highlighted, which read "[o]ur office is closed to the public until further notice to limit any
8
potential exposure to COVID-19."
9
10.
10 The Trinity County Department of Planning office was closed to the public on

11 April 2, 2020. The County closed the MND public comment period on April 2, 2020, pursuant to

12 the February 28, 2020 Notice of Determination.

13 A. Planning Commission Meeting - April 23, 2020

14 11. On or about April 17, 2020, the County issued notice that the Project would be

15 considered at the April 23, 2020 Trinity County Planning Commission meeting. The County

16 stated on its website that the April 23, 2020 Planning Commission meeting was going to be

17 conducted entirely remotely, with a teleconference line for those wishing to speak and a live

18 YouTube stream for those wishing to view the meeting.

19 12. On or about April 21-23, 2020, TCSB members and representatives submitted
20 written comments objecting to (1) the County's failure to provide 10-day notice of the public
21 hearing on the Project, (2) the closure of the MND public comment period on April 2, 2020, and
22 (3) the County's failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report to study potential urban
23 decay impacts.
24 13. At the Planning Commission meeting on April 23, 2020, County staff
25 recommended the Planning Commission continue the hearing on the Project to the May 14, 2020
26 Planning Commission meeting so that staff could address the written comments.
27
14.
28 The YouTube stream was on a delay so that those on the conference line were
about 30 seconds ahead of those watching the YouTube stream. Those on the YouTube stream

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

were unable to hear any of the meeting, including public comments made over the teleconference
2 line or those made by the Planning Commission in person. The teleconference line was
congested and full of static.
4 15. Although the County stated clearly and plainly that the April 23, 2020 Planning
5 Commission hearing was to be entirely virtual, representatives of Real Party stated that the only
6 reason Real Party was not present in person was because of staff's recommendation to continue
7 the item and not because Real Party was excluded from attending in person. The landowner off 8

9 the Project site, Dana Ryan, was admitted to the meeting in-person, and offered public comment,

10 which was inaudible to everyone viewing the meeting remotely. The general public was not

11 permitted to attend the meeting in person.

12 16. After the brief public comment period, the Planning Commission voted 5-0 to

13 continue the hearing on the Project to the May 14, 2020 Planning Commission meeting. The

14 County subsequently cancelled the May 14, 2020 meeting, and continued all agenda items,

15 including the public hearing on the Project, to the June 4, 2020 Planning Commission meeting.

16 B. Planning Commission Meeting - June 4, 2020

17 17. At the Planning Commission meeting on June 4, 2020, County staff

18 recommended the Planning Commission adopt the MND and mitigation program and approve
19 the Project. The June 4, 2020 meeting had very limited availability for members of the public to
20 attend in person, but was largely held virtually. This time, the County established a zoom
21 videoconference along with the delayed YouTube stream.
22 18. Prior to and at the June 4, 2020 hearing, TCSB members submitted written
23 comments to the Planning Commission raising concerns that (1) by closing the MND public
24 review period on April 2, 2020, the County has not complied with the legal requirements of
25 CEQA; (2) a CUP should not issue because the County failed to make the Trinity County
26 General Plan available to the public for review to ensure the Project complies with its terms; and 27

28 (3) the County could not adopt the MND because the record contained substantial evidence of

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 fair argument that the Project would cause urban decay, a potentially significant physical
2 environmental impact that the County had failed to consider in the MND.
3 19. Various other community members submitted their own written concerns, noting
4 the already-impacted grocery economy in Weaverville and the urban decay already present in
5 vicinity of the Project, caused by the closure of Trinity Market.
6 20. At the public hearing on June 4, 2020, no member of the public made comment
7 via the Zoom video conference or telephone conference lines. One or more members of TCSB
8

9 were present on the Zoom video conference or telephone conference line and were unable to

10 make their desire to speak known due to technological errors with the County's virtual public

11 hearing program.

12 21. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning Commission voted 3-2 to approve

13 the Project. The two dissenting members of the Planning Commission expressed concern about

14 the potential unstudied urban decay impacts and the various ways in which the public had been

15 deprived of the ability to participate in the process to the extent required by law.

16 22. On June 9, 2020, five days after the Planning Commission approved the Project,

17 the Trinity County Department of Planning offices re-opened to the public. Within
18 approximately one week of the June 4, 2020 Planning Commission meeting, the Trinity County

19 General Plan was made accessible on the internet.

20 23. On or about June 16, 2020, TCSB members, through counsel, timely appealed the
21 Planning Commission's approval of the Project to the Board of Supervisors.
22 C. Appeal to Board of Supervisors - July 21, 2020
23 24. Prior to and at the July 21, 2020 public hearing on TCSB's appeal of the, TCSB
24 members submitted written comments to the Board of Supervisors raising concerns that (1) by
25 closing the MND public review period on April 2, 2020, the County has not complied with the
26

27 legal requirements of CEQA; (2) a CUP cannot issue because the Project is inconsistent with the

28 Trinity County General Plan; and (3) the County could not adopt the MND because the record
contained substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project would cause urban decay, a

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

potentially significant physical environmental impact from the Project that the County had not
2 studied.

3 25. Petitioner and its members submitted to the County the expert report of Dr. Phillip
4 King, professor of economics at San Francisco State University, which found that the Project is
5 likely to lead to store closures, food dessert in other parts of the County, and physical urban
6 decay impacts in Weaverville and the surrounding area.
7 26. Other members of the public submitted comments expressing concern over the
8 "urban blight" and "declining town centers" likely to be caused by the Project. 9
27.
10 At the public hearing on July 21, 2020, during the hearing on Petitioner's appeal!

11 Real Party submitted the report of urban planner Amy L. Herman, which concluded the Project

12 would not cause urban decay impacts. TCSB did not receive notice or a copy of this report, even

13 though Real Party indicated at the public hearing that the report had been submitted to County

14 staff the week prior, and thus had no opportunity to review or respond to the report.

15 28. At the close of the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to deny
16 TCSB's appeal.

17 29. On or about August 3, 2020, the County posted a Notice of Determination, which

18 referenced the Planning Commission's June 4, 2020 approval of the Project, but not the Board's

19 decision on the appeal on July 21, 2020.

20 II. STANDING, EXHAUSTION, AND RIPENESS
21 30. Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21177 Petitioner, through group members
22 and representatives, has satisfied any requirement to exhaust administrative remedies concerning
23 the Project. Petitioner timely appealed from the Planning Commission's June 4, 2020 approval
24 of the Project.
25 31. Members of TCSB commented on the Project and objected to the County's 26 failures at both the June 4, 2020 Planning Commission meeting and at its July 21, 2020 appeal 27 before the County Board of Supervisors. 28

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

32. Petitioner and its members and representatives presented evidence and arguments
2 that the County erred in (1) closing the MND public comment period on April 2, 2020, (2)
3 failing to study the likely significant urban decay impacts, an issue the Initial Study and all
4 environmental review completely ignored, and (3) approving the issuance of a conditional use
5 permit for the Project.
6 33. Petitioner and its members, as Trinity County taxpayers, residents, and business 7 owners, have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's full compliance with CEQA and all 8

9 other applicable laws in approving this Project.

34.
10 The County has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, its own

11 General Plan and zoning laws, and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.

12 35. These claims are ripe for review because the County Board of Supervisors has

13 taken a final action in denying Petitioner's appeal on the Project.

14 36. Petitioner, through its members, will be directly and substantially affected by the

15 adverse environmental impacts and land use change that may result from the Project.

16 37. Petitioner has standing to bring this action, as its members are residents,

17 taxpayers, and business owners in or around the Weaverville area of the County who will be

18 adversely affected by this Project and because they seek to compel a public duty in the form of

19 the County and Real Parties in Interest complying with State and local land use and
20 environmental laws.

21 38. Petitioner will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.5 by sending written notice of
22 this action to the County.
23 39. Petitioner will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure §
24 388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.
25 40. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary 26 course of law.
27
41.
28 A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and
Petitioner by County fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law in approving the

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Project. A clear and significant benefit will be independently conferred upon the general public
2 by the County fully satisfying the requirements of CEQA, and applicable general plan policies
3 and zoning laws. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement of a
4 mandatory duty. Petitioner, through its members, is vitally and beneficially interested in
5 assuring that the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by
6 Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that fundamental rules 7 of law would be affected.
8
42. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, 9 Government Code sections 65009, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 10

11 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside the MND and the

12 approval of the Land Use Permits.

13 43. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

14 arose in Trinity County where both the Project and the agency that approved the Project are

15 located.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Failure to Comply with Public Review Period for CEQA Document)
18 44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
19 in Paragraphs 1 through 43, above.
20 45. The County committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
21 the manner required by law in closing the public review period for the MND on April 2, 2020
22 when the Planning offices were closed to the public.
23 46. Pursuant to Rominger v. County of Colusa (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 960, the last 24

25 day of the public review period for a CEQA environmental document must fall on a day where

26 the lead agency's offices are open to the public.

47.
27 The County offices were closed to the public on April 2, 2020. The County

28 offices did not re-open to the public until June 9, 2020.

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 48. Petitioner was substantially prejudiced by the County's failure to provide a legally
2 compliant public review period for the MND.
3 49. The County a committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
4 the manner required by law when it closed the public review period for the MND on April 2,
5 2020.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
7 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report as
8 Required by CEQA)
50. 9 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

10 in Paragraphs 1 through 49, above.

11 51. Determination of whether an EIR is required for a project depends upon the "fain

12 argument" test. CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an EIR rather than a MND wheneven

13 it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence in the record that a project may have

14 significant environmental impact. If there is substantial evidence of such impact, contrary

15 evidence is not adequate to support a decision to dispense with an EIR.

16 52. The County received, from Petitioner and others, substantial evidence of a fair

17 argument that the Project may cause significant environmental impacts including, but not limited
18 to, urban decay impacts. Such impacts were not studied at all by the County in approving the
19 Project.
20 53. For example, Petitioner submitted the expert opinion of Dr. Phillip King,
21 economics professor at San Francisco State University, which indicated that the Project would
22 cause other stores to close, leading to urban decay caused by vacant buildings and a potential for
23 a food dessert in other parts of the County.
24
54.
25 The County committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

26 the manner required by law in adopting a MND rather than an EIR to address this potentially

27 significant impact.

28

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION P (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Project is Inconsistent with the General Plan and Zoning
2 Laws)

3 55. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

4 in Paragraphs 1 through 54, above.

5 56. State Planning and Zoning Law a prohibits a county from approving a project that

6 is inconsistent with that county's general plan or zoning laws.
7 57. TCSB presented substantial evidence that the Project will be inconsistent with the
8 County's planning and zoning laws that require development projects to be diverse and promote
9 the historical character of the unincorporated area known as Weaverville.
10 58. Notwithstanding the Project's conflicts with the County's land use laws, County
11 prejudicially abused its discretion and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by approving
12 the Project.
13
59. The County's action in approving the Project despite these inconsistencies with 14
the County's planning and zoning laws is improper. In order for the County to approve the 15

16 Project, the Project must be modified or the general plan must be amended.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 17

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:

19 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:
approve the 20 a. Commanding the County to immediately set aside its decision to

21 Project, as memorialized in Resolution No. 2020-05;

22 b. Commanding the County to immediately suspend all activities in furtherancel

23 of the Project, including but not limited to issuing building and grading permits;

24 C. Commanding the County to comply with CEQA and State Planning and
25 Zoning Law in any subsequent action(s) taken to approve the Project including, but not limited
26 to, ensuring the review period for any environmental document not expire on a day the County
27 Planning offices are not open to the public and/or prepare an EIR;
28

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 2. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and/or preliminary and permanent
2 injunction restraining the County and/or Best Development Group, LLC (including any
3 successors or agents), or any other Real Parties in Interest, from taking any action to carry out
4 the Project pending the outcome of this litigation;
5 3. That Petitioner be awarded the costs incurred in bringing this action, and
6 reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5, the "common benefit"
7 theory, Government Code section 800, or as otherwise provided by law or equity. 8
4.
9 That the Court grants such other and further relief as may be just and proper.
