24 Petitioner, JOAN JOAQUIN WOOD ("Wood" or "Petitioner") respectfully petitions this
25 Court for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, for
26 declaration of rights and injunctive relief directed at SUTTER COUNTY, BY AND THROUGH
27 ITS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (Respondent") to set aside Respondent's approval of U-19-
28 026 [now Parcel Map 1236] and U-19-031 which approvals are dependent upon one another and

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 1

1 inextricably linked (the approvals permitted under U-19-026 and U-19-031 are collectively

2 referred to as the "Approvals" or "Project"), Respondent's actions violate State and local land

3 use and environmental laws, and amount to a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate

4 and preliminary and permanent injunctions are necessary to remedy Respondent's failure to

5 adequately address the Project's environmental impacts and violations of state and local land use

6 laws, to ensure that Respondent complies with all applicable Federal State and local laws, and to

7 ensure proper review and disclosure, and mitigation of the potential environmental impacts

8 resulting from the approval and implementation of the Project pursuant to the California

9 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). By this Verified Petition, Petitioner represents the

10 following:

11 PARTIES

12 1. Petitioner is the owner of farming property described as Assessor's Parcel Map
13 Nos. 13-260-002 and -004 of approximately 250 acres primarily farmed in rice and subject to

14 Williamson Act contracts. Petitioner and her family have owned this farm property since 1920.

15 Petitioner's farm is located immediately to the East of the Project owned by Real Party in

16 Interest GORDON A. RAUB '03 TRUST, ET AL., in the unincorporated area of Sutter,

17 California.

18 2. Respondent SUTTER COUNTY, BY AND THROUGH ITS BOARD OF

19 SUPERVISORS (hereinafter "Respondent") is the agency with direct authority over land use
20 approvals related to the unincorporated property owned by Real Parties in Interest. Respondent

21 is the lead agency responsible under CEQA, and state and local land use laws and regulations.
22 Respondent has a duty under state law to comply with all state and federal law requirements,

23 including CEQA and the Federal Endangered Species Act ("ESA") when considering private and

24 public requests for development approval.

25 3. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest JEFF HELM, DBA
26 HELM PROPERTIES (hereinafter "Helm") acts as the developer and Applicant for development

27 of the property subject to the approvals complained of herein.

28 ///

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 2

1 4. Petitioner is further informed and believes that Real Party in Interest GORDON

2 A. RAUB '03 TRUST, ET AL. (hereinafter "Raub Trust") holds title to the property subject to

3 the approvals complained of herein,

4 5. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,

5 corporate, or otherwise, of the Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does through 100.

6 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said Real Parties in Interest are in

7 some manner responsible for the adoption of, imposition of, or administration of those laws,

8 ordinances, and regulations of which Petitioner complains herein. Petitioner will amend this

9 Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of the fictitiously named Real Parties in

10 Interest when such information has been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and

11 thereon alleges that each fictitiously named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner

12 for the occurrences herein alleged.

13 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

14 6. Petitioner is informed and believes that on or about December 18, 2019, Helm

15 obtained prior approval for a parcel map involving 137.78 acres owned by Raub Trust, hereafter

16 referred to as Parcel Map U-19-026. Parcel Map U-19-026 divided the 137.78 acres into five (5)

17 parcels but withheld a 22.89-acre parcel designated Estate Residential as a remainder. Parcel

18 Map U-19-026 was actually processed as four (4) parcels and one remainder, facially complying

19 with the Subdivision Map Act. Respondent County prepared a negative declaration, which
20  excluded consideration of the remainder parcel, and determined that the four parcels would

21 constitute less than significant impacts or no impacts until the parcels with Estate Residential

22 zoning were processed with future small lot maps. Parcel Map U-19-026 (PM No. 1236) was

23 recorded June 16, 2020, showing Parcels A (20.43 net acres), B (15.73 net acres), C (20.42) net

24 acres), and a Remainder (22.89 gross acres). The southernmost parcel of that map (Parcel D),

25 which is the adjacent agriculturally zoned parcel, is not included in the Project that is the subject

26 of this Petition/Complaint.

27 7. Before said parcel map was recorded, in approximately February 2020, Real Party
28 Helm applied for a subdivision map described as U-19-031 on 78.39 acres, seeking approval of

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 3

1 84 lots. These lots were designed and located on Lots A, B, and C of Parcel Map PM No. 1236,
2 and the remainder parcel of the parcel map.
3 8. The first public hearing for U-19-031 was June 17, 2020, the day after PM 1236
4 was recorded. That proposal was for 84 single family homes located on 71.58 acres, with
5 internal roadways and independent septic systems for each homesite. Petitioner is informed and
6 believes that over 270 emails and adverse comments were received. Because of the level of
7 opposition, and the fact that two of the Commissioners did not receive the staff reports and
8 opposition packets before the hearing, Sutter County continued the hearing to July 15, 2020,
9 when additional comments, all adverse, were received. Nevertheless, the Planning Commission
10 approved the project, and planning staff filed a Notice of Determination adopting Mitigated
11 Negative Declaration on July 16, 2020.
12 9, Because U-19-026 improperly evaded recognition of Respondent Helm's total
13 plans for development of the Project, and sequentially developed the same property under U-19-
14 031, Petitioner also alleges the right to challenge the approvals contained in U-19-026, and all
15 deferrals of environmental approvals contained therein. For the purposes of this Writ, the
16 property and approvals owned by Real Party Raub Trust and developed or planned to be
17 developed by Real Party Helm will be described as "the Project".
18 10. Petitioner timely appealed the Project to the Board of Supervisors on or about
19 July 22, 2020, and Respondent County set the appeal hearing for August 24, 2020. On August
20 15, 2020, Petitioner, through her attorney, filed a Public Records Act Request seeking all
21 documents related to the U-19-031 and U-19-026 Projects. As of the time of this filing, no
22 documents responsive to this PRA Request have been received. Live attendance at the hearings
23 was restricted because of Respondent's adoption of COVID-19 related restrictions. During the
24 Appeal hearing, at least 20 persons spoke, and at least 20 opposition emails were received. After
25 the Board treated all written comments as unimportant, even stating that they "had no time to

26 read any emails", the Board of Supervisors denied the Appeal on August 24, 2020.
27 /1/

28  ///

WOOD- PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 4
(

1 11. Respondent County filed a Notice of Determination on July 16, 2020. The Notice

2 of Determination is invalid and defective because, under 14 Code. Admin Regs. (hereinafter

3 "Guidelines") §15094, said notice did not contain the date of approval.

4 JURISDICTION, RIPENESS, VENUE, STANDING, AND EXHAUSTION

5 12. Due to Petitioner's proximity to the U-19-026 and U-19-031 property, Petitioner

6 will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse land use and environmental impacts that

7 may result from the Project. Petitioner, as the owner of the property and as a taxpayer and voter

8 in Sutter County, has a direct interest in ensuring that Project approvals such as the Project

9 herein complained are conducted according to law.

10 13. Petitioner has standing to bring this action as a property owner, voter and taxpayer

11 of Sutter County to compel a public duty in the form of Respondent complying with state and

12 federal environmental laws and state land use laws.

13 14. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("PRC")

14 section 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to Respondent on August 27, 2020. The

15 Proof of Service by Mail of the Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition has been filed

16 concurrently with this Petition.

17 15. Petitioner will comply with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 and Code of

18 Civil Procedure Section 388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the
19 commencement of this action.

20 16. Petitioner has a right to enforce Respondent's mandatory duties under State and

21 local law related to the land use approvals of U-19-026 and U-10-031. Petitioner does not have a

22 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

23 17. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and

24 Petitioner by Respondent fully satisfying the requirements of state, federal and local law,

25 including complying with CEQA, prior to granting the Approval. A clear and significant benefit

26 will be independently conferred upon the general public by Respondent fully satisfying the

27 requirements of CEQA and application Sutter County ordinances and policies. In instituting this

28 action, Petition seeks to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty. These challenged project

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 5

1 approvals were vigorously opposed by the public, including Petitioner, and the public is vitally

2 and beneficially interested in assuring that the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled.

3 Granting the relief requested by Petitioner would confer significant benefit on large class of

4 persons, in that the fundamental rules of law would be effected.

5 18. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

6 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ

7 of Mandate and other appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to set aside Respondent's

8 approval of the Project.

9 19. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

10 arose in Sutter County where the governing agency that issued the Approvals, and the real

11 property in question, is located.

12 20. Petitioner and substantial members of the public living in the rural area of Sutter
13 surrounding the Project properties, presented all the objections to the Approvals raised in this

14 action, including Respondent's failure to comply with Sutter County's policies and
15 implementation measures incorporated in its general plan, and CEQA and ESA, prior to
16 Respondent granting the approvals. Petitioner timely appealed the initial approval of U-19-031,

17 thereby exhausting Petitioner's administrative remedies, to the extent such exhaustion is required

18 by Public Resources Code §21177(a) or other law prior to commencing this action.

19 21. Petitioner and these other objectors presented oral and written testimony in
20 proceedings before Sutter County Planning Commission, Sutter County planning and
21 development staff, and the Sutter County Board of Supervisors, and objected to these approvals
22 thereby exhausting Petitioner's administrative remedies, to the extent such exhaustion is required

23 by Pub. Res. Code §21177(b) or other law prior to commencing this action.

24 22. Petitioner has brought this Action timely. The filing date of Notice of
25 Determination iso materially invalid because the Helm Project was not final under Sutter County

26 Codes or relevant state law at the time it was filed. Pub. Res. Code §21167 mandates that the

27 Notice of Determination should be filed when the approvals are final; which in this case could

28 not occur until after the Board of Supervisors voted on Petitioner's Appeal, August 24, 2020.

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 6

1 Sutter County Zoning Code §1500-23-080 [F] provides that "A timely appeal of an action shall

2 stay the effective date of the action, for that portion of the permit being appealed, until the appeal|

3 has been acted upon or withdrawn." Section [G] also states that each appeal shall be considered

4 to be de novo hearing on the matter being appealed. Finality is determined by the action of the

5 Board of Supervisors at the public hearing (Section [H]). Such Sutter County Zoning Code

6 language comports with ordinary justice, because otherwise this Writ would have to have been

7 filed on or before August 15, nine days before the Board of Supervisors' hearing on Petitioner's

8 Appeal was heard. Because the Notice of Determination was filed prior to final approval of the

9 Project, and no Amended Notice of Determination has been filed correcting the final date, this

10 Writ can be filed within 180 days of final approval pursuant to PRC §21152(a); Guidelines

11 §15062(d).

12 23. Judicial Council Emergency Rule CO-20-09 tolled the statute of limitations of all

13 legal claims accruing between April 6, 2020 and August 3, 2020, until August 3, 2020 for all

14 causes of action with limitations periods of 180 days or less. Therefore, although Petitioner

15 believes that she is entitled under Guideline §15094 to file 180 days from August 24, 2020, the

16 date of final approval, she has filed this Writ on September 2, 2020 in an abundance of caution.

17 Petitioner will amend this Writ or seek leave to amend this Writ pending her review of County

18 documents when received.

19 I.

20 VIOLATIONS OF SUTTER COUNTY GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING CODE

21 24. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-states and re-pleads all allegations set forth above as though

22 fully set forth herein.

23 25. Petitioner asserts that due to Respondent's improper segregation of the whole of

24 the development plans for the entire 137.78-acre development, the public should be entitled to

25 challenge both approvals as one coordinated approval as of 180 days of those approvals.

26 Respondent's segregation of the projects constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion under Pub.

27 Resources Code §21005(a), because it has deprived the public and decision makers of substantiall

28

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 7

relevant information about the Project's likely adverse impacts, when taken as a whole. Kings

2 County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 712.

3 26. This improper segmenting determination results in failing to consider the likely

4 development of at least 140 homes and avoids all general plan policies applicable to larger

5 developments. Since these policies and mitigation measures were adopted by Respondent to

6 reduce anticipate significant impacts in the General Plan, and these policies must be strictly

7 applied to review of new projects, in order to approve such projects without preparation of an

8 environmental impact report. Thus, in addition to the separate proscriptions against improper

9 segmenting contained in the PRC and the Subdivision Map Act, such segmenting works to
10 invalidate approvals a as a negative declaration as a matter of law.

11 27. The Sutter Rural Planned Community [new growth area] is explicitly identified in

12 the General Plan as an agricultural area, with extremely limited infrastructure, and special

13 policies and mitigation were incorporated in the General Plan to assure that development in that

14 area did not adversely affect the character of the area or the predominantly agricultural

15 operations surrounding then existing residences. When the 2015 and 2030 General Plans were

16 adopted, Respondent recognized that new development in the area should be limited until

17 essential infrastructure could be developed to accommodate substantial population increases, and

18 adopted policies to limit development and plan for needed infrastructure especially related to
19 sewer and water systems and roads. As of the date of this file, no essential infrastructure has
20 been planned designed or build to support development of residential communities as described

21 in the General Plan.

22 28, Respondent County has failed to meet these obligations of the Sutter County
23 Zoning Code and 2030 General Plan as follows:

24 A. Farmland Conversion and Agricultural Buffers:

25 The property previously approved to be removed from active agriculture and the adjacent

26 parcels owned by Petitioner and the Lemenagers are Prime Agricultural Land and were so

27 designated in the County's General Plan 2030 Update. The General Plan EIR concluded that the

28 loss of farmland was significant and unavoidable; and claimed that no mitigation was available.

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 8

1 The General Plan adopted specific mitigation to be applied to the conversion of any Agricultural

2 Land to legally authorize such a conversion, which mitigation has not been fully applied to the

3 Project.

4 B. Approval of the Project Violates General Plan Agricultural Land Preservation

5 Policies as Follows:

6 i. General Plan Policy AG 1.5 states: Agricultural Land Conversion.

7 Discourage the conversion of agricultural land to other uses unless all of the following

8 findings can be made: a. The net community benefit derived from conversion of the

9 land outweighs the need to protect the land for long-term agricultural use; b. There are

10 no feasible alternative locations for the proposed use that would appreciably reduce

11 impacts upon agricultural lands; and c. The use will not have significant adverse effects,

12 or can mitigate such effects, upon existing and future adjacent agricultural lands and
operations.
13 No such findings were made, and no evidence was submitted to support findings
14 for (c), because the necessary buffers are inadequate.
15 ii. General Plan Policy AG 2.1 and AG Goal 2 mandate that new
16 developments must be designed to minimize conflicts. As shown in the following
17 subsections, conflicts have not been adequately minimized.
18 iii. Sutter County Zoning Code $1500-19-040 mandates a minimum 300-foot
19 buffer between the Project property and Petitioner's property, and that of the
20 Lemenagers. Contrary to this provision, Sutter County permitted the beginning of the
21 buffer to begin well inside Petitioner's Property which is actively farmed, resulting in
22 buffers substantially smaller than mandated by Sutter County's Zoning Çode. In at least
23 some of the maps prepared by Real Party Helm, the buffer actually extended 40 feet into
24 Petitioner's agricultural property, a violation of General Plan Policy AG 2.3 b [buffers
25 shall not be located on the agricultural parcel(s)]. By counting the existing water flow
26
areas on the northerly portion of the Project adjacent to Lemenager's, and the stream area
27 on Petitioner's property, the actual buffers are only 260 feet and 230 feet, respectively.
28

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 9

1 iv. Lots 2. 3, 8, 9, 13 and 14 all extend into the buffer zone. Buyers of these

2 properties will undoubtedly put structures, possibly outdoor patios, outdoor kitchens,

3 swimming pools and similar improvements, within the buffer zone, all actions that will

4 increase, not reduce, conflicts arising from the adjacent farming activities. As stated in

5 ii., above, this violates General Plan Policy AG 2.1 and AG Goal 2. The requirement

6 that new home buyers sign a Right to Farm Disclosure will not prevent these owners
from harassing those farming on Petitioner's adjacent property.

8 V. General Plan Policies AG 2.3 a. and e. provide that the biological design

9 of the buffer should ensure that the buffer does not provide a host environment for pests

10 or carriers and should address vector issues. Despite objections, no revisions to the

11 detention ponds have been incorporated to reduce mosquitos and other vermin.

12 vi. General Plan Policies AG 2.3 c. and d. reguire the use of additional buffer

13 options, in addition to the physical separation or setback, depending on the nature of the

14 crops and overall topography. The features to be incorporated in addition to the setback

15 should be greenbelts, roads, etc. However, staff has reduced the buffer to include the

16 irrigation canals, not to treat the canal as an additional separation, as required by the

17 General Plan.

18 vii. There is nothing in the General plan that presumes a reduction of the

19 buffer between agricultural operations and an intensive residential development; in fact,

20 the policies of the General Plan are the opposite.

21 viii. It does not appear that feasible alternative locations in or around the

22 community of Sutter for the proposed use were included in the environmental analysis, in

23 violation of General Plan Policy AG 1.5.c.

24 C. Failure to Mandate Funding in Support of Law Enforcement and Fire.

25 Respondent failed to evaluate and require Real Parties to provide adequate

26 funding for sheriff's and fire services as set forth below.

27 i. General Plan Policy 1.3 provides that New Development provide funding

28 resources necessary to fund sufficient law enforcement services and facilities with no

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 10

1 adverse fiscal effects to the County or decline in current law enforcement service levels,
2 and that enforcement will be provided through a "rigorous review to determine impacts to
3 law enforcement in accordance with CEQA."

4 ii. General Plan Policy 2.6 requires new development to provide the revenue
and fiscal resources necessary to fund sufficient fire protection services and facilities with
6 no adverse fiscal effects or decline in current fire protection service levels.
7 iii. Policy 1.3 is to be implemented to ensure that adequate law enforcement
8 staffing is available for new growth, and Implementation Program PS 1-A provides that
9 compliance with this provision would result in a less than significant impact. No such
10 requirements were imposed on Real Parties as part of the conditions of approval, relying
11 instead on minimal general fund contributions to meet Helm's obligations.
12 The testimony obtained from representatives of the Sherriff's Department and
13 Fire, confirmed that the general fund contributions were insufficient to ensure that
14 provision of services to the 84 anticipated residences could be assured. Therefore,
15 Respondent's determination of compliance with the general plan policies is not supported
16 by the testimony.

17 D. Hydrology and Water Quality:
18 Respondent County has deferred all drainage, hydrology and water quality studies until
19| immediately before recording or construction. Such deferral is improper in that Petitioner has
20 been unable to determine from the publicly available information that proposed installation of 84
21 Onsite Sewage Treatment Systems ['OWTS"] can comply with either the policies or
22 implementation guidelines of the 2030 General Plan as follows:

23 i. The unincorporated area of Sutter shows that ground water levels are very
24 shallow, and that the Sutter subbasin tends to be within 10 feet of the ground surface.
25 ii. The 2030 General Plan acknowledges that such systems lead to
26 contamination of groundwater where not properly sited. The proposed 84 OWTS
27 systems [not considering the "remainder" areas] are located next to the municipal water
28 well. Per the General Plan Figure 6.10-4, the property in PM 1236 and U-19-031 already

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 11

1 contains greater than 45 mg/L nitrates, which is the maximum standard for contaminants

2 such as nitrates. The property area also contains between 10-50 ug/L of arsenic which

3 substantially exceeds EPA's maximum contaminant levels of 10 ug/L.

4 iii. General Plan Policy ER 6.11 requires that new development protect

5 natural drainage systems through site design, and low impact development, among other

6 mitigations. Gen Plan Policy 13.J conditions new development to adequately study and

7 plan local drainage for the development. However, the Project's design plans for

8 residences in the south east corner of the properties, where canal seepage and flooding

9 are likely based on the history in the record and defers the necessary drainage and

10 hydrology analysis.

11 iv. General Plan Policy I. 2.8 requires that new development should utilize a

12 public sewer system where feasible and if not feasible, only to permit on site systems

13 when the intensity of new development is appropriately limited.
14 V. The General Plan Implementation Program 12.H requires that the design

15 of such OWTS meet all federal and state codes, 12-I requires that County approval of

16 such systems only be permitted where such disposal will not constitute a hazard to health

17 or water supplies, and 12-L, restricts use of septic systems in areas prone to flooding or

18 that have a high water table or seepage problems. To the contrary, Respondent approved

19 the Project knowing that the southeast quadrant of the Project is prone to flooding and

20 seepage.

21 Failure to enforce these policies amounts to a prejudicial abuse of discretion

22 because such mitigation and policies were adopted by the General Plan.

23 E. Respondent failed to require evaluation of the Project under Traffic/Air Quality

24 policies as mandated by Mitigation Policies of the 2030 General Plan.

25 Respondent County relies on a per-project designation of LOS D at peak times or LOS C

26 or better at other times. New development is required under the General Plan M-2.5 to analyze

27 the project and fully mitigate for its impacts.
28 ///

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 12

1 i. Under Policy M 2.6 Respondent failed to evaluate traffic to include the

2 entire project's impacts.

3 ii. Section 6.14-7 requires an analysis by Vehicle miles traveled, whether or

4 not the traditional calculations of LOS are used. No such analysis was prepared by Real

5 Party in Interest Helm, or Respondent. By permitting segmentation of the total projects

6 and failing to analyze at least 57 acres of the project development's impact, Respondent

7 failed to treat the Project in its full scale, and failed to apply M-3.2 and 3.4 to ensure that
vehicle miles traveled ("VMT) from the rural area of Sutter to likely employment

9 centers would be reduced by requiring facilitation of transit plans.

10 ili. Respondent's failure to evaluate and mitigate the impacts of round trips to

11 most likely employment sources violates Climate change Reduction Measures R2-T2 to

12 reduce new development toward already dense population centers.

13 iv. The U-19-031 MND did not analyze air quality impacts because the

14 FRAQMD analysis threshold of 130 homes was not met. However, the Project was

15 segmented, and the two parcel maps taken together as a whole should trigger an analysis.

16 The General Plan states that certain Air Quality Impacts could not be quantified because

17 specific project plans were unknown at the time the General Plan analysis was

18 undertaken and stated further that site-specific mitigation would be undertaken on

19 individual projects. Allowing these Parcel Maps to segment to avoid the analysis

20 threshold would result in the avoidance of an air quality analysis altogether. See General

21 Plan Impacts 6.4-3 and 6.4-4.

22 F. Design Control Obligations.

23 Respondent County is obligated under its Subdivision Ordinance §1400-100 to regulate
24 and control the design and improvements of land within the County of Sutter in order to preserve

25 and enhance the health, safety, welfare and amenities of the community. Respondent County

26 must mitigate the impacts to its farm and agricultural resources, and also protect the community

27 by properly analyzing air quality, drainage, and hydrological and traffic issues as addressed
28 further below in Section IV.

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 13

1 G. County Failure to Provide Notice. Petitioner received no notice of either the

2 hearing on U-19-026 or the first hearing for on June 17, 2020 U-19-031 as required by

3 Government Code $65091.

4 II.

5 VIOLATIONS OF PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE [CEOAl

6 29. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-states and re-pleads all allegations set forth above as though

7 fully set forth herein.

8 30. Respondent County failed to meet the obligations of the California Environmental

9 Quality Act. CEQA provides that all non-exempt projects are subject to environmental review.

10 As the Lead Agency under CEQA, Respondent has a duty to comply with the requirements of
11 CEQA and its determination that the Project, which explicitly identifies 137.83 acres of present

12 and future development, but considers only the reduced scope of U-19-031, improperly segments|

13 review in violation of state law when Respondent adopted negative declarations and a mitigated a

14 negative declaration.

15 31. Section 15378(a)(3) and (c) of the CEQA Guidelines provides, **Project' means the

16 whole of an action, which as the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the
17 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is

18 any of the following, . . (3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit,

19 license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies, and (c)The term
20 "project" refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several

21 discretionary approvals by governmental agencies." The term "project" does not mean each
22 separate governmental approval. Because the Notice of Determination and approvals of the

23 parcel map and subdivision map amounts to discretionary awards by Respondent, the Approvals

24 are a "project" within the scope of CEQA.

25 32. Following preliminary review of a project proposal, a lead agency must prepare

26 an initial study which considers all of the impacts of the proposals. Respondent consented to

27 Real Party Helm's request to process the parcels separately although both proposals were being

28 reviewed sequentially, and very close in time, and incorporated the same property. Respondent

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 14

1 also improperly consented to Real Party's proposal to withhold review of the "remainders"

2 although as set forth above, the ER zoned parcel and the Agricultural zoned parcel were not

3 entitled to be treated as "remainders". By consenting to Real Party's proposal Respondent

4 ignored the totality of impacts resulting from the project as a whole as summarized below.

5 33. The approval of Map No. 1236 and U-19-031 have the potential to cause specific

6 environmental effects such as traffic impacts, air quality impacts, water quality impacts, climate

7 change, conversion of agricultural land, species impacts and other potentially significant

8 environmental effects that have not been studied or mitigated as required by CEQA.

9 34. Respondent failed to apply the General Plan Policies summarized in Section I above. l

10 Without incorporation of such policies, Map No. 1236 and U-19-031 were approved without the

11 required mitigations necessary to support these negative declaration determinations.

12 35. Petitioner and members of the public produced evidence raising: fair argument

13 that the projects were not adequately investigated, and that an Environmental Impact Report for

14 the project as a whole should have been prepared and evaluated.

15 36. Respondent's limited review under the negative declaration and mitigated

16 negative declaration is inadequate and incomplete because it never considered the impacts

17 summarized below. Consequently, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by

18 CEQA and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by segmenting the project, and by

19 approving the Project without studying potential environmental impacts pursuant to the
20 requirements of CEQA.

21 37. Respondent ignored the evidence presented by Petitioner and her neighbors

22 addressing the following impacts:

23 A. Air Quality/Smart Growth Principles/VMT. Sutter County's failure to evaluate
24 the Project's distance from Yuba City, Sacramento and Roseville/Rocklin has violated the Smart

25 Growth principles required under Guidelines 15064.3 and the General Plan. Development of

26 intensive residential property at least 7-10 miles from the likely sources of employment (Yuba

27 City area, Sacramento, Rocklin/Roseville area) impermissibly ignores the requirements of the

28 General Plan to determine and mitigate for vehicle miles traveled and its impact on air quality.

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 15

1 Sutter County also failed to evaluate air quality impacts as a result of the anticipated increase in

2 traffic resulting from the proposed Project. Respondent's General Plan policies were adopted to

3 avoid compliance with strict air quality conditions imposed by state law related to climate

4 change, by assuring that traffic resulting from projects remained below specific thresholds. The

5 Projects were not reviewed anticipating total traffic impacts of the 137+ acre development

6 resulting increases to VMT. However, since the Rural Planned Community of Sutter contains

7 round trips to Yuba City, the closest employment center of 20 miles, Sacramento of 30 VMTs

8 and Roseville/Rocklin of 25 VMTs, the development of the Project without evaluation and

9 mitigation for these impacts, violates the General Plan Policies at M-2.6; and M-3.2 and M-3.4,

10 and Guideline 15064.3 Respondent's failure to require such studies when General Plan deferred

11 evaluation of VMT to individual projects amounts to a further prejudicial abuse of discretion, as

12 Real Parties' segmentation allowed them to fly under the necessary trigger for analysis.
13 B. Farm and Agricultural Land Conversion. Sutter County failed to properly

14 evaluate the impacts of the proposed Project's removal of Class I Agricultural Land in violation

15 of General Plan Policies AG 1.5, 2.1 and 2.3 and impose all mandatory mitigation conditions on

16 the Project required in said Policies as stated above in paragraph 28.B.

17 C. Improper Deferral of Drainage Studies. Sutter County failed to evaluate the
18 acknowledged impacts of inadequate evaluation of hydrology and drainage, permitting the

19 deferral of evaluation until immediately prior to building permit. The actual needed mitigation
20 which Sutter County anticipates was not evaluated by Respondent County or incorporated into

21 the Mitigated Negative Declaration. Respondent County's proposed mitigation and conditions of

22 approval -- which permit evaluation of the southeast portion of the Project and possible removal

23 and redesign of lots after final approval by the County based on studies to be completed prior to

24 issuance of building or grading -- violates Pub. Resources Code §21080(c)(2); 14 Cal. Admin.

25 Code §15070(b)(1). Hydrology issues are particularly important to be thoroughly evaluated in

26 the context of the location of this Project. The easterly boundary of the proposed subdivision

27 already incorporates proposed detention ponds to address overflow and flooding issues; which

28 ponds are located immediately adjacent to the areas proposed as individual leach fields for

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 16

1 proposed Lots 1-8 Unit 2, and 2-14 Unit 4. In addition to County-admitted issues related to

2 flooding, and proximity to FEMA designated flood zones, which may make such lots

3 undevelopable, Petitioner can find no evidence in the record where the potential impacts of

4 nitrates resulting from the 84 proposed leach fields to the municipal wells were reviewed and

5 considered as mandated by the 2030 General Plan and state law. . 14 Cal. Code. Regs.
6 §15126.4(a)(1)(B) [CEQA Guidelines].

7 D. Improper Deferral of Water Analysis. Sutter County impermissibly deferred

8 evaluation of water capacity for the Project to determinations to be made by Sutter County Local

9 Agency Formation Commission [LAFCO] as part of the future proposed annexation. Deferral is

10 not allowed under CEQA.

11 E. Special Status Species. Sutter County has failed to evaluate and mandate

12 mitigation for special species, especially including the Giant Garter Snake.

13 F. Improper Segmentation of Project. Approval of the Project is a violation of the

14 rules against segmentation or piecemealing of a project, which is explicitly forbidden under

15 CEQA. CEQA Guideline 15378 defines "Project" as "the whole of an action," a broad

16 interpretation intended to provide maximum protection to the environment by providing

17 sufficient detail regarding all aspects of the Project such that the decision makers can make an

18 informed decision. As stated above in Paragraphs 6-8.25 and 26, Real Party Helm processed

19 prior Parcel Map U-19-026 in late 2019, and before the map had even been recorded, applied for

20 this subdivision Project (U-19-031) in January 2020, which was approved much less than one

21 year later in July 2020, only one month after the prior map was actually recorded in June.

22 Respondent County explicitly evaded evaluation of the ER and Agricultural zoned property,

23 because Real Party Helm did not submit those sections for consideration in U-19-031.

24 G. Failure to properly evaluate traffic impacts. Despite repeated public objections by

25 Petitioner and others, Respondent failed to require Real Party to evaluate traffic from the whole

26 of the project based on actual traffic conditions. None of the baseline evaluations were

27 conducted during harvest operations; and none of the traffic calculations took into consideration

28

1 modifications in Hiway 20-Humphrey's recent designation of new major truck route as a result
2 of recent Caltrans roadway improvements.

3 H. Invalid Notice of Determination. The NOD is defective because it did not contain
4 the date of approval as required under 14 Code. Admin Regs. §15094(b)(3).
5 III.

6 VIOLATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CODE
7 (Subdivision Map Act)
8 38. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-states and re-pleads all allegations set forth above as though
9 fully set forth herein.

10 39. As set forth in Section I, above, Respondent County and Real Parties violated the
11 Subdivision Map Act ("SMA") by allowing more than one Remainder Parcel when it processed
12 U-19-026, now PM 1236, Petitioner alleges that the Staff Report and approvals assert that
13 Respondent Helm sought and received approval for the West Raub Parcel Map identifying a
14 formal remainder parcel as 22.46 acres, and a "separate agricultural Parcel D of 59.17 acres",
15 The stated basis for the ER designated and Agriculturally zoned Remainders was financing.
16 Such determination was determined to violate Government Code §66426. See 77 Ops. Cal. Atty.
17 Gen. 185 (Cal. A.G.), 1994. Under Government Code §66426, Sutter County can only approve
18 such a map after extensive review of the proposed subdivision and consideration of such matters
19 as the property's suitability for development, the adequacy of roads, sewer, drainage, and other
20 services, the preservation of agricultural lands and sensitive natural resources, and dedication
21 issues. (See, §§ 66451-66451.7, 66452-66452.13, 66453-66472.1, 66473-66474.10, 66475-
22 66478.)

23 40. Respondent County failed to meet the obligations of the California Government
24 Code as follows:

25 A. As set forth in Section I, Section II, Paras. 25-26 above, Petitioner is informed and
26 believes that the approved Project, taken together with the prior approval of the land pursuant to
27 Application U-19-026, constitutes improper segmentation and piecemealing of the entire project,
28 in violation of the Subdivision Map Act, California Government Code §§66426, and that this

WOOD -- PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 18

1 Court's review of U-19-026 and the facial invalidity of approving such Parcel Map in serial with

2 U-19-031 should be considered jointly and all impacts of the intended future development of the

3 Remainder parcels should be required as part of evaluation of U-19-031, especially involving the

4 environmental review of U-19-026 which was processed as a negative declaration because future

5 development plans were reserved by the Real Parties.

6 IV.

7 VIOLATIONS OF GOVERNMENT CODE

8 (Noticing and Consistency Requirements)

9 41. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-states and re-pleads all allegations set forth above as though
10 fully set forth herein.

11 42. Respondent County failed to meet the obligations of the California Government

12 Code as follows:

13 A. Notice of Hearing. As previously alleged, Petitioner owns the property

14 immediately adjacent to the Property Real Party seeks to develop. Neither Petitioner nor other

15 opponents who appeared at the hearing held regarding Real Party's application for the U-19-026

16 Parcel Map in December 2019 received notice of the hearing as mandated by Government Code

17 §65091. Petitioner also received no notice of the June 17, 2020 hearing on Real Party's

18 application for Subdivision Map U-19-031, although she had previously written the

19 Development Department summarizing concerns related to residential development encroaching

20 on her property.

21 V.

22 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

23 43. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-states and re-pleads all allegations set forth above as though

24 fully set forth herein.

25 44. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists among the parties, in that

26 Petitioner makes the contentions alleged above and is informed and believes, and on that basis

27 alleges, that Respondent Sutter County and Real Parties dispute these contentions.

28

WOOD - PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT - 19

1 45. Petitioner desires a judicial determination and declaration as to the effectiveness
2 and validity of Respondent County's actions by approving Parcel Map No. 1236 without
3 evaluation as a material part of U-19-031; failing to review the development consistent with its
4 obligations under the General Plan and CEQA; improperly approved U-19-031 without adequate
5 completion of the evaluations for drainage, hydrology/water quality, traffic, air quality, loss of
6 agricultural land, species, and others as set forth herein; without imposing mitigation protecting
7 agricultural properties and the public as mandated by General Plan Policies 1.5, 2.1 and 2.3; and
8 failing to provide Petitioner with adequate notice and opportunity to be heard on these matters.
9 PRAYER
10 WHEREFORE, Petitioner/Plaintiff demands judgment against Respondent Sutter County
11 and Real Parties in Interest as follows:

12 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate ordering Respondent Sutter
13 County and/or Real Parties in Interest to:

14 a. Commanding Respondent to immediately set aside its approval of U-19-
15 026 (Parcel Map 1236) and U-19-031;
16 b. Commanding Respondent to immediately suspect all activities in
17 furtherance of these approvals.
18 C. Commanding Respondent to re-open the approval process and to conduct
19 environmental review of these Approvals as one project and otherwise comply with all
20 state and local statues including CEQA in any subsequent action taken with regard to the
21 Approvals;

22 d. Commanding Respondent to comply with all Mandatory Mitigation
23 Measures adopted as part of the 2030 General Plan EIR;
24 e. Commanding Respondent to conduct all incomplete analyses, especially
25 involving traffic, water capacity, drainage and hydrology, water and air quality, conversion of
26 agricultural land and species hereunder local and state law to ensure that the proposed Project
27 can be adequately mitigated;
