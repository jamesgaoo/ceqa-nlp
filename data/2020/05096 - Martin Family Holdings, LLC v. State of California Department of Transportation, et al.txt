22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This Petition challenges actions by Respondents California Department of
24 Transportation ("Caltrans"), Mr. Toks Omishakin, Director of Caltrans ("Omishakin"), and Mr.
25 Dan McElhinney, Director of Caltrans District 10 (*McElhinney') (collectively "Respondents")
26 in approving the North County Corridor New State Route 108 Project ("Project"), certifying an
27 Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") for the Project, and adopting findings required under the
28 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 2. Petitioner a seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the

2 Project is invalid and void, and that the EIR prepared for the Project fails to satisfy the
3 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
4 section 15000 et seq.

5 PARTIES

6 3. Petitioner Martin Family Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company
7 ("Petitioner"), owns agricultural real property in the County of Stanislaus consisting of
8 approximately 36 acres and identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers 083-002-001 and 083-002-

9 016 (the "Property"). The Property is located at the southeast corner of Oakdale Road and
10 Claribel Road, and lies completely within the Project area. The Project as approved by

11 Respondents in the EIR will sever the Property in two, causing significant agricultural, traffic and
12 economic impacts that have not been adequately addressed in the EIR through consideration of
13 alternatives or mitigation measures. Since 2011 Petitioner, through its authorized representative,
14 has actively engaged in the administrative proceedings around the Project and its environmental
15 review under CEQA. Petitioner's interests as the owner of the Property will be directly affected
16  by the impacts of the Project. As the owner of the Property, Petitioner has a direct and substantial
17 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to environmental
18 protection, and is adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving
19 the Project.

20 4. Respondent Caltrans is an agency of the State of California. Caltrans is the CEQA
21 "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Caltrans is responsible for
22 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
23 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
24 environmental impacts. Caltrans is responsible for implementing and complying with the
25 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.

26 5. Respondent Omishakin is the Director of Caltrans, responsible for all Caltrans

27 actions and decisions, including approval of the Project and certification of its EIR. Respondent
28 Omishakin is sued in his official capacity. Respondent McElhinney is the Director of Caltrans

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 2
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

District 10 and is sued in his official capacity. As District 10 Director, Respondent McElhinney is
2 responsible for the actions of the Caltrans District where the Project is located.

3 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as

4 Does 1-10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does

5 1-10, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who are responsible in some manner for the

6 conduct described in this Petition, or other individuals, entities or agencies with material interests

7 affected by the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been
8 determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such
9 identities and capacities.

10 7. Real Parties in Interest County of Stanislaus ("County"), City of Oakdale, City of
11 Riverbank, and City of Modesto (collectively, "Real Parties in Interest"), along with Caltrans
12 District 10, collectively represent the North County Corridor Transportation Expressway
13 Authority ("NCCTEA"), which comprise the CEQA "responsible agencies" for the Project. The
14 INCCTEA proposed to construct the Project in conjunction with Respondents. Real Parties in

15 Interest are local agencies that have assisted and cooperated with Respondents in developing the
16 Project and have an interest in the outcome of this litigation.

17 8. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
18 identified as Does 11-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real
19 Parties in Interest Does 11-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who may claim some
20 material interest affected by the Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project.

21 When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined,
22 Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and

23 capacities.

24 BACKGROUND FACTS

25 9. The Project will be freeway/expressway with controlled access that will connect
26 SR-219 near Modesto to SR-120 near Oakdale. It is approximately 22 miles long with a western
27 end at the SR-219 (Kiernan Avenue)/Tully Road intersection near Modesto, and an eastern and at
28 the SR-108/SR-120 intersection near Oakdale. There will be a minimum 244-foot-wide right-of-

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 3
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 way, two to three 12-foot-wide through lanes in each direction of the roadway, and 5-foot to 10-
2 foot-wide shoulders. The eastbound and westbound alignments will be separated by a 46-foot to
3 70-foot-wide median. The purpose of the Project is to, inter alia, reduce average daily traffic
4 volumes and current traffic congestion, and accommodate anticipated future traffic on SR-108
5 and the surrounding regional transportation network in the jurisdictions of Real Parties in Interest.

6 10. Caltrans conducted scoping meetings for the Project in September 2010, and
7 published a Notice of Preparation of a draft EIR on August 30, 2010. Public information meetings
g were then held on June 16, 2011 and March 6, 2014. A public hearing was held on September 7,

9 2017, and Caltrans prepared and circulated a draft EIR for public comment between August 9,
10 2019 and October 16, 2019. After the public comment period, Respondents identified a preferred
11 Project alternative, certified that the Project complies with CEQA, and prepared a Statement of
12 Overriding Considerations after identifying certain unmitigable significant impacts associated
13 with relocation, farmland and noise. The EIR was approved on March 13, 2020. The Notice of
14 Determination (NOD") was executed on May 22, 2020, and filed with the State Clearinghouse

15 on May 27, 2020.

16 11. The Property is located in what has been designated in the EIR as "Segment 1" of

17 the Project. Although the EIR identifies four Project alternatives (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B), none of
18 the Project alternatives designate different Project alignments within Segment 1 where the
19 Property is located. Eighteen other Project alternatives were considered in an Alternative Analysis
20 Report, however all were eliminated due to alleged environmental impacts. None of the
21 eliminated Project alternatives, and none of the four Project alternatives in the EIR, address the
22 specific environmental impacts caused by the alignment of the Project with respect to the
23 Property.

24 12. Since 2011 and throughout the environmental review process for the Project,
25 Petitioner, through its authorized representative David O. Romano, P.E., of Newman-Romano,
26 LLC, a California limited liability company ("Romano"), has provided comment letters with

27 respect to the proposed Project and alternatives in an effort to ensure Respondents minimize the
28 Project's environmental impacts on the Property.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 4
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. Specifically, Petitioner, through Romano, has repeatedly made clear that a Project
2 alignment approximately a quarter mile south of Claribel Avenue should be centered on the

3 southern boundary of the Property. This Project location will result in the lowest impact to

4 adjacent properties by maintaining both their economic viability as agricultural operations, as well

5 as ensuring their future developability.

6 14. Despite Petitioner's repeated comment letters and communications to Caltrans and
7 County, the EIR continues to show the Project alignment with a centerline north of the Property's

8 southern boundary. Even Caltrans and County have admitted that an alignment along the
9 Property's southern boundary line (or even farther south) is a preferable Project alternative, yet
10 the approved Project in the EIR remains north of where it should be located in order to minimize

11 impacts to agricultural resources and to protect future property access and developability.

12 15. In its comment letters, Petitioner consistently pointed out that the Project's
13 proposed alignment creates additional agricultural impacts by reducing the size of remainder
14 parcels on the north side of the alignment to less than desirable agricultural sizes. A Project
15 alignment centered on the Property's southern boundary line (or farther south) will assist in
16  maintaining agricultural viability for property located to the north of the Project, thereby reducing
17 agricultural impacts. Depending on the ultimate location of the Project, the Project as currently
18 designed could sever the Property, creating farming inefficiencies and added costs due to the extra
19 time and fuel required to move from one side of the Project to the other to perform typical
20 farming operations.

21 16. The Property is also included in the City of Modesto sphere of influence and is
22 planned for urban development. As Petitioner continually pointed out in its comment letters, the
23 EIR does not adequately consider the Project alignment through the Property in order to analyze
24 the impacts to future urban development adjacent to the Project, and whether the remaining
25 parcels have sufficient depth, shape and size to accommodate the planned development and
26 provide adequate access to serve such development.

27 17. Petitioner has also pointed out through comment letters that the right-of-way
28 required for the Project on the Property should be designed to the absolute minimum width

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 5
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F necessary to accomplish the Project goals while keeping as much land in agricultural production

2 and/or available for future development as possible. The right-of-way width of the Project as
3 approved in the EIR is much greater than necessary for the purposes of the Project.

4 18. Finally, Petitioner pointed out that by not moving the Project alignment farther

5 south, and reducing the right-of-way to the minimum size necessary, the Project will negatively

6 impact the ability for future access to the Property from Oakdale Road, which could substantially

7 impact its future developability and value. This will also create substantial severance damages by
8 devaluing the balance of the Property, Nevertheless, the EIR is completely devoid of any analysis
9 to identify how the remaining portion of the Property to the north of the Project will receive
10 access while taking into consideration the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.

11 19. For nearly a decade Petitioner has requested a Project alignment centered on the
12 Property's southern boundary line, or farther south due to the location of the existing Hetch
13 Hetchy right-of-way that traverses the Property, in order to reduce significant environmental
14 impacts to agriculture, future development and access. Respondents' final action, findings and
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations failed to adequately respond to Petitioner's comments,
16 consider feasible alternatives, and analyze significant environmental impacts.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 19,
19 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

20 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the
22 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and
23 Public Resources Code section 21168. This Court also has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in
24 this Petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
25 526 and 1060.

26 22. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project and the Property are located in
27 Stanislaus County, and the environmental impacts of Respondents' actions with respect to the
28 Project and the Property as alleged herein will be felt in Stanislaus County.

F EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

3 23. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 22,
4 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

5 24. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this Petition and
6 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

7 25. Petitioner, by and through its authorized representative Romano, has performed all
8 conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by raising each and every issue known to
9 Petitioner in writing to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21177

10 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.

11 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
12 21167.5 by mailing written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence litigation to Respondents, a
13 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

14 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
15 concurrently filing : request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
16 relating to this Petition.

17 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
19 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
20 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

21 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28,
23 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

24 30. Respondents filed the NOD on May 27, 2020. Effective April 6, 2020, the
25 California Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9, which suspended the statute of limitations
26 on all civil cases until 90 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency related to the
27 COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the statute of limitations prescribed by Public Resources Code section
28 21167 did not begin to run upon the filing of the NOD.

PRICE, POSTEL 7 & PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. The Judicial Council subsequently amended Emergency Rule 9 to suspend the
2 statutes of limitations for civil causes of action that are 180 days or less from April 6 to August 3,
3 2020. Thus the statute of limitations for filing this Petition began to run on August 3, 2020.

4 32. This Petition has been brought within 30 days of August 3, 2020, as required by
5 Public Resources Code section 21167.

6 STANDING

7 33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,
g inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

9 34. Petitioner has standing to bring this action because Petitioner owns real property in
10 Stanislaus County and located completely within the Project area. Petitioner is aggrieved by
11 | Respondents' actions and has clear, present and beneficial right to Respondents' proper
12 performance under the mandates of CEQA in the approval and implementation of the Project.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA)

15 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34,
16 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

17 36. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
18 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
19 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant Project impacts.

20 37. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to
21 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by
22 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by
23 substantial evidence. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the impacts
24 associated with the Project such as significant agricultural impacts caused by the current
25 alignment of the Project, as well as significant impacts to future development of and access to the

26 Property and neighboring properties.

27 38. Respondents' findings violate the requirements of CEQA. The CEQA findings fail

28 to establish whether significant Project impacts are reduced to insignificance or remain significant

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 8
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 even after mitigation. The findings fail to address alternative Project alignments with respect to

2 the Project on and near the Property, and fail to consider whether alternatives could have reduced

3 or avoided Project significant impacts and why certain alternatives that could have lessened the
4 Project's impacts to insignificance were not adopted or otherwise rejected. Finally, the findings
5  are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 39. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
7 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
g Project. As such, the Court should issue writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
9 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:

12 (a) vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR on the grounds that it

13 violates CEQA;

14 (b) prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate EIR for the Project;

15 (c) vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

16 (d) suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project

17 until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;

18 (e) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the

19 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be

20 necessary to bring their determination, findings or decision regarding the

21 Project into compliance with CEQA;

22 2. For an injunction and order staying the Project approval and prohibiting

23 Respondents from engaging in any physical activity pursuant to the Project until the

24 environmental review and the Project complies with the requirements of CEQA;

25 3. For Petitioner's costs associated with this action;

26 4. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
27 section 1021.5;

28 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This Petition challenges actions by Respondents California Department of
24 Transportation ("Caltrans"), Mr. Toks Omishakin, Director of Caltrans ("Omishakin"), and Mr.
25 Dan McElhinney, Director of Caltrans District 10 ("McElhinney") (collectively "Respondents")
26 in approving the North County Corridor New State Route 108 Project (*Project"), certifying an
27 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project, and adopting findings required under the
28 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 2. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the
2 Project is invalid and void, and that the EIR prepared for the Project fails to satisfy the
3 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

4 section 15000 et seq.

5 PARTIES

6 3. Petitioner Martin Family Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company
7 (*Petitioner"), owns agricultural real property in the County of Stanislaus consisting of
8 approximately 36 acres and identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers 083-002-001 and 083-002-
9 016 (the "Property"). The Property is located at the southeast corner of Oakdale Road and
10 Claribel Road, and lies completely within the Project area. The Project as approved by
11 Respondents in the EIR will sever the Property in two, causing significant agricultural, traffic and
12 economic impacts that have not been adequately addressed in the EIR through consideration of
13 alternatives or mitigation measures. Since 2011 Petitioner, through its authorized representative,
14 has actively engaged in the administrative proceedings around the Project and its environmental
15 review under CEQA. Petitioner's interests as the owner of the Property will be directly affected
16 by the impacts of the Project. As the owner of the Property, Petitioner has a direct and substantial a
17 | beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to environmental
18 protection, and is adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving
19 the Project.

20 4.

21 Respondent Caltrans is an agency of the State of California. Caltrans is the CEQA
"lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Caltrans is responsible for
22 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
23 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
24 environmental impacts. Caltrans is responsible for implementing and complying with the
25 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.

26 5. Respondent Omishakin is the Director of Caltrans, responsible for all Caltrans
27 actions and decisions, including approval of the Project and certification of its EIR. Respondent
28 Omishakin is sued in his official capacity. Respondent McElhinney is the Director of Caltrans

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARRARA, CA 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F District 10 and is sued in his official capacity. As District 10 Director, Respondent McElhinney is
2 responsible for the actions of the Caltrans District where the Project is located.

3 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as
4 Does 1-10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does

5 1-10, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who are responsible in some manner for the

6 conduct described in this Petition, or other individuals, entities or agencies with material interests
7 affected by the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been
g determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such
9 identities and capacities.

10 7. Real Parties in Interest County of Stanislaus ("County"), City of Oakdale, City of

11 Riverbank, and City of Modesto (collectively, "Real Parties in Interest"), along with Caltrans
12 District 10, collectively represent the North County Corridor Transportation Expressway
13 Authority ("NCCTEA"), which comprise the CEQA "responsible agencies" for the Project. The
14 NCCTEA proposed to construct the Project in conjunction with Respondents. Real Parties in
15 Interest are local agencies that have assisted and cooperated with Respondents in developing the
16 Project and have an interest in the outcome of this litigation.

17 8. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
18 identified as Does 11-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real
19 Parties in Interest Does 11-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who may claim some
20 material interest affected by the Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project.
21 When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined,
22 Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and
23 capacities.

24 BACKGROUND FACTS

25 9. The Project will be a freeway/expressway with controlled access that will connect
26 SR-219 near Modesto to SR-120 near Oakdale. It is approximately 22 miles long with a western
27 end at the SR-219 (Kiernan Avenue)/Tully Road intersection near Modesto, and an eastern and at

28 the SR-108/SR-120 intersection near Oakdale. There will be a minimum 244-foot-wide right-of-

PRICE, POSTEL 3 & PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

way, two to three 12-foot-wide through lanes in each direction of the roadway, and 5-foot to 10-

2 foot-wide shoulders. The eastbound and westbound alignments will be separated by a 46-foot to
3 70-foot-wide median. The purpose of the Project is to, inter alia, reduce average daily traffic
4 volumes and current traffic congestion, and accommodate anticipated future traffic on SR-108

5 and the surrounding regional transportation network in the jurisdictions of Real Parties in Interest.

6 10. Caltrans conducted scoping meetings for the Project in September 2010, and

7 published a Notice of Preparation of a draft EIR on August 30, 2010. Public information meetings

8 were then held on June 16, 2011 and March 6, 2014. A public hearing was held on September 7,

9 2017, and Caltrans prepared and circulated a draft EIR for public comment between August 9,
10 2019 and October 16, 2019. After the public comment period, Respondents identified a preferred
11 Project alternative, certified that the Project complies with CEQA, and prepared a Statement of
12 Overriding Considerations after identifying certain unmitigable significant impacts associated
13 with relocation, farmland and noise. The EIR was approved on March 13, 2020. The Notice of
14 Determination ("NOD") was executed on May 22, 2020, and filed with the State Clearinghouse

15 on May 27, 2020.

16 11. The Property is located in what has been designated in the EIR as "Segment 1" of
17 the Project. Although the EIR identifies four Project alternatives (IA, 1B, 2A, and 2B), none of
18 the Project alternatives designate different Project alignments within Segment where the
19 Property is located. Eighteen other Project alternatives were considered in an Alternative Analysis
20 Report, however all were eliminated due to alleged environmental impacts. None of the
21 eliminated Project alternatives, and none of the four Project alternatives in the EIR, address the
22 specific environmental impacts caused by the alignment of the Project with respect to the
23 Property.

24 12. Since 2011 and throughout the environmental review process for the Project,
25 Petitioner, through its authorized representative David O. Romano, P.E., of Newman-Romano,

26 LLC, a California limited liability company ("Romano"), has provided comment letters with
27 respect to the proposed Project and alternatives in an effort to ensure Respondents minimize the
28 Project's environmental impacts on the Property.

PRICE, POSTEI,
& PARMA LLP 4
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. Specifically, Petitioner, through Romano, has repeatedly made clear that a Project
2 alignment approximately a quarter mile south of Claribel A venue should be centered on the

3 southern boundary of the Property. This Project location will result in the lowest impact to
4 adjacent properties by maintaining both their economic viability as agricultural operations, as well
5 as ensuring their future developability.

6 14. Despite Petitioner's repeated comment letters and communications to Caltrans and
7 County, the EIR continues to show the Project alignment with a centerline north of the Property's

8 southern boundary. Even Caltrans and County have admitted that an alignment along the

9 Property's southern boundary line (or even farther south) is a preferable Project alternative, yet
10 the approved Project in the EIR remains north of where it should be located in order to minimize
11 impacts to agricultural resources and to protect future property access and developability.

12 15. In its comment letters, Petitioner consistently pointed out that the Project's
13 proposed alignment creates additional agricultural impacts by reducing the size of remainder
14 parcels on the north side of the alignment to less than desirable agricultural sizes. A Project
15 alignment centered on the Property's southern boundary line (or farther south) will assist in
16 maintaining agricultural viability for property located to the north of the Project, thereby reducing
17 agricultural impacts. Depending on the ultimate location of the Project, the Project as currently
18 designed could sever the Property, creating farming inefficiencies and added costs due to the extra
19 time and fuel required to move from one side of the Project to the other to perform typical
20 I farming operations.

21 16. The Property is also included in the City of Modesto sphere of influence and is
22 planned for urban development. As Petitioner continually pointed out in its comment letters, the
23 EIR does not adequately consider the Project alignment through the Property in order to analyze
24 the impacts to future urban development adjacent to the Project, and whether the remaining
25 parcels have sufficient depth, shape and size to accommodate the planned development and
26 provide adequate access to serve such development.

27 17. Petitioner has also pointed out through comment letters that the right-of-way
28 required for the Project on the Property should be designed to the absolute minimum width

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 5
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

necessary to accomplish the Project goals while keeping as much land in agricultural production

2 and/or available for future development as possible. The right-of-way width of the Project as
3 approved in the EIR is much greater than necessary for the purposes of the Project.

4 18. Finally, Petitioner pointed out that by not moving the Project alignment farther
5 south, and reducing the right-of-way to the minimum size necessary, the Project will negatively

6 impact the ability for future access to the Property from Oakdale Road, which could substantially
7 impact its future developability and value. This will also create substantial severance damages by
8 devaluing the balance of the Property. Nevertheless, the EIR is completely devoid of any analysis

9 to identify how the remaining portion of the Property to the north of the Project will receive
10 access while taking into consideration the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.

11 19. For nearly a decade Petitioner has requested a Project alignment centered on the
12 Property's southern boundary line, or farther south due to the location of the existing Hetch
13 Hetchy right-of-way that traverses the Property, in order to reduce significant environmental
14 impacts to agriculture, future development and access. Respondentsยฎ final action, findings and
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations failed to adequately respond to Petitioner's comments,
16 consider feasible alternatives, and analyze significant environmental impacts.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 19,
19 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

20 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

22 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and
23 Public Resources Code section 21168. This Court also has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in
24 this Petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
25 526 and 1060.

26 22. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project and the Property are located in
27 Stanislaus County, and the environmental impacts of Respondents' actions with respect to the
28 Project and the Property as alleged herein will be felt in Stanislaus County.

1 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

3 23. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 22,

4 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

5 24. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this Petition and

6 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

7 25. Petitioner, by and through its authorized representative Romano, has performed all
8 conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by raising each and every issue known to
9 Petitioner in writing to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21177
10 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.

11 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
12 21167.5 by mailing written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence litigation to Respondents, a
13 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

14 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
15 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
16 relating to this Petition.

17 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
19 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
20 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

21 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28,
23 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

24 30. Respondents filed the NOD on May 27, 2020. Effective April 6, 2020, the
25 California Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9, which suspended the statute of limitations
26 on all civil cases until 90 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency related to the
27 COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the statute of limitations prescribed by Public Resources Code section
28 21167 did not begin to run upon the filing of the NOD.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 7
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. The Judicial Council subsequently amended Emergency Rule 9 to suspend the
2 statutes of limitations for civil causes of action that are 180 days or less from April 6 to August 3,
3 2020. Thus the statute of limitations for filing this Petition began to run on August 3, 2020.
32. This Petition has been brought within 30 days of August 3, 2020, as required by

5 Public Resources Code section 21167.

6 STANDING

7 33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,
8 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

9 34. Petitioner has standing to bring this action because Petitioner owns real property in
10 Stanislaus County and located completely within the Project area. Petitioner is aggrieved by
11 Respondents' actions and has a clear, present and beneficial right to Respondents' proper
12 performance under the mandates of CEQA in the approval and implementation of the Project.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA)

15 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34,
16 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

17 36. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
18 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
19 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant Project impacts.

20 37. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to
21  adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by
22 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by

23 substantial evidence. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the impacts
24 associated with the Project such as significant agricultural impacts caused by the current
25 alignment of the Project, as well as significant impacts to future development of and access to the
26 Property and neighboring properties.

27 38. Respondents' findings violate the requirements of CEQA. The CEQA findings fail
28 to establish whether significant Project impacts are reduced to insignificance or remain significant

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 8
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 even after mitigation. The findings fail to address alternative Project alignments with respect to
2 the Project on and near the Property, and fail to consider whether alternatives could have reduced
3 or avoided Project significant impacts and why certain alternatives that could have lessened the
4 Project's impacts to insignificance were not adopted or otherwise rejected. Finally, the findings
5 are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 39. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
7 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
8 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the

9 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:

12 (a) vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR on the grounds that it

13 violates CEQA;

14 (b) prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate EIR for the Project;

15 (c) vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

16 (d) suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project

17 until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;

18 (e) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the

19 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be

20 necessary to bring their determination, findings or decision regarding the

21 Project into compliance with CEQA;

22 2. For an injunction and order staying the Project approval and prohibiting
23 Respondents from engaging in any physical activity pursuant to the Project until the
24 environmental review and the Project complies with the requirements of CEQA;

25 3. For Petitioner's costs associated with this action;

26 4. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
27 section 1021.5;

28 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This Petition challenges actions by Respondents California Department of
24 Transportation ("Caltrans"), Mr. Toks Omishakin, Director of Caltrans ("Omishakin"), and Mr.
25 Dan McElhinney, Director of Caltrans District 10 ("McElhinney") (collectively "Respondents")
26 in approving the North County Corridor New State Route 108 Project ("Project"), certifying an
27 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project, and adopting findings required under the
28 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L 2.

2 Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the
is Project is invalid and void, and that the EIR prepared for the Project fails to satisfy the
3 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

4 section 15000 et seq.

5 PARTIES

6 3. Petitioner Martin Family Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company
7 ("Petitioner"), owns agricultural real property in the County of Stanislaus consisting of
8 approximately 36 acres and identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers 083-002-001 and 083-002-
9 016 (the "Property"). The Property is located at the southeast corner of Oakdale Road and

10 Claribel Road, and lies completely within the Project area. The Project as approved by
11 Respondents in the EIR will sever the Property in two, causing significant agricultural, traffic and
12 economic impacts that have not been adequately addressed in the EIR through consideration of
13 alternatives or mitigation measures. Since 2011 Petitioner, through its authorized representative,
14 has actively engaged in the administrative proceedings around the Project and its environmental
15 review under CEQA. Petitioner's interests as the owner of the Property will be directly affected
16 by the impacts of the Project. As the owner of the Property, Petitioner has a direct and substantial
17 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to environmental
18 protection, and is adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving
19 the Project.

20 4.

21  "lead Respondent Caltrans is an agency of the State of California. Caltrans is the CEQA
agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Caltrans is responsible for
22 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if

23 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
24 environmental impacts. Caltrans is responsible for implementing and complying with the
25 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.

26 5.

27 Respondent Omishakin is the Director of Caltrans, responsible for all Caltrans
[ actions and decisions, including approval of the Project and certification of its EIR. Respondent
28 | Omishakin is sued in his official capacity. Respondent McElhinney is the Director of Caltrans

SANTA BARBARA, CA 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F District 10 and is sued in his official capacity. As District 10 Director, Respondent McElhinney is

2 responsible for the actions of the Caltrans District where the Project is located.

3 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as
4 Does 1-10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does

5 1-10, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who are responsible in some manner for the

6 conduct described in this Petition, or other individuals, entities or agencies with material interests

7 affected by the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been
8 determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such

9 identities and capacities.

10 7. Real Parties in Interest County of Stanislaus ("County"), City of Oakdale, City of
11 Riverbank, and City of Modesto (collectively, "Real Parties in Interest"), along with Caltrans
12 District 10, collectively represent the North County Corridor Transportation Expressway
13 Authority ("NCCTEA"), which comprise the CBQA "responsible agencies" for the Project. The
14 NCCTEA proposed to construct the Project in conjunction with Respondents. Real Parties in
15 Interest are local agencies that have assisted and cooperated with Respondents in developing the
16 Project and have an interest in the outcome of this litigation.

17 8. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
18 identified as Does 11-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real
19 Parties in Interest Does 11-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who may claim some
20 material interest affected by the Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project.

21 When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined,
22 Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and

23 capacities.

24 BACKGROUND FACTS

25 9. The Project will be freeway/expressway with controlled access that will connect
26 SR-219 near Modesto to SR-120 near Oakdale. It is approximately 22 miles long with a western
27  end at the SR-219 (Kiernan Avenue)/Tully Road intersection near Modesto, and an eastern and at
28 the SR-108/SR-120 intersection near Oakdale. There will be a minimum 244-foot-wide right-of-

PRICE, POSTEL 3 & PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

way, two to three 12-foot-wide through lanes in each direction of the roadway, and 5-foot to 10-
2 foot-wide shoulders. The eastbound and westbound alignments will be separated by a 46-foot to
3 70-foot-wide median. The purpose of the is Project is to, inter alia, reduce average daily traffic
4 volumes and current traffic congestion, and accommodate anticipated future traffic on SR-108
5 and the surrounding regional transportation network in the jurisdictions of Real Parties in Interest.

6 10. Caltrans conducted scoping meetings for the Project in September 2010, and
7 published a Notice of Preparation of a draft EIR on August 30, 2010. Public information meetings

8 were then held on June 16, 2011 and March 6, 2014. A public hearing was held on September 7,
9 2017, and Caltrans prepared and circulated a draft EIR for public comment between August 9,
10 2019 and October 16, 2019. After the public comment period, Respondents identified a preferred

11 Project alternative, certified that the Project complies with CEQA, and prepared a Statement of
12 Overriding Considerations after identifying certain unmitigable significant impacts associated
13 with relocation, farmland and noise. The EIR was approved on March 13, 2020. The Notice of
14 Determination ("NOD") was executed on May 22, 2020, and filed with the State Clearinghouse

15 on May 27, 2020.

16 11. The Property is located in what has been designated in the EIR as "Segment 1" of
17  the Project. Although the EIR identifies four Project alternatives (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B), none of
18 the Project alternatives designate different Project alignments within Segment 1 where the
19 Property is located. Eighteen other Project alternatives were considered in an Alternative Analysis
20 Report, however all were eliminated due to alleged environmental impacts. None of the
21 eliminated Project alternatives, and none of the four Project alternatives in the EIR, address the
22 specific environmental impacts caused by the alignment of the Project with respect to the
23 Property.

24 12. Since 2011 and throughout the environmental review process for the Project,
25 Petitioner, through its authorized representative David O. Romano, P.E., of Newman-Romano,
26 LLC, a California limited liability company ("Romano"), has provided comment letters with

27 respect to the proposed Project and alternatives in an effort to ensure Respondents minimize the
28 Project's environmental impacts on the Property.

PRICE, POSTEI
& PARMA LLP 4
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. Specifically, Petitioner, through Romano, has repeatedly made clear that a Project
2 alignment approximately a quarter mile south of Claribel Avenue should be centered on the
3 southern boundary of the Property. This Project location will result in the lowest impact to
4 adjacent properties by maintaining both their economic viability as agricultural operations, as well

5 as ensuring their future developability.

6 14. Despite Petitioner's repeated comment letters and communications to Caltrans and

7 County, the EIR continues to show the Project alignment with a centerline north of the Property's

8 southern boundary. Even Caltrans and County have admitted that an alignment along the

9 Property's southern boundary line (or even farther south) is a preferable Project alternative, yet
10 the approved Project in the EIR remains north of where it should be located in order to minimize
11 impacts to agricultural resources and to protect future property access and developability.

12 15. In its comment letters, Petitioner consistently pointed out that the Project's
13 proposed alignment creates additional agricultural impacts by reducing the size of remainder
14 parcels on the north side of the alignment to less than desirable agricultural sizes. A Project
15 alignment centered on the Property's southern boundary line (or farther south) will assist in
16 maintaining agricultural viability for property located to the north of the Project, thereby reducing
17 agricultural impacts. Depending on the ultimate location of the Project, the Project as currently
18 designed could sever the Property, creating farming inefficiencies and added costs due to the extra
19 time and fuel required to move from one side of the Project to the other to perform typical
20 farming operations.

21 16. The Property is also included in the City of Modesto sphere of influence and is
22 planned for urban development. As Petitioner continually pointed out in its comment letters, the
23 EIR does not adequately consider the Project alignment through the Property in order to analyze
24 the impacts to future urban development adjacent to the Project, and whether the remaining
25 I parcels have sufficient depth, shape and size to accommodate the planned development and
26 provide adequate access to serve such development.

27 17. Petitioner has also pointed out through comment letters that the right-of-way
28 required for the Project on the Property should be designed to the absolute minimum width

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 5
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P necessary to accomplish the Project goals while keeping as much land in agricultural production

2 and/or available for future development as possible. The right-of-way width of the Project as
3 approved in the EIR is much greater than necessary for the purposes of the Project.

4 18. Finally, Petitioner pointed out that by not moving the Project alignment farther

5 south, and reducing the right-of-way to the minimum size necessary, the Project will negatively

6 impact the ability for future access to the Property from Oakdale Road, which could substantially
7 impact its future developability and value. This will also create substantial severance damages by
8 devaluing the balance of the Property. Nevertheless, the EIR is completely devoid of any analysis
9 to identify how the remaining portion of the Property to the north of the Project will receive

10 access while taking into consideration the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.

11 19. For nearly a decade Petitioner has requested a Project alignment centered on the

12 Property's southern boundary line, or farther south due to the location of the existing Hetch
13 Hetchy right-of-way that traverses the Property, in order to reduce significant environmental
14 impacts to agriculture, future development and access. Respondents' final action, findings and
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations failed to adequately respond to Petitioner's comments,
16 consider feasible alternatives, and analyze significant environmental impacts.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 19,
19 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

20 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

22 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and
23 Public Resources Code section 21168. This Court also has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in
24 this Petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
25 526 and 1060.

26 22. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project and the Property are located in
27 Stanislaus County, and the environmental impacts of Respondents' actions with respect to the
28 Project and the Property as alleged herein will be felt in Stanislaus County.

- EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

3 23. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 22,
4 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

5 24.

6 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this Petition and

7 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

25. Petitioner, by and through its authorized representative Romano, has performed all
8 conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by raising each and every issue known to
9 Petitioner in writing to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21177

10

11 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.

26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
12 21167.5 by mailing written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence litigation to Respondents, a
13 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

14 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
15 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
16 relating to this Petition.

17 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
19 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
20 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

21 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28,
23 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

24 30. Respondents filed the NOD on May 27, 2020. Effective April 6, 2020, the
25 California Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9, which suspended the statute of limitations
26 on all civil cases until 90 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency related to the
27  COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the statute of limitations prescribed by Public Resources Code section
28 21167 did not begin to run upon the filing of the NOD.

PRICE. POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

31. The Judicial Council subsequently amended Emergency Rule 9 to suspend the
2 statutes of limitations for civil causes of action that are 180 days or less from April 6 to August 3,
3 2020. Thus the statute of limitations for filing this Petition began to run on August 3, 2020.
32. This Petition has been brought within 30 days of August 3, 2020, as required by

5 Public Resources Code section 21167.

6 STANDING

7 33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,
g inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

9 34. Petitioner has standing to bring this action because Petitioner owns real property in
10 Stanislaus County and located completely within the Project area. Petitioner is aggrieved by
11 Respondents' actions and has a clear, present and beneficial right to Respondents' proper
12 performance under the mandates of CEQA in the approval and implementation of the Project.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA)

15 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34,
16 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

17 36. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
18 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
19 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant Project impacts.

20 37. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

21 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by

22 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by
23 substantial evidence. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the impacts

24 associated with the Project such as significant agricultural impacts caused by the current
25 alignment of the Project, as well as significant impacts to future development of and access to the
26 Property and neighboring properties.

27 38. Respondents' findings violate the requirements of CEQA. The CEQA findings fail
28 to establish whether significant Project impacts are reduced to insignificance or remain significant

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 8
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

even after mitigation. The findings fail to address alternative Project alignments with respect to

2 the Project on and near the Property, and fail to consider whether alternatives could have reduced

3 or avoided Project significant impacts and why certain alternatives that could have lessened the
4 Project's impacts to insignificance were not adopted or otherwise rejected. Finally, the findings
5 are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 39. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under

7 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
8 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the

9 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:

12 (a) vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR on the grounds that it

13 violates CEQA;

14 (b) prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate EIR for the Project;

15 (c) vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

16 (d) suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project

17 until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;

18 (e) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the

19 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be

22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This Petition challenges actions by Respondents California Department of
24 Transportation ("Caltrans"), Mr. Toks Omishakin, Director of Caltrans ("Omishakin"), and Mr.
25 Dan McElhinney, Director of Caltrans District 10 ("McElhinney") (collectively "Respondents")
26 in approving the North County Corridor New State Route 108 Project ("Project"), certifying an
27 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project, and adopting findings required under the
28 California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 2. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the
2  Project is invalid and void, and that the EIR prepared for the Project fails to satisfy the
3 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

4 section 15000 et seq.

5 PARTIES

6 3. Petitioner Martin Family Holdings, LLC, a California limited liability company
7 ("Petitioner"), owns agricultural real property in the County of Stanislaus consisting of
8 approximately 36 acres and identified by Assessor's Parcel Numbers 083-002-001 and 083-002-

9 016 (the "Property"). The Property is located at the southeast corner of Oakdale Road and
10 Claribel Road, and lies completely within the Project area. The Project as approved by
11 Respondents in the EIR will sever the Property in two, causing significant agricultural, traffic and
12 economic impacts that have not been adequately addressed in the EIR through consideration of
13 alternatives or mitigation measures. Since 2011 Petitioner, through its authorized representative,
14 has actively engaged in the administrative proceedings around the Project and its environmental
15 review under CEQA. Petitioner's interests as the owner of the Property will be directly affected

16 by the impacts of the Project. As the owner of the Property, Petitioner has direct and substantial
17 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to environmental
18 protection, and is adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving
19 the Project.

20 4.

21 Respondent Caltrans is an agency of the State of California. Caltrans is the CEQA

22 "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Caltrans is responsible for
preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
23 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
24 environmental impacts. Caltrans is responsible for implementing and complying with the

25

26 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.

5. Respondent Omishakin is the Director of Caltrans, responsible for all Caltrans
27 actions and decisions, including approval of the Project and certification of its EIR. Respondent

28

PRICE, POSTEL Omishakin is sued in his official capacity. Respondent McElhinney is the Director of Caltrans

ANTA BARBARA, CA 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

District 10 and is sued in his official capacity. As District 10 Director, Respondent McElhinney is

2 responsible for the actions of the Caltrans District where the Project is located.

3 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as
4 Does 1-10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does

5 1-10, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who are responsible in some manner for the

6 conduct described in this Petition, or other individuals, entities or agencies with material interests
7 affected by the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been
8 determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such

9 identities and capacities.

10 7. Real Parties in Interest County of Stanislaus ("County"), City of Oakdale, City of
11 Riverbank, and City of Modesto (collectively, "Real Parties in Interest"), along with Caltrans
12 District 10, collectively represent the North County Corridor Transportation Expressway
13 Authority (*NCCTEA"), which comprise the CEQA "responsible agencies" for the Project. The
14 NCCTEA proposed to construct the Project in conjunction with Respondents. Real Parties in
15 Interest are local agencies that have assisted and cooperated with Respondents in developing the
16 Project and have an interest in the outcome of this litigation.

17 8. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
18 identified as Does 11-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real
19 Parties in Interest Does 11-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies who may claim some
20 material interest affected by the Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project.

21 When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined,
22 Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and
23 capacities.

24 BACKGROUND FACTS

25 9. The Project will be a freeway/expressway with controlled access that will connect
26 SR-219 near Modesto to SR-120 near Oakdale. It is approximately 22 miles long with a western
27 end at the SR-219 (Kiernan Avenue)/Tully Road intersection near Modesto, and an eastern and at
28 the SR-108/SR-120 intersection near Oakdale. There will be a minimum 244-foot-wide right-of-

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 3
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 way, two to three 12-foot-wide through lanes in each direction of the roadway, and 5-foot to 10-
2 foot-wide shoulders. The eastbound and westbound alignments will be separated by a 46-foot to
3 70-foot-wide median. The purpose of the Project is to, inter alia, reduce average daily traffic
4 volumes and current traffic congestion, and accommodate anticipated future traffic on SR-108

5 and the surrounding regional transportation network in the jurisdictions of Real Parties in Interest.

10. Caltrans conducted scoping meetings for the Project in September 2010, and
7 published a Notice of Preparation of a draft EIR on August 30, 2010. Public information meetings
8  were then held on June 16, 2011 and March 6, 2014. A public hearing was held on September 7,

9 2017, and Caltrans prepared and circulated a draft EIR for public comment between August 9,
10 2019 and October 16, 2019. After the public comment period, Respondents identified a preferred
11 Project alternative, certified that the Project complies with CEQA, and prepared a Statement of
12 Overriding Considerations after identifying certain unmitigable significant impacts associated
13 with relocation, farmland and noise. The EIR was approved on March 13, 2020. The Notice of
14 Determination ("NOD") was executed on May 22, 2020, and filed with the State Clearinghouse

15 on May 27, 2020.

16 11. The Property is located in what has been designated in the EIR as "Segment 1" of
17 the Project. Although the EIR identifies four Project alternatives (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B), none of
18 the Project alternatives designate different Project alignments within Segment where the
19 Property is located. Eighteen other Project alternatives were considered in an Alternative Analysis
20 Report, however all were eliminated due to alleged environmental impacts. None of the
21 eliminated Project alternatives, and none of the four Project alternatives in the EIR, address the
22 specific environmental impacts caused by the alignment of the Project with respect to the
23 Property.

24 12. Since 2011 and throughout the environmental review process for the Project,
25 Petitioner, through its authorized representative David O. Romano, P.E., of Newman-Romano,
26 LLC, a California limited liability company ("Romano"), has provided comment letters with
27  respect to the proposed Project and alternatives in an effort to ensure Respondents minimize the
28 Project's environmental impacts on the Property.

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 4
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. Specifically, Petitioner, through Romano, has repeatedly made clear that a Project
2 alignment approximately quarter mile south of Claribel Avenue should be centered on the
3 southern boundary of the Property. This Project location will result in the lowest impact to
4 adjacent properties by maintaining both their economic viability as agricultural operations, as well

5 as ensuring their future developability.

6 14. Despite Petitioner's repeated comment letters and communications to Caltrans and
7 County, the EIR continues to show the Project alignment with a centerline north of the Property's

8 southern boundary. Even Caltrans and County have admitted that an alignment along the
9 Property's southern boundary line (or even farther south) is a preferable Project alternative, yet
10 the approved Project in the EIR remains north of where it should be located in order to minimize

11 impacts to agricultural resources and to protect future property access and developability.

12 15. In its comment letters, Petitioner consistently pointed out that the Project's
13 proposed alignment creates additional agricultural impacts by reducing the size of remainder
14 parcels on the north side of the alignment to less than desirable agricultural sizes. A Project
15 alignment centered on the Property's southern boundary line (or farther south) will assist in
16 maintaining agricultural viability for property located to the north of the Project, thereby reducing
17 agricultural impacts. Depending on the ultimate location of the Project, the Project as currently
18 designed could sever the Property, creating farming inefficiencies and added costs due to the extra
19 time and fuel required to move from one side of the Project to the other to perform typical
20 farming operations.

21 16. The Property is also included in the City of Modesto sphere of influence and is
22 planned for urban development. As Petitioner continually pointed out in its comment letters, the
23 EIR does not adequately consider the Project alignment through the Property in order to analyze
24 the impacts to future urban development adjacent to the Project, and whether the remaining
25 parcels have sufficient depth, shape and size to accommodate the planned development and
26 l provide adequate access to serve such development.

27 17. Petitioner has also pointed out through comment letters that the right-of-way

28 required for the Project on the Property should be designed to the absolute minimum width

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LL.P 5
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P necessary to accomplish the Project goals while keeping as much land in agricultural production

2 and/or available for future development as possible. The right-of-way width of the Project as

3 approved in the EIR is much greater than necessary for the purposes of the Project.

4 18. Finally, Petitioner pointed out that by not moving the Project alignment farther

5 south, and reducing the right-of-way to the minimum size necessary, the Project will negatively

6 impact the ability for future access to the Property from Oakdale Road, which could substantially
7 impact its future developability and value. This will also create substantial severance damages by
8 devaluing the balance of the Property. Nevertheless, the EIR is completely devoid of any analysis
9 to identify how the remaining portion of the Property to the north of the Project will receive
10 access while taking into consideration the Hetch Hetchy right-of-way.

11 19. For nearly a decade Petitioner has requested a Project alignment centered on the
12 Property's southern boundary line, or farther south due to the location of the existing Hetch
13 Hetchy right-of-way that traverses the Property, in order to reduce significant environmental
14 impacts to agriculture, future development and access. Respondents' final action, findings and
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations failed to adequately respond to Petitioner's comments,
16 consider feasible alternatives, and analyze significant environmental impacts.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 20. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs through 19,
19 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

20 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the
22 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and
23 Public Resources Code section 21168. This Court also has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in

24 this Petition seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
25 526 and 1060.

26 22. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project and the Property are located in
27 Stanislaus County, and the environmental impacts of Respondents' actions with respect to the
28 Project and the Property as alleged herein will be felt in Stanislaus County.

6 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

7 25. Petitioner, by and through its authorized representative Romano, has performed all

9 Petitioner in writing to Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21177
10 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.

14 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
15 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
16 relating to this Petition.

17 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
19 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
20 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

21 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs through 28,
23 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

24 30. Respondents filed the NOD on May 27, 2020. Effective April 6, 2020, the
25 California Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9, which suspended the statute of limitations

26 on all civil cases until 90 days after the Governor lifts the state of emergency related to the
27 COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the statute of limitations prescribed by Public Resources Code section
28 21167 did not begin to run upon the filing of the NOD.

& PARMA LLP 7
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. The Judicial Council subsequently amended Emergency Rule 9 to suspend the
2 statutes of limitations for civil causes of action that are 180 days or less from April 6 to August 3,
3 2020. Thus the statute of limitations for filing this Petition began to run on August 3, 2020.

4 32. This Petition has been brought within 30 days of August 3, 2020, as required by
5 Public Resources Code section 21167.

6 STANDING

7 33. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,
g inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

9 34. Petitioner has standing to bring this action because Petitioner owns real property in
10 Stanislaus County and located completely within the Project area. Petitioner is aggrieved by
11 Respondents' actions and has a clear, present and beneficial right to Respondents' proper
12 performance under the mandates of CEQA in the approval and implementation of the Project.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA)

15 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 34,
16 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

17 36. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
18 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for
19 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant Project impacts.

20 37. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to
21 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by
22 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by
23 substantial evidence. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the impacts
24 associated with the Project such as significant agricultural impacts caused by the current
25 alignment of the Project, as well as significant impacts to future development of and access to the
26 Property and neighboring properties.

27 38. Respondents' findings violate the requirements of CEQA. The CEQA findings fail

28 to establish whether significant Project impacts are reduced to insignificance or remain significant

PRICE, POSTEL
& PARMA LLP 8
SANTA BARBARA, CA VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 even after mitigation. The findings fail to address alternative Project alignments with respect to

2 the Project on and near the Property, and fail to consider whether alternatives could have reduced

3 or avoided Project significant impacts and why certain alternatives that could have lessened the

4 Project's impacts to insignificance were not adopted or otherwise rejected. Finally, the findings

5 are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 39. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under

7 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
8 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
9 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:

12 (a) vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR on the grounds that it

13 violates CEQA;

14 (b) prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate EIR for the Project;

15 (c) vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

16 (d) suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project

17 until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;

18 (e) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the

19 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be

20 necessary to bring their determination, findings or decision regarding the

21 Project into compliance with CEQA;

22 2. For an injunction and order staying the Project approval and prohibiting

23 Respondents from engaging in any physical activity pursuant to the Project until the
24 environmental review and the Project complies with the requirements of CEQA;

25 3. For Petitioner's costs associated with this action;

26 4. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
27 section 1021.5;

28 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
