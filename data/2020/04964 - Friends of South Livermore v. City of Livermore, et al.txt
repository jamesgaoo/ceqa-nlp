Case No.

f

1 INTRODUCTION

2 With this lawsuit, Petitioner FRIENDS OF SOUTH LIVERMORE ( or "Petitioner")

3 challenges actions by Respondent CITY OF LIVERMORE ("City"), taken by and through its

4 City Council on January 13, 2020, approving Site Plan Design Review and a Conditional Use
5 Permit for the Wine Country Inn Project, an approximately 29,345 square foot hotel and

6 restaurant and 2,300 square foot caretaker's unit in South Livermorc ("Project"). The current
7 landowner is Real Party In Interest Alameda County Surplus Property Authority, and the Project

8 developers and proponents are Real Parties in Interest LWCI, LLC, and MICHELLE BOSS
9 (collectively "Real Parties"). In approving the Project, the City adopted a Mitigated Ncgative
10 Declaration pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Resources

11 Code § 21000 et seq., finding that the Project would have no significant unmitigated
12 environmental impacts.

13 FOSL contends the City approved the Project in violation of applicable provisions of the
14 State Planning and Zoning Law, Gov't Code § 65000 et seq., by approving the Project
15 notwithstanding its substantial and material inconsistencies and incompatibilities with the goals,

16 policies, and standards set forth in the Livermore General Plan, the South Livermore Valley
17 Specific Plan, and applicable provisions of the Livermore Municipal Code.

18 FOSL further contends the City prejudicially abused its discretion by relying on a

19 Mitigated Negative Declaration in lieu of preparing a full environmental impact report ("EIR")
20 for the Project. Under CEQA, if there is substantial evidence in the administrative record before
21 a public agency that a proposed project may have a significant impact on the environment, the
22 agency must prepare an EIR, even if other substantial evidence shows the project will have no

23 such impact. In this case, there is substantial evidence in the record before the City that the
24 Project not only may but will have several significant environmental effects, most notably in the
25 areas of visual resources, traffic, noise, public safety, and cumulative impacts generally. The City
26 therefore had a mandatory duty under CEQA to prepare and circulate an EIR before approving
27 the Project

1 FOSL accordingly seeks a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure

2 sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, commanding the City to set aside its approvals of the Project's
3 entitlements, specifically Site Plan and Design Review No. SPDR 19-004 and Conditional Use
4 Permit No. CUP 19-006, and to reconsider its actions after only after preparing and circulating a
5 draft EIR for public review and comment in accordance with CEQA, and only after addressing
6 the Project's inconstancies with the Livermore General Plan, the South Livermore Valley Specific
7 Plan, and the Livermore Municipal Code. FOSL further seeks a stay of the effect of the City's
8 approvals during the pendency of these proceedings. Finally, FOSL seeks an award of costs and
9 attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, together with any other relief the
10 Court deems necessary and proper.
11 In support whereof, FOSL alleges:
12 PARTIES

13 Friends of South Livermore

14 1. Petitioner Friends of South Livermore (FOSL) is an unincorporated association of

15 citizens, property owners, taxpayers, and electors residing in the City of Livermore, Alameda

16 County. Its organizational purpose includes advocating for just, equitable and responsible land

17 use planning and policy, as well as diligent enforcement of planning and environmental laws in

18 and around Livermore, and particularly in the South Livermore Valley.

2.
19 FOSL's members include, but are not limited to, Peter Young, Ann Spies-Young,

20 and Donna Cabanne, all of whom are adult citizens of Livermore living near the Project site.
3.
21 FOSL's members maintain a direct and regular geographic nexus with the City of
Livermore and the Project vicinity, and will therefore suffer direct harm as a result of any adverse 22 environmental and/or public safety impacts caused by the Project.
23

24 4. FOSL's constituents have a clear and present right to, and beneficial interest in, the

25 City's performance of its duties to comply with the State Planning & Zoning Law, CEQA, and

26 the Livermore Municipal Code. As Livermore residents, homeowners, taxpayers, workers,

27 and/or electors, FOSL's constituents arc within the class of persons to whom the City owes such

28 duties.

L †

1 5. By this action, FOSL seeks to protect the interests of its constituents and

2 supporters and to enforce a public duty owed to them by the City. Becausc the claims asserted

3 and the relief sought in this petition are broad-based and of a public as opposed to a purely

4 private or pecuniary nature, direct participation in this litigation by FOSL's individual

5 constituents and supporters is not necessary.

6 6. FOSL and/or its constituents and legal counsel presented oral and/or written

7 comments in opposition to the Project prior to and/or during the public hearings culminating in

8 the City's January 13, 2010 action approving the Project, and cither raised, seconded, or
9 supported all objections by other individuals and organizations to the Project and alleged
10 grounds for noncompliance with applicable laws as presented herein.
11 City of Livermore

12 7. Respondent CITY OF LIVERMORE (City) is a California General Law City
13 situated in Alameda County. On January 13, 2020 the City, acting through its City Council,
14 adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration and approved Site Plan Design Review and a
15 Conditional Use Permit for the Project described herein.

16 8. At all times relevant to this Petition, the City served as the "lead agency" under

17 CEQA responsible for evaluating the potential environmental impacts of the Project before
18 approving it.
19 Alameda County Surplus Property Authority

20 9. Real Party In Interest ALAMEDA COUNTY SURPLUS PROPERTY

21 AUTHORITY is a public corporation within the County of Alameda, duly constituted under

22 Government Code section 40520.

23 10. FOSL is informed and believes that the ALAMEDA COUNTY SURPLUS

24 PROPERTY OWNER remains the fee simple owner of the 3.2-acre Project site parcel (APN
25 #99-460-8) pending sale of the arcel to Real Parties In Interest LWCI, LLC, and/or Michelle
26 Boss.

27 LWCI, LLC

28 11. FOSL is informed and believes that Real Party In Interest LWCI, LLC, is a

1 California limited liability company maintaining its principal place of business in Livermore,

2 Alameda County. FOSL is further informed and believes that LWCI, LLC. is a sponsor and
3 developer of the Project, and was an applicant for and recipient of the land use entitlements
4 challenged herein.

5 Michelle Boss

6 12. FOSL is informed and believes that Real Party In Interest MICHELLE BOSS is
7 an adult individual domiciled in Alameda County. FOSL is further informed and believes that
8 MICHELLE BOSS is a sponsor and developer of the Project, and was an applicant for and
9 recipient of the land use entitlements challenged herein.
10 Does

11 13. FOSL currently does not know the true names of Real Parties in Interest DOES

12 through 25 inclusive, and therefore names them by such fictitious names. FOSL will seek lcave
13 from the court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and capacities of DOES 1
14 if through 25 inclusive if and when ascertained.
15 IURISDICTION & VENUE

16 14. This action is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or
17 1094.5. Venue is proper in Alameda County under Code of Civil Procedute sections 393 and 395.

18 FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

19 15. The Project site is a vacant 3.2 acre parcel at the southwest corner of Arroyo Road
20 and Hansen Road in the agricultural area of the South Livermore Valley. It is surrounded by
21 viticulture use.

22 16. The Projcct consists of the development of the site with an approximately 29,345-
23 squarc foot, two-story building to house a 30-room Livermore Valley Wine Country Inn.
24 | Development would include a 77-seat restaurant, wine bar, wine terrace, meeting rooms, a
25 caretaker's housing unit, 61 paved vehicle parking spaces, 12 bicycle parking spaces, and
26 associated site improvements.

27 17. Real Parties applied for land use development entitlements for the Project

28 sometime in 2019.

Sass Francisco, CA 94102 (415) 369-9400 Friends of South Livermore v. City of Livermorc
Case No.
- 4 -

1 18. In September 2019, the City circulated a draft Initial Study/Mitigated Negative

2 Declaration ("IS/MND") for the Project for public review and comment. The IS/MND
concluded the Project would have no significant unmitigated environmental impacts. The
4 IS/MND concluded the Project was fully consistent with all applicable land use regulations

5 governing the site.

6 19. Various individuals and organizations including one or more of FOSL's

7 constituents and supporters submitted timely written comments on the draft IS/MND, objecting

8 to its analysis and/or its conclusions.
9 20. On November: 5, 2019 the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on

10 the Project. Various individuals and organizations, including FOSL and/or its individual

11 constituents objected to approval of the Project orally and/or in writing prior to the close of the

12 public hearing. After closing the hearing, the Planning Commission voted to adopt the IS/MND
13 and approve the Project entitlements challenged herein.
14 21. FOSL timely appealed the Planning Commission's action to the City Council

15 pursuant to the appeal provisions of the Livermore Municipal Code.
16 22. On January 13, 2019 the City Council likewise held a public hearing on FOSL's
17 appeal. Again, various individuals and organizations, including FOSL and/or its individual
18 constituents, supporters, and legal counsel objected to the adoption of the IS/MND and
19 approval of the Project orally and/or in writing prior to the close of this public hearing and

20 raised, seconded, or affirmed the alleged legal violations raised herein. After closing the hearing,
21 the City Council adopted Resolution No. 26-19 denying FOSL's appeal, adopting the IS/MND,

22 and approving the Project entitlements. In so doing, the City Council added new conditions of

23 approval that purported to address some of the concerns FOSL had raised in its appeal.
24 23. Resolution No. 26-19 includes findings that the Project is fully consistent with the
25 Livermore General Plan, South Livermore Valley Specific Plan, Planned Unit Development
26 Amendment No. PUDA 01-001, and the Livermore Municipal Code.

27 24. On January 14, 2020 thc City posted a notice of determination in accordance with

28 Public Resources Code section 21152, which listed "Livermore Wine Country Inn, LLC" as the

3 identified the actual Project Applicant, LWCI, LLC as "Livermore Wine Country Inn, LLC.3
4 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

5 (Violations of State Planning & Zoning Law)

6 26. FOSL here incorporates by reference all preceding paragtaphs in their entirety.

7 27. Under the State Planning and Zoning law, Government Code $S 65000 et seq., a

8 local public agency may entitle a proposed land use only if the land use is consistent with the

9 goals, policies, and objectives contained in a valid, current, internally consistent General Plan,

10 including any applicable subsidiary specific plans and/or planned unit development approvals.

11 28. The Project site is subject to the goals, policies, and objectives of the 2003-2025

12 Livermore General Plan ("General Plan"), the South Livermore Valley Specific Plan ("SLVSP"),

13 the Livermore Municipal Code, and Planned Unit Development Amendment ("PUDA") No. 01-

14 001.

15 29. The Project is inconsistent and incompatible with governing goals, policies, and

16 programs of the General Plan, SLVSP, Municipal Code, and PUDA No. 01-001. The Project's

17 inconsistencies and incompatibilities with these planning documents include, but are not

18 necessarily limited to, violations of the roadway setback requirements contained in the SLVSP;

19 violations of the commercial design standards and guidelines contained in the SLVSP; violations

20 of the land use restrictions contained in the SLVSLP and PUDA 01-001; and violation of the

21. parking requirements of the Livermore Municipal Code.

22 30. Despite these inconsistencies, the City in approving the Project's land use

23 entitlements adopted findings that the Project is fully consistent with the General Plan, SLVSP,

24 Municipal Code, and PUDA 01-001.

25 31. 'The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project

26 notwithstanding these inconsistencies and incompatibilitics, and by adopting findings of

27 consistency that are clearly erroneous and not supported by substantial evidence.

1 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEE

2 (Violation of CEQA)

3 1. FOSL here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

4 2. At all times relevant to this action the City was the "lead agency" responsible for

5 the review and approval of the Project under Public Resources Code section 21067.

6 3. Under Public Resources Code section 21080(d), if there is substantial evidence in

7 light of the whole record before a lead agency that a discretionaty project it intends to carry out

8 may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency must prepare an EIR.

9 4. Under Public Resources Code section 21080(c)(1), a lead agency may adopt a

10 negative declaration for a project, only if an initial study shows there is no substantial evidence in

11 light of the whole record beforc the agency that the project may have a significant effect on the

12 a environment. In other words, if a lead agency is presented with a "fair argument" that a project

13 may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR, even

14. though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have a

15 significant effect. No Oil, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal. 3d 68; 14 Cal. Code. Regs. §

16 15064(f)(1).

17 5. For purposes of CEQA, "substantial evidence" is defined as including: "facts,

18 reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts." 14

19 Cal.Code.Regs § 15064(f) (5). Relevant personal observations of area residents on nontechnical

20 subjects can qualify as substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that an EIR should be

21 prepared. Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 928. For example, an

22 adjacent property owner may testify to traffic or noise conditions based upon personal

23 knowledge. Keep Our Mountains Quiet y County of Santa Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714, 730.

24 6. Here, there is substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the City that

25 the Project not only may but will have significant direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the

26 environment, in areas including but not limited to traffic and circulation, public safety, noise,

27 aesthetics and visual resources, and biological resources. The City therefore had a mandatory

1 duty under CEQA to prepare and circulate a full EIR for the Project before taking any action to
2 approve it.

3 7. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project

4 based only on a Mitigated Negative Declaration.

5 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

6 8. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
7 section 1094.5. FOSL and/or its constituents, supporters, and/or legal counsel objected to the

8 City's approvals of the Project orally or in writing prior to the close of the final public hearing on

9 the Project. FOSL raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing,

10 or seconded or affirmed those raised by others, prior to the close of the City Council's final

11 public hearing on the Project.

12 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

13 9. FOSL declares that it has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
14 course of law for the improper action of the City.
15 NEWLY PRODUCED EVIDENCE

16 10. In accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(e), FOSL may, prior to
17 or during the hearing on this petition, offer additional relevant evidence that could not, in the

18 exercise of reasonable diligence, have been produced at: the administrative hearing.
19 ATTORNEYS FEES

20 11. FOSL is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided under Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit
22 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and

23 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

24 PRAYER

25 WHEREFORE, FOSI. prays for entry of judgment as follows:

26 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City:
