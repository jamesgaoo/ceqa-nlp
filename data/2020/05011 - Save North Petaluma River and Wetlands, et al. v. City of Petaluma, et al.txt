Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioners SAVE NORTH PETALUMA RIVER AND WETLANDS and BEVERLY

3 ALEXANDER (collectively "Petitioners") petition this court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"),

4 directed to Respondents CITY OF PETALUMA, CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PETALUMA

5 ("City Council"), and PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF PETALUMA ("Planning

6 Commission") (collectively "Respondents" or the "City") and Real Party in Interest J. CYRIL

7 JOHNSON INVESTMENT CORPORATION ("Real Party" or "Applicant"), and by this verified

8 petition, alleges as follows:

9 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

10 approving the Sid Commons Apartment Project ("Project") because the Final Environmental Impact

11 Report ("FEIR") failed to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act

12 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code
13 of Regulations, § 15000 et seq. The specific actions challenged are: (1) certification of the FEIR for thé

14 Project; (2) adoption of related findings and mitigation monitoring plan; and (3) approval of the Project

15 including the Zoning Map Amendment and Oak Creek Apartments Planned Unit District Amendment

16 and covering future Vesting Tentative Parcel Map and Site Plan and Architectural Review.
17 2. Because the FEIR violates several of CEQA's requirements, the approvals that are reliant

18 upon it must be overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct Respondents

19 to set aside the certification of the FEIR and associated Project approvals.

20 PARTIES

21 3. Petitioner SAVE NORTH PETALUMA RIVER AND WETLANDS is an unincorporated

22 association with its headquarters in Petaluma, California. The mission of SAVE NORTH PETALUMA

23 RIVER AND WETLANDS is to preserve the Petaluma River's natural habitat and wetlands, which are

24 critical for both wildlife and public safety. Members of SAVE NORTH PETALUMA RIVER AND

25 WETLANDS live near the Project and have several legally cognizable interests in the Project and will

26 be negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts and improper approval. Members

27 of SAVE NORTH PETALUMA RIVER AND WETLANDS provided written and oral comments on the

28 inadequacy of the FEIR and Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") (collectively, "EIR") during

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 the administrative approval process. The interests of SAVE NORTH PETALUMA RIVER AND

3 WETLANDS and its members are unique and will be directly impacted by the Project. SAVE NORTH

4 PETALUMA RIVER AND WETLANDS brings this action on behalf of itself, its members, and in the

5 public interest. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the

6 public by protecting the public from the procedural, environmental, and other harms alleged herein.

4.

7 Petitioner BEVERLY ALEXANDER is a resident of Petaluma, CA as well a as a member

8 of Save North Petaluma River and Wetlands. Ms. Alexander provided oral comments to Respondents
during the administrative approval process.

9 5.

10 Respondent CITY OF PETALUMA is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction the
Project will be located.

11 6.

12 Respondent the CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PETALUMA ("City Council")

13 serves as the legislative body of the City of Petaluma for the planning and provision of services related

14 to public needs and the requirements of state laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the
City of Petaluma, the members of the City Council establish overall City priorities and set policy.
15 Respondent City Council is the governing body of the City, and is ultimately responsible for reviewing
16

17 and approving or denying the Project. The City Council voted on February 3, 2020 to approve the
Project, including certification of the FEIR.

18 7.

19 Respondent PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF PETALUMA (Planning
Commission") has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review for the Project and
20 taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.
21 8.

22 Real Party in Interest J. CYRIL JOHNSON INVESTMENT CORPORATION is a

23 California a corporation with a principal place of business at 125 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9.

25 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

26 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and
21168.5.

27 10.

28 Venue is proper in Sonoma County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Sonoma.

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 11. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure §§394 (actions

2 against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally) because Respondents include a city

3 and local agencies based in the County of Sonoma and because the cause of action alleged in this

4 Petition arose in the County of Sonoma and the Project will occur within the County of Sonoma.

5 STANDING

6 12. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they are

7 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Petitioners

8 have direct and beneficial interests in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the
9 Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as

10 set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of

11 life in the surrounding community. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the

12 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA when
13 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.
14 13. Petitioners actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process in an

15 attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws.

16 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

17 14. Petitioners have performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

18 Petition. Petitioners have actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

19 prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice of

20 determination. Petitioners have fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

21 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

22 15. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all

23 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th

24 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written

25 comments on the Project, and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

26 16. Respondents have taken final agency actions certifying the FEIR and adopting the related

27 approvals. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but not
28 limited to CEQA prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners

3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

possess no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this

2 lawsuit.

3 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

4 17. On March 6, 2020, Petitioners served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit, in

LO accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1: Notice of Intent to File

6 Petition Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.)

7 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

8 18. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioners elect
9 to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. (See Exhibit 2: Petitioners' Notice of Intent to

10 Prepare Record.)

11 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

12 19. Petitioners bring this action as private attorney generals pursuant to Code of Civil

13 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting
14 the public interest.

15 20. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the
16 general public by requiring Respondents to carry out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws
17 before approving the Project.

18 21. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
19 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally adequate
20 analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and
21 comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

22 22. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees
23 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party will proceed with a plan and
24 development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise have
25 been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible
26 mitigation measures.

27 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

28 23. Petitioners assert that Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously when certifying the

4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P FEIR and approving the Project.

2 24. In accordance with Government Code section 800, and other applicable laws, Petitioners

3 are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to overturn Respondents' arbitrary or

4 capricious actions.
5 IRREPARABLE HARM

6 25. Petitioners and its members live and/or work near the Project site and in the County of

7 Sonoma and the City of Petaluma. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents'

8 failure to provide environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the
9 Project's true impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental
10 decision-making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business

11 owners in the affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project.
12 26. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

13 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval

14 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in

15 violation of State law and Petitioners will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal

16 remedy could fully and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

17 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

18 27. On March 1, 2018, the City released the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR")

19 for public review and comment describing a Project including Planned Unit District ("PUD")
20 Amendment, Zoning Map Amendment, Vesting Tentative Parcel Map, and Site Plan and Architectural
21 Review to allow the construction of a 278-unit apartment complex within three-story structures, along

22 with a community clubhouse and an outdoor swimming pool, located on the approximately 15.45-acre

23 net developable portion of the Project site located directly on the Petaluma River. Primary access to the

24 Project was to be via a proposed extension of Shasta Avenue, which would include an at-grade crossing

25 of the railroad tracks adjacent to the Project site. The project included terracing above the ordinary
26 high-water line of the west bank of the Petaluma River.

27 28. In October 2019, the City released the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for
28 the Project. The project analyzed in the FEIR differed from what was analyzed in the DEIR. The

5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- project analyzed in the FEIR included 205 apartment units in multiple two-story buildings, rather than

2 multiple three-story buildings. The project analyzed in the FEIR was sited to remove residential

3 development from the three Petaluma River Plan Corridor management zones. The project analyzed in

4 the FEIR also proposed that 10% of units would be affordable housing. The project no longer sought to

5 extend Shasta Avenue via an at-grade crossing, and instead relied on Graylawn Avenue as a single

6 access point. In addition, the project analyzed in the FEIR included a dog park and a traffic calming

7 plan.

8 29. On November 19, 2019, the Planning Commission voted to approve Resolution No.
2019-21 recommending the City Council certify the FEIR for the Project. At the same meeting, the
10 Planning Commission voted against recommending that the City Council approve the associated
11 Zoning Map Amendment and modifications to the Oak Creek Apartments PUD.

12 30. Petitioner Beverley Alexander, a member of Save North Petaluma River and Wetlands,
13 submitted oral comments regarding the environmental impacts of the Project at the November 19, 2019
14 meeting of the Planning Commission.

15 31. The Applicant appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the City Council.

16 32. On January 27, 2020, Rebecca Davis of Lozeau Drury LLP submitted a letter to the City
17 Council requesting that the City Council continue the Applicant's Appeal of Planning Commission's
18 decision from February 3, 2020 to February 17, 2020. The letter noted that several key interested
19 parties, including the Casa Grande Anglers Club, Friends of the Petaluma River, and Clavey Sports,
20 were never notified of the Project or any related EIR or hearing. The letter also noted that the EIR
21 needed to be recirculated prior to any City Council decision because the FEIR analyzed an entirely new
22 project which was never analyzed in the DEIR, that the public had not had an opportunity to comment
23 on new traffic studies in the FEIR indicating that traffic near the Project would be much worse than
24 previously analyzed, and that the Project now included dog park that was not analyzed in the DEIR or

25 the FEIR. Additionally, the letter argued that it was premature for the City Council to hear the appeal
26 given that the Applicant, in their appeal, stated that they were still considering "major modifications to
27 the project."

28 33. On February 3, 2020, a Staff Report to the City Council disclosed that the Applicant

6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 submitted a further-revised concept plan to the City on January 8, 2020. The public was only given

2 information about the new concept plan when it was released as an attachment to the Staff Report for

3 the City Council meeting at which the Applicant sought approval of the Project. The newly described

4 Project included 180 residential units in 11 buildings, which would all be three-story buildings, except

5 in areas directly abutting existing single-family homes, which would be two-story buildings ("Revised

6 Project"). Ten percent of the units would be low-income. The Revised Project included only a single

7 point of ingress and egress via Graylawn Avenue and included a dog park, a children's playground, and

8 a traffic calming plan.

9 34. On February 1, 2020, Ruth Pratt, a retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist,

10 submitted a comment to the City Council via email. Ms. Pratt noted that the Project would result in

11 significant adverse impacts to waters of the United States and State and associated fish and wildlife

12 resources, requiring review and oversight by Federal and State regulatory agencies. Ms. Pratt

13 commented that the proposed dredging and terracing of the river channel and removal of riparian

14 vegetation would destroy habitat for special-status species, such as chinook salmon and steelhead trout,
15 through direct loss and degradation from siltation and turbidity. Ms. Pratt further commented that the

16 Project would result in runoff of nonpoint source pollutants into the Petaluma River, which is listed as

17 an impaired water body on the Clean Water Act 303(d) list due to elevated fecal indicator bacterial

18 levels. Additionally, Ms. Pratt found that the Project would undermine the 40-year restoration efforts by

19 local anglers to conserve and restore the area of the river around the Project site and, furthermore,

20 seasonal wetlands would be lost. Ms. Pratt also raised concerns as to the cumulative impacts to seasonal

21 wetlands as a result of the Project in combination with the existing outlet mall and the cumulative

22 impacts to flooding.

23 35. On February 3, 2020, Petaluma residents submitted a written comment to the City

24 Council in opposition to the FEIR ("February 3, 2020 comment"). The February 3, 2020 comment

25 urged the City Council to refrain from adopting the FEIR because the projects and alternatives

26 proposed, described, and analyzed in the DEIR and FEIR were different than the Revised Project which

27 the City Council was now considering. The February 3, 2020 comment argued that the shifting project
28 description precluded the public from being able to meaningfully participate in the environmental

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P review process. The February 3, 2020 comment also noted that the City Council could not rely on the

2 DEIR or FEIR's environmental analysis of various alternatives to justify the adoption of the Revised

3 Project where the DEIR and FEIR made no mention of such a project, even if the alternatives analyzed

4 would have greater environmental impacts.

5 36. The February 3, 2020 comment also included an expert comment letter from Certified

6 Industrial Hygienist, Francis Offermann, PE, CIH. Mr. Offermann raised concerns about significant

7 impacts from formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products used for construction. Mr.

8 Offermann calculated that, even if composite woods products used for the Project were compliant with

9 the most recent standards of the California Air Resources Board, future residents of the Project would
10 a be exposed to a cancer risk from formaldehyde of 112 per million, more than eleven times over the Bay

million. Mr. 11 Area Air Quality Management District's CEQA significance threshold of 10 per

12 Offermann also noted that the indoor air quality impacts would likely be exacerbated by the additional
13 cancer risk that exists as a result of the Project's location near roads with moderate to high traffic (e.g.
14 Highway 101/116, Petaluma Boulevard, etc.) as well as being located only feet away from an active
15 railroad track.

16 37. The February 3, 2020 comment also included an expert comment letter from Professor

17 Thomas Cova, Ph.D., an expert in evacuations who studies the nexus of hazards, transportation, and

18 geographic information science. Professor Cova concluded that the additional vehicles that would need

19 to evacuate onto Payran Avenue as a result of the Project may create a significant public safety impact.
20 In the event of an evacuation, all future residents of the Project would exit the site onto Graylawn

21 Avenue, and then either continue straight on Graylawn Avenue to Payran Street or turn left onto Jess

22 Avenue which then connects to Payran Street. Professor Cova noted that the hundreds of new residents

23 and 1,591 cars created by the Project would be in addition to the more than two hundred existing

24 households the community and could generate over four hundred vehicles during an evacuation. As a

25 result, Payran Avenue would become a bottleneck if the Project area were to be evacuated. Professor

26 Cova concluded that the single point of egress could create a significant public safety impact which was
27 not addressed by the DEIR or FEIR.

28 38. The February 3, 2020 comment also included the expert comment of Ms. Kallie Kull

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

who concluded that the EIR failed to establish an accurate baseline from which to analyze or mitigate

2 impacts related to wetlands. According to the DEIR, a wetland assessment was conducted by the City's

3 consultant in 2012, confirmed by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 2013, and expired in 2017. The

4 FEIR stated that the wetland delineation was reconfirmed by the Army Corps of Engineers in January

5 2019; however, Ms. Kull noted that the 2019 confirmation was an office exercise made without a

6 representative from the Corps conducting site visit. As such, Ms. Kull concluded that wetland

7 delineation was outdated and could not be used as an accurate baseline for calculation of area impacts

8 to wetlands or area of mitigation for temporary/permanent loss of wetlands

9 39. The February 3, 2020 comment also noted that the FEIR did not adequately analyze or

10 mitigate impacts to biological resources. The FEIR contained findings that, prior to implementing

11 mitigation, the Project would have significant impacts on special-status birds, bats, reptiles,

12 amphibians, and fish. However, the DEIR and FEIR provided no evidence of how significant those

13 impacts may be, or the extent of necessary mitigation. The comment noted that the failure of the FEIR

14 or DEIR to include a biological survey from the past 19 years, or even a report prepared by a biologist, .

15 precluded informed decision making and informed public participation. The comment also noted that

16 the underlying data and reports relied on to support the EIR's conclusions about special status species

17 are nearly two decades old, thereby failing to establish a proper baseline from which to analyze the

18 Project's impacts. Moreover, there never had been a site inspection for special status plant species. The

19 comment concluded that the EIR's analysis of biological resource impacts was nothing more than a set

20 of conclusions, based on a stale site assessment that itself was inadequate and took place nearly 20

21 years ago. The comment also noted that there was no expert evidence in the record containing analysis

22 of mitigation measures which would reduce the Project's impacts to biological resources below the

23 level of significance. Thus, the EIR contained only a bare conclusion that the Project's impacts on

24 biological species would be fully mitigated with the imposition of the proposed mitigation measure
25 without any supporting expert evidence. The comment also argued that the EIR failed to adequately

26 disclose and analyze the Project's cumulative impact on biological resources. The comment noted that

27 the EIR did not mention a single past, present, or future project that it evaluated cumulatively with the

28 Project's biological impacts. As such, without any information on what - if any -- cumulative projects

9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 were considered, and what environmental impacts those cumulative projects have, the public and

3 decision makers lacked the necessary information on which to assess the validity of the cumulative

4 impact conclusions under CEQA. The comment also pointed out that a conclusion that the Project will

5 have no cumulative impact because each individual impact would be reduced to a less-than-significant
level is inconsistent with the requirements of CEQA.

6 40.

7 Lastly, the February 3, 2020 comment noted that, if a mitigation measure itself would

8 cause environmental impacts distinct from the significant impacts caused by the Project, such impacts
are required to be discussed in an EIR. Specifically, the comment pointed to the Project's traffic
9 calming plan as creating a significant impact that was not disclosed or analyzed in the EIR. Expert Ms.
10

11 Kull noted that "[b]ulb outs, speed bumps and roundabouts would all be considered impediments to

12 stormwater run-off in this neighborhood. Proposed structures would be built directly on the roadway

13 surface and interrupt sheet flow and gutter flow in the street, causing water to back up and pool on the

- street, intersections, and residential properties." As a result, Ms. Kull concluded that the proposed
14 traffic calming plan would increase the risk of flooding for the Payran neighborhood and its residents.
15

16 Ms. Kull also noted that impacts from the dog park may arise as a result of loss of riparian habitat,

17 impacts to water quality from dog feces, and parking and human garbage associated with the park.
41.

18 Council. On February 3, 2020, the Applicant's appeal and the FEIR came before the City

19 42.

20 At and prior to the February 3, 2020 City Council hearing, additional written and oral

21 comments were made by members of the public. These public comments included: (1) the FEIR failed

22 to analyze cumulative flood risks resulting from past, present, and future development in flood prone

23 areas along the Petaluma River; (2) the FEIR failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project

24 together with the existing past outlet mall, auto dealer, and the Barlow center; (3) the FEIR failed to

25 analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project together with the reasonable foreseeable future

26 development on Cinnabar Avenue as well as the Rainier connector; (4) the FEIR failed to analyze the

27 cumulative impacts of the Project and other development on the Army Corps dam near the Project site

28 that would result from the development and from terracing, which would create increased hydraulic
pressure on the dam; (5) the FEIR failed to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts to special-status

10
erified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F fish species; and (6) the FEIR failed to disclose, discuss, analyze, and mititgate the presence of mercury

2 and methyl mercury in the soil on the Project site.

3 43. On February 3, 2020, the City Council voted to certify the FEIR and approve the PUD

4 Amendment and Zoning Map Amendment, and covering a future Vesting Tentative Parcel Map and

5 Site Plan and Architectural Review for the Revised Project.

6 44. On February 5, 2020, the City posted the Notice of Determination for the City Council's

7 February 3, 2020 approvals for the Project.

8 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA

9 45. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse

10 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing the

11 significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

12 46. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment . . . shall be the

13 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (PRC §21001(d).) CEQA requires

14 environmental factors to be considered at the "earliest stage . . . before [the project] gains irreversible
15 I momentum," Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284 n.28, "at a point in the planning process

16 where genuine flexibility remains." (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296,

17 307 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) Moreover, "the 'foremost principle' in
18 interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible

19 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for

20 a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

21 47. CEQA generally requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any project

22 that may have a significant effect on the environment to identify those effects, alternatives to the
23 project, and mitigation of the effects. (PRC §§21002.1(a), 21061, 21100(a).)

24 48. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental effects of its

25 proposed actions in an EIR if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead

26 agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (PRC §21080(d).) A
27 "project" is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken or supported by a public agency "which may

28 cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- change in the environment." (PRC §21065; CCR §15378(a).)

2 49. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

4 and the public about a project's environmental effects. (14 CCR §15002(a)(1).) "The EIR process

5 protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights Improvement

6 Ass'n y. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

50.

7 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to identify ways to avoid or reduce

8 environmental damage and prevent such damage "by requiring changes in projects through the use of
alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible."

10 (14 CCR §15002(a)(2), (3).) Put another way, "agencies are required to give major consideration to

11 preventing environmental damage" and "should not approve a project as proposed if there are feasible

12 alternatives or mitigation measures available that would substantially lessen any significant effects that

13 the project would have on the environment." (14 CCR §15021(a).)

51. CEQA requires the lead agency to conduct an "initial study" with respect to
14 environmental effects. (14 CCR §15063(a).) The initial study must describe "the environmental

15 setting" of the Project. (14 CCR §15063(d)(2).)

16 52.

17 CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze all significant environmental effects of its

18 proposed actions in an BIR. (PRC §21100(b)(1); 14 CCR §15126(a).) The EIR must not only identify

19 the effects, but must also provide "information about how adverse the adverse impact will be."

20 (Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 831.)
53.

21 "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative

22 and legally adequate EIR." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,

23 192.) "[A] curtailed or distorted project description," on the other hand, "may stultify the objectives of

24 the reporting process. Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public

25 decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental costs, consider mitigation

26 measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e., the "no project" alternative) and weigh

27 other alternatives in the balance." (Id.; see also, CEQA Guidelines §15124.) The proposed project must

28 be described in the draft EIR. If it is only described in the FEIR and not the DEIR, the public is
deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the project. Significant changes to

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

the project after the close of the comment period on the DEIR renders the DEIR so fundamentally and

2 basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were

3 precluded. (Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish and Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043).

4 54. The EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the project that may be "cumulatively

5 considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of past,

6 current, and probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (h)(1), 15130, subd. (a),

7 15355.) A project may have significant effect on the environment if "possible effects of a project are

8 individually limited but cumulatively considerable," meaning "that the incremental effects of an

9 individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the

10 effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (PRC §21083(b)(2).) The

11 definition of "cumulative impacts" is "two or more individual effects which, when considered together,

12 are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts." (14 CCR §15355.)

13 These "individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a number of separate

14 projects." (14 CCR §15355(a).)
15 55. A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project with significant

16 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. These include findings that

17 changes or alterations have been required that mitigate or avoid the project's significant effects on the

18 environment, or that specific considerations render the mitigation measures or alternatives "infeasible"

19 but that the benefits of the project nonetheless outweigh the project's significant environmental effects.
20 The lead agency's findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

21 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091-15093.)

22 56. CEQA requires agencies to consider a "reasonable range of alternatives that will foster
23 informed decision making and public participation." (14 CEQA Guidelines, §15126.6, subd. (a).) The

24 "discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or its location which are capable of
25 avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these alternatives

26 would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly."

27 (CEQA Guidelines, §15126.6, subd. (b).) It is imperative that each alternative allow meaningful
28 evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." (Id. at § 15126.6, subd. (d).) A

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- project cannot be approved if its significant impacts can be feasibly reduced to insignificance through

2 project alternatives or mitigation measures. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21021.) Agencies can

3 eliminate alternatives from detailed consideration in an EIR if they are infeasible, fail to meet "most" of

4 the basic project objectives or do not avoid significant environmental impacts. (CEQA Guidelines,

5 §15126.6, subd. (c).) An agency's rejection of an alternative as "infeasible" or otherwise "unworthy of

6 more in-depth consideration" must be supported by "substantial evidence." (Center for Biological

7 Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 885.)

8 57. If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve
ON the project only if it has "[e]liminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the

10 environment where feasible" and finds that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are

11 "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (14 CCR §15092(b)(2).)

12 58. An abuse of discretion under CEQA may be shown either because an agency failed to
13 proceed in the manner required by law or reached factual conclusions unsupported by substantial
14 evidence. (E.g., Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 935.) A

15 procedural failure is reviewed de novo; in contrast, greater deference is accorded an agency's factual

16 conclusions. (Id.) In any event, "the reviewing court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or
17 analysis presented by a project proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or

18 unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.' (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v.
19 Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 [quoting Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n.12].)
20 There is a prejudicial abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant information precludes
21 informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the

22 EIR process." (Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712 [citing
23 Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 403-05].)

24 59. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

25 discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, regardless of whether:

26 different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those requirements in the
27 first place. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not
28 proceeded in a manner required by law or if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

2 60. Failure to include essential information in the draft EIR constitutes a failure to proceed

3 in the manner required by law. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2

4 Cal.5th 918.)

5 61. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to approving the

6 discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of CEQA
9 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)
10 62. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
11 63. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in a manner
12 required by law by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project
13 based on the inadequate EIR.
14 64. The EIR failed to meet the requirements of CEQA by, inter alia: (a) failing to provide
15 and accurate, stable, and finite project description; (b) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss, and mitigate
16 the impacts on indoor air quality from formaldehyde emissions; (c) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss,
17 and mitigate the impacts on public safety in the event of an evacuation; (d) failing to establish an
18 accurate baseline for impacts to biological resources; (e) failing to establish an accurate baseline for
19 hazardous materials in the soil at the Project site; (f) failing to establish an accurate baseline for impacts
20 to wetlands; (g) failing to disclose the extent of impacts on biological resources, including cumulative
21 impacts; (h) failing to provide substantial evidence that the Project will not have significant impacts on
22 special-status plant species; (i) failing to provide substantial evidence that impacts to special-status
23 species would be less-than-significant after mitigation; (j) failing to analyze the environmental impacts
24 of the Project's mitigation measures; (k) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss, and mitigate the Project's
25 cumulative impacts on wetlands; (I) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss, and mitigate the Project's
26 cumulative flood risks; (m) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss, and mitigate the Project's cumulative
27 impacts in conjunction with existing and reasonably foreseeable future development in the vicinity of
28 the Project; and (n) failing to disclose, analyze, discuss, and mitigate the environmental impacts of the

15

dog park.

2 65. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' adoption of the EIR and associated

3 approvals should be set aside.

4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

6 follows:

7 1. Issue a stay of Respondents' decisions approving the Project pending trial;

2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing:

9 a. Respondents to vacate and set aside the City's February 3, 2020 decision
10 certifying the FEIR and associated Project approvals;
=: b. Respondents and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity on the Project that
12 could result in any change or alternation to the physical environment until

13 Respondents have taken all actions necessary to bring the Project into
14 compliance with CEQA; and

15 C. Respondents to prepare, circulate, and consider a new EIR in compliance with

16 CEQA prior to any subsequent action to approve the Project.

17 3. For an order awarding Petitioner's attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section

18 1021.5, Government Code section 800, and other applicable authority;

19 4. For costs of suit; and

20 5. For such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
