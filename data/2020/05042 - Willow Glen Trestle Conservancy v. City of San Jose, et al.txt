Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner Willow Glen Trestle Conservancy alleges:

Introduction

1.
4 The Willow Glen Trestle Conservancy brings this mandamus action in
the public interest regarding the City of San José's plan to demolish the evocative,

6 century-old Willow Glen Trestle to install a new steel bridge a over Los Gatos Creek.

7 The Trestle is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and its

9 demolition would have significant environmental impact. The Conservancy seeks

10 review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) prior to demolition,

11 to require the City to conduct an environmental impact report (EIR) process to

12 consider and adopt feasible alternatives.
13
2. The City acquired the Trestle property from the Union Pacific Railroad
14

15 Company to serve as part of the pending Three Creeks Pedestrian Trail. The County

16 of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority substantially

17 funded the acquisition of the Trestle property. The City as grantor to the County and

18 the Authority recorded a conservation easement over the Trestle property in
19

20 perpetuity in December 2011, on the same date that the City acquired the property,

21 to preserve, protect, and manage "for the use and enjoyment of all people ... a

22 network of trails that will facilitate public access to outstanding, scenic recreational

23 areas." The easement further recites that its purpose, as codified in the California
24

25 Civil Code, is to "retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical,

26 agricultural, forested, or open-space condition."

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 3. The basis for this mandamus action, inter alia, is the easement's

2 prohibition against alteration of the Trestle site, including via a project involving

3 erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of native vegetation,
4

5 without "written approval" and review and comment by the County and the Open

6 Space Authority. The easement anticipates CEQA review for the Three Creeks Trail

7 at the City's expense.

8 4. The Conservancy's members have been devoted advocates for many
9

10 trails in Santa Clara County. Many are Willow Glen residents and successfully

11 pursued the listing of the Trestle on the California Register and are devoted to its

12 safe and economically feasible adaptive reuse for the Three Creeks Trail.

13 Conservancy members first learned of the existence of the conservation easement in
14

15 late 2019. In December 2019, Conservancy founder Larry Ames notified the City,

16 County, and Authority of the group's awareness of the easement's protective terms

17 and requested notice of compliance. No response has been received to date.

18 5. On June 15, 2020, Dr. Ames visited the Trestle site. The City's lead

19 engineer for the Trestle demolition, Yoshi Yano, was present and informed him that
20

21 the City intends to proceed with demolition on Thursday June 18, 2020.

12 CEQA is a citizen-enforced statute, and the Conservancy urgently seeks

13 a peremptory writ. The City, County, and Authority must comply with the terms of

14 the conservation easement before disturbing the Trestle or native vegetation at the

15 site and must comply with CEQA in doing so. Because demolition would cause
16

17 significant environmental impact, CEQA compliance must take the form of an EIR.

18 Jurisdiction
19

20 7. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

21 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The petitioner, the respondent and real party

22 agencies, and the Trestle itself are located within the County of Santa Clara.
23

24 Parties

25 8. The Willow Glen Conservancy is an unincorporated association formed in
26

27 the public interest in 2018. The Conservancy is devoted to the preservation and

28 I rehabilitation of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy's members include

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the historic and

2 aesthetic qualities of the Willow Glen Trestle. The Conservancy brings this petition on

3 behalf of all others similarly situated too numerous to be named and brought before
4

5 this Court as petitioners.

6 9. Respondent City of San José is the governmental body who is the grantor

7 in the subject conservation easement. The City through the respondent Public Works

8 Department is proceeding with a project to demolish the Trestle without complying
9

10 with the terms of the easement or preparing an EIR.

11 10. Real parties in interest County of Santa Clara and the Santa Clara Valley

12 Open Space Authority aka the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority are

13 governmental bodies and grantees to the subject conservation easement. During the
14

15 course of discovery in this action, if all parties and the Court agree that the County and

16 the Authority are not indispensable parties, the Conservancy may choose to dismiss

17 them from this action. Alternatively, if the County and the Authority are instead

18 determined to be appropriate respondent parties, the Conservancy may amend this
19 petition to correct their status.
20

21 11. Does 1 through 10 are named as respondents and real parties in interest

22 because there are no private applicants who sought and received approval for the

23 Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge Project or for demolition of the Willow Glen

24 Trestle, and true names and capacities are currently unknown. If true names and
25

26 capacities become known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.

27 12. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

28 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

3 General Allegations

4 Willow Glen Trestle

5
13.
6 The Willow Glen Trestle was built by Western Pacific Railroad when it

7 was a rival to the dominant Southern Pacific Railroad. Following World War I, when

8 Western Pacific was cash-strapped and looking for freight income it built the

9 undersized Willow Glen Trestle that forced trains to operate very slowly, under 10
10

11 miles an hour. Its design and construction in 1921 reflected the unique conditions of a

12 time and place: the post-World War I materials' shortage, Western Pacific's economic

13 constraints, and the demand for quick service by new canneries in Willow Glen and

14 across San José.
15
14. For decades, the Southern Pacific (SP) railroad tracks had followed 4th 16

17 Street right through the center of San José. When that railroad's franchise expired at the

18 turn of the twentieth century, the city began pressuring SP to relocate its tracks. The

19 State Railroad Commission recommended that SP loop around the City and share
20 tracks with Western Pacific. However, because of the undersized design of the Trestle,
21

22 this was infeasible. SP built its own crossing of Los Gatos Creek - the bridge near San

23 Carlos Street that is still in use today.

24 15. The Willow Glen Trestle was strong enough only to carry freight for trains
25 that ran "dead slow." This caused traffic congestion and led to the "grade separation"
26

27 movement and the eventual incorporation of the Town of Willow Glen.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 16. It took some years for SP to build its tracks around San José, and in the

2 meantime Western Pacific served the area's many canneries. The route became Western

3 Pacific's "cash cow" and enabled the railroad to become profitable and expand its
4

5 operations. By a the 1930s, Western Pacific had a network of lines traversing the Bay

6 Area eastward across the Sierras, providing an alternative to the SP monopoly.

7 17. If the Willow Glen Trestle had been just a "common trestle," Western

8 Pacific would not have developed a lucrative cannery business, SP's dominance would
9

10 likely have been unchallenged, and the area might have developed very differently.

11 Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge Project
12

13 18. For decades, the members of the Conservancy have volunteered to benefit

14 the Los Gatos Creek Trail and Three Creeks Trail, and as part of that effort worked

15 with City planners to incorporate the Willow Glen Trestle into the trail network.
16 The Conservancy provided information to planners and government officials about the
17

18 Trestle and railroad rights-of way, seeking grants so that the City could acquire them

19 for the Three Creeks Trail and its connection to the Los Gatos Creek Trail.

20 19. In January 2014, the City proposed a mitigated negative declaration for a

21 new Three Creeks Trail Pedestrian Bridge project, including demolition of the City-
22

23 owned Willow Glen Trestle and replacement with a prefabricated single-span steel

24 truss bridge on the same alignment. The City Council approved the project, refusing

25 the Conservancy's requests for preparation of an EIR despite expert evidence of the

26 Trestle's historicity. Two members voted against the mitigated negative declaration
27

28 and against the project, expressing grave concerns about the approval process.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 20. Following project approval, the Friends of the Willow Glen Trestle

2 (Friends) filed a mandamus petition seeking an EIR. Although the petition was initially

3 granted by this Court and a writ issued, the mitigated negative declaration was
4

5 ultimately upheld in case number CIV 489446 following reversal by the Sixth District

6 Court of Appeal in Friends of the Willow Glen Trestle v. City of San José (2017) 2

7 Cal.App.5th 457.

8 21. While the City's appeal was pending, it prepared and certified an EIR
9

10 addressing the demolition of the Trestle in 2014. The EIR analyzed the Trestle and

11 concluded that its rehabilitation for adaptive reuse as part of the trail project was

12 practical, safe, and economically feasible. However, the EIR also concluded that

13 demolition would have no significant environmental impacts since the Trestle was not
14 historic. The Friends did not file a legal challenge because it was not yet ripe; 15

16 challenges to the sufficiency of an EIR must be made after a project is approved in

17 reliance on that CEQA document. The City did not reconsider its approval of the

18 Trestle demolition project following certification of the EIR; it appeared that the reason
19 the City did not do so is that it would have made its appeal moot. 20

21 California Register Listing
22
22.
23 While the legal cases were pending, the Friends successfully nominated

24 the Trestle to the California Register. The Trestle was listed in the Register in 2017 by

25 the California Historical Resources Commission over the City's objections. The City
26 filed and lost a legal challenge in San Francisco Superior Court to set aside the listing.
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 Conservation Easement

2 23. The City acquired the Trestle property from the Union Pacific Railroad
3
Company to serve as part of the pending Three Creeks Pedestrian Trail. The County
4

5 and the Authority substantially funded the acquisition of the Trestle property. The City

6 as grantor to the County and the Authority recorded a conservation easement over the

7 Trestle property in perpetuity in December 2011, on the same day that the City

8 acquired the property, to preserve, protect, and manage "for the use and enjoyment of
9

10 all people ... a network of trails that will facilitate public access to outstanding, scenic

11 recreational areas." The easement further recites that its purpose, as codified in the

12 California Civil Code, is to "retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical,

13 agricultural, forested, or open-space condition."
14
24.
15 The easement prohibits physical alteration of the Trestle site, including via

16 a project involving erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of

17 native vegetation, without "written approval" and review and comment by the County|

18 and the Open Space Authority. The easement anticipates CEQA review for the Three
19

20 Creeks Trail at the City's expense.

21 Legal Proceedings
22

23 25. In 2018, the Conservancy and the Friends filed a CEQA mandamus action

24 against the City relating to its application for and approval of a Streambed Alteration

25 Agreement (SAA) with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The City had
26 approved an SAA in 2014 as required to proceed with the demolition of the Trestle, but
27

28 it expired in 2017. The City did not prepare EIR review as requested by the

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 Conservancy despite the interim listing of the Trestle in the State Register. The import

2 of the change in circumstances is that demolition of the Trestle is now confirmed to

3 have a significant environmental impact. The Conservancy's mandamus petition was
4

5 denied in June 2018, after which the Sixth District Court of Appeal issued a temporary

6 stay of demolition followed by a writ of supersedeas in July 2018. The Court of Appeal
thereafter affirmed the judgment in a published ruling in Willow Glen Trestle

8 Conservancy v. City of San José (2020) _ Cal.App.5th__. The current supersedeas writ
9

10 will expire on June 17, 2020, when the appellate opinion becomes final.

11 26. Despite many requests over many months, the City has not informed the

12 | Conservancy or its counsel whether or not it contends that it has complied with the

13 conservation easement's mandates.

14
27.
15 On Monday, June 15, 2020, Conservancy founder Dr. Larry Ames visited

16 the Trestle site and observed City personnel present, including Yoshi Yano, the lead

17 engineer for the Trestle demolition project, who informed him that the City intended to

18 proceed with demolition on June 17.

19
28. The Conservancy has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
20

21 ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate,

22 severe, and irreparable harm to San José residents and city resources via the demolition

23 of the historic Willow Glen Trestle. The City has the capacity to correct its violations of
24 law but refuses to do so.
25

26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

2 29. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
3
30.
4 The City abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

5 law in failing to date to comply with the mandates of the conservation easement before

6 moving forward with the imminent demolition of the Trestle on the basis of the 2014

7 Mitigated Negative Declaration.
8
31.
9 The conservation easement prohibits physical alteration of the Trestle site,

10 including erection of "new structures or improvements" or disturbance of native

11 vegetation, without "written approval" and review and comment by the County and

12 the Open Space Authority. The City has not obtained review, comment, or approval by
13

14 the County and the Authority for the demolition of the historic Trestle, which would

15 result in a significant environmental impact that has not been studied or mitigated.

16 Due to the significant impact that would attend demolition, an EIR process is required

17 to inform the discretion of the County and the Authority. The conservation easement
18 anticipates CEQA review at the expense of the City.
19

20 Wherefore, petitioner requests:
21
1.
22 That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering respondent

23 City of San José, et al., not to proceed with the Three Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge

24 Project and demolition of the Willow Glen Trestle and to refrain from further

25 consideration until full compliance with CEQA is achieved, including preparation and
26 certification of an adequate EIR and adoption of feasible mitigations and alternatives
27

28 based on findings supported by substantial evidence;

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

1 2. That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and preliminary

2 injunction enjoining the City respondents and their agents and employees from any

3 and all physical actions in furtherance of the Three Creek Trails Pedestrian Bridge
4

5 Project or that would physically alter the site or the Willow Glen Trestle while this

6 petition is pending, including but not limited to grading, demolition, pre-construction,

7 or construction activities of any kind;

8 3. For petitioner's costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5;
C
4.
10 For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
