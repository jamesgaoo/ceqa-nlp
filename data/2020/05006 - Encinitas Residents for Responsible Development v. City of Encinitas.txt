ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of Encinitas ("City" or
3 "Respondent") of City Council Ordinance No. 2019-10, which revised Title 24 of the Encinitas

4 Municipal Code ("Municipal Code") regarding subdivisions, lot consolidations, and lot line

5 adjustments ("Ordinance"), the related determination of exemption under the California Environmental

6 Quality Act ("CEQA"), and the resulting exemption from CEQA review of the Encinitas Boulevard

7 Apartments Project and similarly-situated development projects (collectively "the Actions").

8 2. In May 2019, the City determined proposed housing development, the Encinitas

9 Boulevard Apartments Project, did not qualify as a "by right" project under the City's newly adopted

10 2013-2021 Housing Element Update ("Housing Element"). As a project that did not qualify as "by

11 right," the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project was subject to environmental review under CEQA.

12 3. Encinitas residents and the Olivenhain Town Council raised concerns to the City about the

13 potential environmental impacts of development at the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project site.

14 4. The Building Industry Association of San Diego County ("BIA") subsequently objected to

15 the City's determination that the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project was not a "by right" project.

16 After discussing the issue with BIA, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project applicant, and the

17 State of California Department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD"), the City proposed

18 the Ordinance. The City informed HCD that, if adopted, the Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas

19 Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated projects from environmental review under

20 CEQA.

21 5. Despite the Ordinance's genesis as a response to review of the Encinitas Boulevard

22 Apartments Project and related pressure by BIA, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project

23 applicant, and HCD, the City's public notice for the Ordinance failed to inform the public of the

24 Ordinance's impacts on the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project or similarly-situated projects. In

25 addition, City staff reports and presentations for the Ordinance failed to discuss the Encinitas

26 Boulevard Apartments Project or similarly-situated projects.

27 6. The City's use of a CEQA exemption to approve the Ordinance and the inadequate notice

28 precluded public participation during the approval of the Ordinance, and will preclude public

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page
Writ Petition

1 participation during future review and approval of the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and

2 other similarly-situated projects As a result of the Actions, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments

3 Project now proposes a 283 residential unit development on less than seven acres in the rural

4 Olivenhain community where typical density is one to two homes per acre.

5 7. The approval of the Ordinance was the result of a coordinated effort by the City, HCD,

6 BIA, and proponents of the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project to evade environmental review of

7 and public participation regarding the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project. The Ordinance will

8 exempt the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated projects from CEQA

9 | review.

10 8. The City violated CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among

11 other things, the City failed to provide adequate notice, failed to adequately consider the environmental

12 impacts associated with the Actions, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis,
13 failed to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation, and improperly piecemealed environmental

14 review of the Project and its direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts.

15 9. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

16 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

17 PARTIES

18 10. Petitioner Encinitas Residents of Responsible Development ("Petitioner") is an

19 unincorporated association of residents and property owners within the City of Encinitas who seek to

20 maintain the quality of life in Encinitas, including promoting responsible development, ensuring the

21 environmental and economic impacts of large-scale, intensive development are properly studied and

22 addressed, and minimizing the adverse effects of development on the community. Petitioner and its

23 members have been injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy and

24 benefit from the resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the

25 recreational, vocational, aesthetic, scientific, environmental and economic interests of Petitioner and of

26 Petitioner's members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to

27 be adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress

28 Petitioner's and Petitioner's members' injuries.

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 3
Writ Petition

1 11. Respondent City of Encinitas ("City" or "Respondent") is a political subdivision of the State

2 of California and the County of San Diego and a body corporate and politic exercising local government

3 powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

4 12. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

5 Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

6 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

7 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

8 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

9 13. In March 2019, Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project proponents began coordinating the

10 review and processing of the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project with Respondent.

11 14. The Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project site is located at 2220 Encinitas Boulevard,

12 2228 Encinitas Boulevard, 2230 Encinitas Boulevard, and a vacant parcel on Rancho Santa Fe Road in

13 the Community of Olivenhain in the City of Encinitas. The Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project is

14 subject to the City's General Plan Land Use Designation R-30 and is on land zoned RR-2 (residential

15 rural at two dwelling units per acre) with a R-30 overlay zone (30 dwelling units per acre).

16 15. The Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project requires a lot consolidation of the site's lots to

17 make one single lot. When originally proposed, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project's lot

18 consolidation was considered a subdivision under the Municipal Code and was subject to CEQA

19 review.

20 16. The Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project also requires Design Review approval.

21 17. The Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project proposes to construct a housing development

22 with 283 residential units.

23 18. On March 13, 2019, Respondent approved the 2013-2021 Housing Element Update

24 ("Housing Element") and related Environmental Assessment, implementing the Housing Element in

25 order to update the City's General Plan.

26 19. On March 27, 2019, Respondent adopted City Council Ordinance No. 2019-04

27 implementing the Housing Element.

28

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 4
Writ Petition

1 20. The Housing Element's Environmental Assessment discussed two categories of future

2 development contemplated for projects on R-30 sites. It provides: "Future development on R-30 sites

3 that includes 20 percent lower income housing and no subdivision must be approved 'by right' as

4 defined in GOV § 65583.2(h). These developments would be exempt from CEQA and may not be

5 subject to further discretionary review, but may be subject to design review pursuant to [Encinitas

6 Municipal Code] Chapter 23.08, Design Review; see also Section 1.3.3 and Design Review discussion

7 below. These developments would also be required to conform with all mitigation measures adopted as

8 part of this EA. Future development on R-30 sites that does not qualify as a 'use by right' would be

9 subject to further discretionary review or approval by the City, including environmental review under

10 CEQA."

11 21. The Environmental Assessment's discussion of requirements for development on the newly

12 up-zoned R-30 sites provided that, under the Housing Element, intensive residential development that

13 require a subdivision would not qualify as a "by right" use, and would be subject to environmental

14 review for potential impacts under CEQA. When the Housing Element was adopted in March 2019,

15 because the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project required a subdivision it did not qualify as a "by

16 right" use and was subject to review under CEQA.

17 22. At the time the Housing Element was adopted, a lot consolidation that resulted in the

18 creation of one single lot constituted a subdivision and required a Parcel Map Waiver pursuant to

19 Encinitas Municipal Code ("Municipal Code") Title 24 and Chapter 24.60. Because of this, the

20 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project was subject to environmental review under CEQA.

21 23. At the time the Housing Element was adopted, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project

22 did not qualify as a "use by right" and was subject to further discretionary review by Respondent,

23 including review under CEQA as provided by the Housing Element.

24 24. On May 29, 2019, following adoption of the Housing Element, Encinitas Boulevard

25 Apartments Project proponents had a Staff Advisory Committee meeting with City staff. At the

26 meeting, Respondent informed the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project proponents that the

27 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project was not a "by right" use under the Housing Element because

28 it required a subdivision to consolidate its lots. Accordingly, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments

ERRD v. City of Encinitas
Writ Petition Page

1 Project would require a Design Review and Parcel Map Waiver, and the Parcel Map Waiver would

2 have to comply with CEQA.

3 25. On July 8, 2019, the Building Industry Association of San Diego County ("BIA") submitted

4 a letter to the City contesting its determination that the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project would

5 be required to apply for a Parcel Map Waiver and to comply with CEQA pursuant to the Municipal

6 Code. The letter took issue with Respondent's determination that the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments

7 Project was not a "by right" project and alleged that such a determination was contradictory to the

8 Housing Element. Alluding to previous lawsuits filed against Respondent, the letter disagreed with the

9 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project's required environmental review under CEQA to obtain a

10 Parcel Map Waiver and claimed that such requirement violated the Housing Element. The Encinitas

11 Boulevard Apartments Project's attorney and HCD staff were copied on the letter.

12 26. On July 10, 2019, Respondent and HCD staff discussed the issues raised by the letter in a

13 telephone conversation.

14 27. On July 17, 2019, HCD staff sent an email to Respondent regarding the same issues.

15 28. In response to the letter, and subsequent correspondence with HCD, Respondent sent a letter

16 dated July 19, 2019 to HCD. The July 19, 2019 letter explained that the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments

17 Project's proposed lot consolidation required a Parcel Map Waiver, which is a subdivision, and was

18 subject to the related requirements under the Subdivision Map Act, Municipal Code Title 24, and CEQA.

19 The letter also stated that Respondent was now developing an amendment the City's Subdivision

20 Ordinance. The letter explained that the amendment to the City's Subdivision Ordinance would exempt

21 the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated projects from environmental review

22 under CEQA. Attached to Respondent's letter to HCD were: (1) a redline version of the proposed

23 amendments to Municipal Code Title 24; and (2) a copy of the minutes from the May 29, 2019 Staff

24 Advisory Committee meeting regarding the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project.

25 29. Under the proposed amendments discussed by Respondent, the Encinitas Boulevard

26 Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects would only require a lot-line adjustment and

27 Design Review, effectively precluding any environmental review under CEQA for such projects.

28 //

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 6
Writ Petition

1 30. The proposed amendments discussed by Respondent in its letter to HCD contradicted the

2 Housing Element's Environmental Assessment provision that future development such as the Encinitas

3 Boulevard Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects that do not qualify as "by right"

4 uses would be subject to CEQA review.

5 31. On August 15, 2019 the Encinitas Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") met to

6 consider City Council Ordinance No. 2019-10 ("Ordinance"), which proposed the changes to

7 Municipal Code Title 24 discussed by Respondent in its letter to HCD concerning the Encinitas

8 Boulevard Apartments Project.

9 32. The City issued a notice on July 26, 2019 regarding the Ordinance, which claimed the

10 Ordinance was exempt from environmental review under CEQA. The notice did not mention the

11 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project or any other similarly-situated projects that would be affected

12 by the Ordinance. The notice did not explain that with its adoption the Ordinance would exempt the

13 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects from CEQA review.

14 33. The staff report for the August 15, 2019 Planning Commission meeting claimed the

15 Ordinance was exempt from environmental review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15378(b)(5)

16 because the Ordinance would "not result in direct or indirect physical changes in the environment."

17 The staff report claimed: "The proposed ordinance update, which is citywide, involves changes and

18 modifications to existing code that are not associated with, or do not directly impact a private or public
19 development/construction project." The staff report failed to mention the Encinitas Boulevard

20 Apartments Project or any other similarly-situated projects that would be affected by the Ordinance.

21 The staff report did not explain that, if adopted, the Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard

22 Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects from CEQA review.

23 34. At the August 15, 2019 Planning Commission meeting, City staff explained that the

24 Ordinance would change the requirements for "lot consolidations" to move it from Municipal Code

25 Chapter 24.60 governing subdivisions to Chapter 24.70 governing lot-line adjustments. At the

26 meeting, staff did not mention the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project or any other similarly-

27 situated projects that would be affected by the Ordinance. Staff did not explain that, if adopted, the

28 Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and other similarly-situated

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page
Writ Petition

1 projects from CEQA review. Despite its letter to HCD that stated the Ordinance would exempt the

2 Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated projects from CEQA, staff incorrectly

3 represented to the Planning Commission that following adoption of the proposed amendments: "Any

4 projects that would come forward with lot-line adjustments would be reviewed against CEQA."

5 35. At the August 15, 2019 meeting, the Planning Commission voted to recommend the City

6 Council adopt the Ordinance.

7 36. At the August 28, 2019 City Council meeting, the Ordinance was introduced for a first

8 reading. The staff report for the August 28, 2019 City Council meeting claimed the Ordinance was

9 exempt from environmental review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15378(b)(5) because the

10 Ordinance would "not result in direct or indirect physical changes in the environment." The staff

11 report claimed: "The proposed ordinance update, which is citywide, involves changes and

12 modifications to existing code that are not associated with, or do not directly impact a private or public

13 development/construction project." The staff report failed to mention the Encinitas Boulevard

14 Apartments Project or any other similarly-situated projects that would be affected by the Ordinance.

15 The staff report did not explain that, if adopted, the Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard

16 Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects from CEQA review.

17 37. During August 28, 2019 City Council meeting, staff failed to mention the Encinitas

18 Boulevard Apartments Project or any other similarly-situated projects that would be affected by the

19 Ordinance. Staff did not explain that, if adopted, the Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard

20 Apartments Project and other similarly-situated projects from CEQA review.

21 38. The Ordinance was heard at the September 11, 2019 City Council meeting for its second

22 reading and vote as part of the consent calendar. The staff report for the September 11, 2019 City

23 Council meeting included identical claims from the previous two staff reports regarding the Project's

24 supposed exempt status under CEQA. The staff report for the September 11, 2019 City Council

25 meeting failed to mention the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project or any other similarly-situated

26 projects that would be affected by the Ordinance. The staff report did not explain that, if adopted, the

27 Ordinance would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and other similarly-situated

28 projects from CEQA review.

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 8
Writ Petition

39. At the September 11, 2019 meeting, City Council voted to approve the Ordinance.

2 40. Following the City's initial determination that the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project

3 did not qualify as a "by right" project, the City engaged in a coordinated effort with HCD, BIA, and

1 proponents of the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project to adopt the Ordinance amending the

5 Municipal Code to now qualify the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated

6 projects as "by right" uses. As a result, the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-

7 situated projects would be exempt from environmental review under CEQA. At no point during the

8 public decision process did the City mention the Ordinance's impact on the Encinitas Boulevard

9 Apartments Project or other similarly-situated projects.

10 41. The City filed a Notice of Exemption regarding the Ordinance on January 27, 2020.

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

13 42. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Actions

14 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

15 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

16 hearings.

17 43. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

18 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

19 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

20 44. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

21 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Actions, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
22 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

23 45. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

24 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

25 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

26 46. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

27 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Actions and the CEQA Exemption

28 Determination. In the absence of such remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation

ERRD v. City of Encinitas
Writ Petition Page

1 of State law, and Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse

2 environmental impacts generated by the Actions.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CEQA PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS)

5 47. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

6 forth herein in full.

7 48. The City improperly considered the Ordinance exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA,

8 inconsistent with, among other things, CEQA Guidelines Sections 15060(c)(2), 15062(c)(3) and

9 15378(b)(5).

10 49. Among the reasons the Ordinance is not exempt are the following: (a) the Ordinance will

11 result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment; and (b) the

12 Ordinance is an activity that will result in direct or indirect physical changes in the environment.

13 50. Respondent was aware of concerns regarding the environmental impacts of the Encinitas

14 Boulevard Apartments Project and similarly-situated development proposals when it approved the

15 Ordinance. Respondent knew that the Actions would exempt the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments

16 Project and similarly-situated projects from environmental review under CEQA. The "use by right"

17 approval of the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project and other similarly-situated development

18 proposals will result in unstudied and unmitigated environmental impacts because of the removal of

19 any discretionary approval by Respondent for such foreseeable future developments proposal. Thus,

20 the Actions will result in direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the

21 environment due to developments, including the Encinitas Boulevard Apartments Project.

22 51. Even if the Ordinance were properly subject to an exemption, exceptions to that exemption

23 apply pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, including significant effects due to unusual
24  circumstances and significant cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same types in the same

25 place.

26 52. The City violated CEQA by improperly determining the Actions exempt.

27 53. The City failed to prepare an Initial Study to determine what environmental analysis was

28 necessary, as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15063.

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 10
Writ Petition

1 54. Respondent failed to follow procedures mandated by CEQA, including but not limited to,

2 failing to provide proper notice for public involvement, failing to notify responsible agencies, failing to

3 allow adequate opportunity for public input, and failing to provide adequate access to documents

4 related to the Actions.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (FAILURE TO CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE ACTIONS AND RELATED
ACTIVITIES)

7 55. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

8 forth herein in full.

9 56. The City failed to consider all aspects of the Actions, the Ordinance, the Encinitas Boulevard

10 Apartments Project, and related activities.

11 57. The City failed to consider future development that foreseeably will occur as a result of

12 Ordinance approval.

13 58. The City improperly segmented the Actions, piecemealing or otherwise avoiding reasonably

14 foreseeable impacts, and separately focusing on isolated parts of the whole.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (FAILURE TO PREPARE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS REQUIRED BY CEQA)

17 59. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

18 forth herein in full.

19 60. The City failed to prepare environmental analysis consistent with CEQA, including Public

20 Resources Code Section 21084(a) and CEQA Guidelines Section 15063.

21 61. Even if the Ordinance were properly subject to an exemption, exceptions to that exemption

22 apply pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, including significant effects due to unusual

23 circumstances and significant cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same types in the same

24 place.

25 62. The City failed to consider feasible alternatives, including but not limited to, alternatives

26 requiring less impacts that meet some or all of the Actions objectives.

27 //

28 //

ERRD v. City of Encinitas Page 11
Writ Petition

1 63. The City failed to consider feasible mitigation measures, failed to mitigate for each

2 environmental effect, illegally deferred mitigation, and failed to provide for effective and enforceable

3 mitigation.

4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

6 A. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction

7 enjoining Respondents from taking any steps to further the Actions until lawful approval is obtained from

8 Respondents after the preparation and consideration of adequate environmental analysis, with adequate

9 notice to interested parties, adoption of findings supported by substantial evidence, and compliance with
10 applicable requirements;

11 B. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, vacating approval of all aspects of the

12 Actions, and enjoining Respondents from taking any steps to further the Actions until lawful approval is

13 obtained from Respondents after the preparation and consideration of adequate environmental analysis,

14 with adequate notice to interested parties, adoption of findings supported by substantial evidence, and

15 compliance with applicable requirements;

16 C. For costs of suit;

17 D. For reasonable attorneys' fees; and

18 E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
