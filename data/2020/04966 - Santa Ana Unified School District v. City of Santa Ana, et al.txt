VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

* 14.

2 District has a direct and beneficial interest in the Project in that the Project's

3 environmental impacts have not been studied by the City and based on the District's expert's traffic

4 impact report, the Project will significantly impact the District's school site, students, staff, and
community members.

5 15.

6 This action has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action under

7 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code § 21167.

O0 16. BACKGROUND

9 Vista Heritage School is located in Santa Ana, California in the Civic Center Business

HENDERSON LLP 10 Park. The Civic Center Business Park is located on the corner of Fairview Street and 5th Street and

11 was originally zoned Light Industrial (M-1). In 2008, the City Council approved a zoning ordinance

12 amendment for the business park to Specific Development Zone 82 ("SD82").

17.

13 The 2008 zoning ordinance amendment was initiated by the Templo Calvario

% 14

ORBACH ZaXVOs dAOH Assembly of God Church, which was proposing to expand its church facilities by constructing a larger

15 facility in the business park. However, the original intention of the business park, light industrial uses,

16 never changed, With the exception of the church and charter school, the uses are light industrial,

18.

17 The establishment of the SD82 zoning district permitted schools that are affiliated with

18 churches, with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP").

19.

19 A CUP is a discretionary act under the California Environmental Quality Act

20 ("CEQA"), which requires environmental review prior to approval. (City Municipal Code, § 41-668;

21 Public Resources Code, § 21080(a).)

20.

22 In Or around 2018, however, Red Hook Capital Partners III, LLC (*Applicant*)

23 representing Vista Heritage School, submitted to City an application for Zoning Ordinance

24 Amendment No. 2019-01 ("Zoning Ordinance Amendment") "to amend the permitted uses and

25 Operational Standards sections of the [SD82] zoning district to specify 'schools' as a permitted use in

26 conjunction with operational standards" for the purpose of "permit[ting] the expansion of an existing

27 school at 2601-2617 West Fifh Street" ("Project").

21.

28 The City's Planning Commission considered and recommended approval of the Project
to the City Council on February 11, 2019, and the City Council considered the Project on March 19,

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2019, May 7, 2019, and December 17, 2019, and considered and illegally approved the Project on

2 January 21, 2020, and City published staff reports (*Staff Reports") for each of these meetings.

22. The Staff Reports stated, "The purpose of the Zoning Ordinance Amendment... request

4 is to permit the expansion of an existing school at 2601-2617 West Fifth Street," which is the Vista
Heritage School.

6 23. Although City properly included the expansion of Vista Heritage School as part of the

7 Project in its Staff Reports, as for environmental, it sought to separate the Zoning Ordinance

8 Amendment from the expansion of the school, which is a violation of CEQA by not considering the

9 Project as the whole of the action, which is the Zoning Ordinance Amendment and the Vista Heritage
HENDERSON LLP 10 School expansion.

11 24. In the Staff Reports, not only did City state that the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance

12 Amendment is to expand Vista Heritage School, it also included details on the expansion within the

13 "project description."

14 25.
8 The effect of this Zoning Ordinance Amendment is to allow Vista Heritage School as
ZEXYNS dAOH HOVANO 15 a "permitted" use in the SD82 zoning district, and therefore to allow Vista Heritage School to expand

16 its operations from 18,368 square feet to 66,000 square feet and from 270 students to 870 students,

17 without any environmental review,

18 26. Without this Zoning Ordinance Amendment, a CUP is required for the initiation and

19 expansion of school uses in the SD82 zoning district and would require CEQA review.

20 27. However, the Staff Reports stated that the Project is exempt from CEQA, per CEQA

21 Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) (Cal. Code of Regs, tit. 14, §§ 15000-15387 ("CEQA Guidelines")),

22 commonly known as the "Common Sense Exemption". On February 11, 2019, the City's Planning

23 Commission held a public hearing on the proposed Project and area residents commented and objected

24 to the Project.

25 28. After receiving the public testimony, the Planning Commission recommended that the

26 City Council approve the Project.

27 29. On February 21, 2019, District submitted a comment letter to City objecting to the

28 Project based on parking, traffic, and traffic circulation concerns.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

30. Per the City's Municipal Code, after recommendation of the Zoning Ordinance

2 Amendment by the Planning Commission, the is City Council is required to hold a hearing on it. (City

3 Municipal Code, § 41-667.)

31. The Project was placed on the March 19, 2019 City Council agenda, but it was taken

5 off the agenda during the meeting, for continuance at a future meeting date.

6 32. In advance of the City Council's consideration of the Project, on March 19, 2019,

7 District submitted a comment letter objecting to the City Council's approval of the Project based on

8 concerns with parking, safety, and traffic circulation that would be caused by the Project.

9 33. On May 7, 2019, the Project was again considered by the City Council, a public hearing

HENDERSON LLP ZANYOS HOH HOFANO 10 was held, and again the City Council's Staff Report stated that the Project is exempt from CEQA under

11 the Common Sense Exemption.

12 34. At the May 7, 2019 public hearing, District specifically voiced concerns about the

13 traffic and safety impacts from the Project and concerns that the Project had not undergone any

14 environmental review. Members of the public and City Council Members also voiced concerns about ed
15 the lack of environmental review and potential parking, circulation, and traffic impacts resulting from

16 the Project.

17 35. City Council members acknowledged that there could be traffic impacts but minimized

18 these concerns by mentioning traffic congestion at District school sites and stating traffic is an issue

19 we all have to live with.

20 36. Minh Thai, the Executive Director of the City's Planning and Building Agency

21 ("Planning Director"), stated that the Project is exempt because the Project is a change of land use and

22 there is no physical change in terms of physical development and the only possible change that could

23 take place is to traffic.

24 37, Further, the City's Planning Director stated that a traffic study had been conducted

25 based on CEQA thresholds and local city thresholds and that based on the traffic study, there would

26 be no impacts. Later on in the public hearing, the Planning Director contradicted himself stating that

27 there would be a change in the level of service at one intersection, but the impact would not be

28 significant. The traffic study was not disclosed, reviewed, or scrutinized by the public.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

* 38.

2 Finally, staff mentioned certain measures were implemented to mitigate traffic and

3 circulation impacts and a City Council member asked why is there mitigation if there are no impacts?

4 Staff's response was that these are not mitigation measures, but operational conditions. The City
Council voted three to three, which means no action taken.

5 39.

6 Due to the District's traffic and traffic safely concerns, it commissioned its own
"Traffic Impact Report" dated September 5, 2019 and prepared by the well-known traffic expert, IBI.

8 On October 25, 2019, District transmitted the Traffic Impact Report by cover letter to City objecting

9 to the Project due to the traffic, circulation, and traffic safety concerns outlined in the Traffic Impact

Report.

HENDERSON LLP 10 40.

11 The District further implored City to conduct environmental analysis of the Project
prior to reconsidering it at a future City Council meeting.

12 41.

13 On December 17, 2019, the City Council held another public hearing on the Project.

14 The City Council's Staff Report still stated that the Project is exempt from CEQA review under the

8
ORBACH HUFF SUAREZ Common Sense Exemption, and therefore no environmental review was conducted.

15

16 a. In advance of the public hearing, District hand delivered another opposition letter

17 objecting to the Project due to the lack of environmental review, traffic, circulation,
and traffic safety impacts.

18

19 b. At the hearing, District's counsel, Stan Barankiewicz, the District's Assistant

- 20 Superintendent, Orin Williams, and the District's Director of Facilities Planning,

21 Jeremy D. Cogan, AICP pointed out that the Project is not exempt from CEQA,

22 requested environmental review, and provided evidence that the Project would cause
significant traffic and safety impacts.

23 C.

24 During the public hearing, other area residents and business owners also objected to

25 the Project based on traffic, circulation, parking, and safety concerns.

26 d. Also, during the public hearing, one City Council member acknowledged that the
Project would cause impacts.

27

28 e. Subsequent to close of the public hearing, the City Council approved the first reading
of the Zoning Ordinance Amendment.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

42. On January 21, 2020, the Project was placed on the City Council's Consent Agenda for

2 final approval, and the District's Director of Facilities Planning, Jeremy D. Cogan, AICP reiterated

3 the District's concerns from the December 17, 2019 meeting. Subsequently, the City Council found

4 the Project to be exempt from CEQA and illegally approved the Project.

5 43. As discussed above, the District exhausted its administrative remedies.

6 44. This action has been brought within 35 days of City's filing of the Notice of Exemption,

7 which was filed on January 22, 2020.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (For Peremptory Writ of Mandate per Code Civ. Proc. §8 1085 and 1094.5 to Vacate

10 Approvals of the Project) HENDERSON LLP ZaMVAS ddNH HOY8XO 11 [As Against City and ROES 1 through 200]

12 45. District realleges and incorporates by reference each paragraph above, as though fully
13 set forth herein.
14 CITY'S DETERMINATION THAT THE PROJECT WAS EXEMPT FROM CEQA WAS
d
15 NOT SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

16 46. CEQA and a the CEQA Guidelines establish a three-tier process to ensure that public

17 agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.

18 47. First, a public agency must review an application for the activity to determine whether

19 the activity is a "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.)

20 48. CEQA Guidelines § 15378 defines a "project" as the whole of an action, which has a

21 potential for resulting in either: direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable

22 indirect physical change in the environment. An activity that is not a "project" is not subject to CEQA.
23 49. If the activity in question is a project, a public agency can make a determination as to
24 whether the project is exempt from CEQA. A public agency may only exempt a project from CEQA
25 if it is exempt by statute, categorically exempt, but not barred by one of the exceptions, or if the activity

26 in question is covered by the "Common Sense Exemption." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061.)

27 /11

28 /11

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 50. An activity is only covered by the "Common Sense Exemption" if it can be scen with

2 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the

3 environment. (Id.)

4 51. A lead agency invoking the Common Sense Exemption has the burden of
demonstrating it applies. (Muzzy Ranch Co y. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.
6 4th 372, 386, citing, Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal, App.4th 106, 114.) "An
agency's duty to provide such factual support is all the more important where the record shows.that

8 opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts."

9 (Ibid.)

HENDERSON LLP 10 52. The standard of review is whether the City abused its discretion by failing to proceed

11 in a manner required by law or by making a decision that is not supported by substantial evidence.

12 53. City is the lead agency within the meaning of CEQA and the Project is the Zoning

13 Ordinance Amendment, which includes the expansion of Vista Heritage School. The application for

14 the zoning ordinance amendment and expansion of Vista Heritage School are a "project" under CEQA cd
ZaNVAS dAOH HOYAdO 15 because the decision to amend an ordinance is a discretionary action.

16 54, The City Council's December 17, 2019 Staff Report included within its "project

17 description" details on the expansion of Vista Heritage School, and the January 21, 2020 Staff Report

18 stated that the "action will allow the Vista Heritage School to enlarge their existing campus." Thus,

19
8 the Project includes the expansion of Vista Heritage School. The expansion of Vista Heritage School

20 from 270 students to 870 students will result in direct physical changes to the environment, including,

21 but not limited to, additional traffic due to additional students arriving to and from the site.

22 55. City incorrectly determined that the Project qualified for the Common Sense

23 Exemption based on its determination that its CEQA review only goes to the act of approving the

24 Zoning Ordinance Amendment and does not extend further to the effects of the Zoning Ordinance

25 Amendment, which includes the expansion of Vista Heritage School.

26 56, In Rominger v. County of Colusa (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 690, 704, the court held that

27 the Common Sense Exemption could not be applied to the approval of a subdivision map, which by

28 definition anticipates some future development, and that the county also made no showing that there

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

was no possibility of development and resulting environmental impacts.

2 57. Similarly here, the Project is not covered by the Common Sense Exemption because

3 the Zoning Ordinance Amendment will result in the expansion of Vista Heritage School, will in fact

4 affect the environment, and will cause significant environmental impacts, discussed in detail below,

5 and those significant impacts were disclosed to City,

6 58. Further, City's determination that the Project was covered by the Common Sense

7 exemption was not supported by substantial evidence. Several area residents and District commented,

8 and District provided an expert report to support its claim that the Project would cause significant

9 environmental impacts, but City ignored the evidence provided by District and others. City Council

HENDERSON LLP 10 members and even staff acknowledged that there could be traftic impacts from the Project.

11 59. The Common Sense Exemption is applicable when it can be seen with certainty that

12 there is no possibility that the Project may have a significant impact on the environment. But, by

13 conducting a traffic study, City recognized that there may be a possibility of a significant

14
sd environmental impact, which negates use of the Common Sense Exemption.
ZENVAS AANH HOVINO 15 60. Thus, City violated CEQA by incorrectly determining that the Project is exempt from

16 CEQA and its determination that there is no possibility that the Project may have a significant impact

.17 on the environment.

18 CITY VIOLATED CEQA BY NOT CONDUCTING AN INITIAL STUDY LEADING TO A

19 NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT.

20 61. City violated CEQA by failing to act in accordance with the law and committing a

21 prejudicial abuse of discretion by considering and approving the Project without undertaking any

22 analysis of the environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

23 62. Since the Project is not exempt from CEQA, City was required to conduct an initial

24 study to determine if the Project would have a significant impact on the environment. (CEQA

25 Guidelines, § 15063.)

26 63. Further, CEQA requires the lead agency to fully evaluate potential environmental
27 impacts of the Project in a single environmental review document so that "environmental

28 considerations not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones each with a

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

potential impact on the environment, which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences."
2 | (Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592; CEQA

3 Guidelines, § 15003(h).)

4 64. City stated at its May 7, 2019 City Council meeting that it conducted a traffic study and

5 studied 11 intersections near the Project. However, this study should have been included as part of an

6 environmental document studying all of the impacts on the Project and released to the public for review

7 and scrutiny.

8 65. Further, since the City had knowledge of potential significant environmental impacts

9 caused by the Project, it should not have conducted a stand-alone traffic study. The traffic study

HENDERSON LLP 10 should have been conducted under an initial study leading to either a Negative Declaration or

11 Environmental Impact Report.

12 66. Moreover, City must have found some impacts because it required the Applicant to

13 later submit a "Traffic Plan and Safety Plan" as a condition of approval. This constitutes illegal

14
d piecemealing, and this denied decisionmakers and the public the opportunity to fully understand and
ZANVOS 3JOH HOVANO 15 consider the environmental consequences of the Project.

16 CITY VIOLATED CEQA BY FAILING TO MITIGATE SIGNIFICANT

17 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT WILL BE CAUSED BY THE PROJECT.

18 67. The Traffic Impact Report unequivocally identified specific significant traffic,

19 circulation, and safety impacts that would result from the Project.

20 68. The Traffic Impact Report studied ten area intersections using the level of service

21 analysis ("LOS") to evaluate the addition of Project traffic to the existing intersection operating

22 conditions during the weekday AM and PM peak hours.
8 3 69. Based on the results of the LOS analysis, the Project would trigger significant impacts
at four of the ten study area intersections under "Existing with Project Conditions" and five of the ten
25 study area intersections under "Opening Year with Project Conditions." The Project would also trigger

26 both Project-level and cumulative-level Vehicle Miles Travelled (*VMT') impacts per the City of

27 Santa Ana Draft CEQA Assessment - VMT Guidelines.

28 /11

-w 70. The Traffic Impact Report also reported that there are inadequate site distances for

2 vehicles exiting the Project via the 5th Street driveways and Fairview Street. Per the Traffic Impact

3 Report, the Highway Design Manual (*Manual") sets forth the minimum sight distance necessary for

4 vehicles exiting driveways. (Traffic Impact Report, p. 34.) As such, "the [MJanual states that there

5 needs to be areas with clear sight lines (i.e. areas to be free of any obstructions) so that vehicles can

6 enter the traffic stream safely." (Id.) Table 201.1 of the Manual states that for streets with a 35-mph a

7 speed limit (i.e. Fairview Street and 5th Street), a minimum of 250 feet is required for any vehicle

8 travelling on either street to stop in time for vehicles exiting the project driveways. (Id.) The analysis

9 indicates that to obtain the 250 feet required, an area approximately 10 feet back of the curb for a

HENDERSON LLP 10 distance of 120 feet from the driveway be relatively free of obstructions (walls, landscaping, on-street

11 parking). (Id.) As shown in Figure 9 of the Traffic Impact Report, the Project's current sight distances

12 are not adequate and therefore significant safety impacts are anticipated at the following locations:

13 a. Westbound vehicles on 5th Street approaching the Vista Charter Schools Driveway

14 (Intersection 9)
ZaNYASdINH HOVAXO 15 On-Street parking and tree overhang on the north side of 5th Street blocks necessary

16 sight line

17 b. Eastbound vehicles on 5th Street approaching the intersection with Sullivan

19 • On-Street parking and tree overhang on the north side of 5th Street blocks necessary 5 808830 sight line

C. Westbound vehicles on 5th Street approaching the intersection with Sullivan
(Intersection 5)
On-Street parking and tree overhang on the north side of 5th Street blocks necessary
sight line
d. Northbound vehicles on Fairview Street approaching the Vista Heritage Schools

28 line. (Id.)

71. The Traffic Impact Report further found that onsite vehicle queuing would lead to

2 additional significant impacts to accessibility to onsite parking stalls and internal circulation between

3 adjacent businesses within the site. It furthermore found that these very significant impacts in the
4 industrial zone where heavy duty vehicles, equipment, and machinery operate could very well create

5 significant safety concerns for student pedestrians as they navigate through the on-site congestion.

6 72. The Traffic Impact Report stated that Vista Heritage School would need to identify

7 appropriate mitigation measures for the significant impacts to intersections, driveways, VMT, and

8 queuing (both off-site and on-site) under Existing and Opening Year Conditions prior to the proposed

9 school expansion. At a minimum, mitigation measures needed to be determined in order to return

HENDERSON LLP 10 levels of service at the study area intersections and driveways to the pre-Project levels of service or

11 better.

12 73. Finally, the Traffic Impact Report stated that appropriate measures or Project design

13 features to resolve the existing sight distance safety issues for vehicles exiting the Project site at the

14
e8 5th Street driveways and at Fairview Street would need to be developed and implemented.
ZENVOS HUFF HOYENO 15 Furthermore, analysis of the internal circulation patterns of the Project site show that excessive

16 queuing into and out of the Project site would cause blockages to parking stalls as well as interfering

17 with internal access between buildings. Mitigation measures also needed to be developed to reduce

18 the VMT to 15 percent below the countywide average to avoid a significant traffic impact.

19 74.
E City was provided with the Traffic Impact Report and chose not to study or mitigate
20 the significant impacts identified, which was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and violation of CEQA.

21 75. District has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, other

22 than the relief sought in this Petition, in that City and ROES 1 through 200's lack of environmental

23 review and approval of the Project are not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides District

24 with an adequate remedy at law,

25 76. District has exhausted all available and non-futile administrative remedies required to

26 be pursued by it under the law.

27 77. a Without a peremptory writ of mandate, City and ROES 1 through 200, and each of

28 them, will continue to disregard their duties and continue to violate CEQA by refusing to conduct

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS; INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

CEQA review of the Project before implementing the Project. Issuance of a writ is therefore necessary

2 to prevent the continued disregard of City and ROES 1 through 1 200's duties that have harmed the

3 District and the public at large.

5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

6 WHEREFORE, District prays for judgment against Respondent, and each of them, as follows:

7 1. a For a writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5

8 and/or 1085 compelling City to:

9 a. To vacate its determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA.

HENDERSON LLP 10 b. To vacate its approval of the Project.

11 2. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting any actions

12 by City or real parties in interest from commencing the Project during the pendency of

13 this action.

14 3. For District's costs of suit.
&8
ZUMYOS AUOH HOVANO 15 4. For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1021.5 and 1032,

16 Government Code § 800, and/or other applicable law.

17 5. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
