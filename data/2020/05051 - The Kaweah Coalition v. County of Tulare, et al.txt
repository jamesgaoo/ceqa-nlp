COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

H INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 This action challenges the County of Tulare's ("County's") failure to comply with

4 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving a large commercial wedding

5 venue in a remote, high fire area of the County's South Fork Canyon ("Redwood Ranch Project"
or "Project") without any environmental review.

6 2.

7 The Project would import hundreds of people into an area of extreme fire hazards

8 coupled with severely substandard access roads. The Project also intrudes on the quiet bucolic
nature of the surrounding community in South Fork Canyon.

9 3.

10 The County improperly approved the Redwood Ranch Project based upon a Class

11 categorical exemption to CEQA review. Class categorical exemptions are only available for

12 projects that involve negligible or no expansion of use. This exemption is unavailable for the
Project because the Project involves wholly new use.

13 4.

14 Due to the impactful nature of the Project, the County imposed numerous

15 conditions of approval, intended to mitigate the Project's impacts. This fails to recognize that

16 the use of a categorical exemption is not allowed when mitigation measures are required.
CEQA requires potential impacts and the efficacy of mitigation measures be analyzed in an
17 Il environmental review document.

18 5.

19 Additionally, CEQA prevents use of categorical exemptions when unusual

20 circumstances could result in significant adverse impacts and when cumulative impacts could

21 occur. The unusual nature of siting a large commercial wedding venue in a high fire area with

22 limited access, and in an area deemed inappropriate for development by the County's General

23 Plan, is evidenced by the fact that the Project would be the only commercial wedding venue

24 within the County located outside of the designated Urban Development Boundary and

25 Development Corridors. These limits on development were established due to the safety

26 concerns and other impacts associated with development in areas prone to fire with substandard
access. The Project's impacts are exacerbated by the County's recent approval of an additional
27 cumulatively considerable project allowing development of an eco-resort near the Project site.
28

2
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 6. Not only has the County violated CEQA by approving the Project without the
2 required environmental review, but the County has also allowed the Real Parties in Interest to
3 seek piecemeal approvals. Despite documented communications between the Real Parties and
4 the County demonstrating that the Real Parties plan to seek a future expansion on the number of
5 events at the Project site, and a concession by Real Parties that the expansion would require
6 preparation of an environmental impact report, the County failed to consider the whole of the
7 project when approving the Redwood Ranch Project.
8 7. In addition to violating CEQA, the approval of the Project is also inconsistent with
9 the restrictions on development contained within the County's General Plan, including the
10 Foothill Growth Management Plan. The County also lacked the ability to make the findings
11 necessary to approve a special use permit for the Project due to the Project's inconsistencies
12 with the General Plan, lack of compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood, inadequate
13 roadway access and the safety hazards associated with the Project.
14 8. The wholesale violations of CEQA and State Planning and Zoning Law by the
15 County have necessitated the filing of this action to obtain a writ of mandate setting aside
16 approval of the Project until proper environmental review has been prepared and other
17 appropriate relief. Accordingly, Petitioner The Kaweah Coalition requests that this Court issue
18 a peremptory writ of mandate to prevent the County or Real Parties in Interest from taking
19 actions based on the faulty Project approval and to require the preparation of environmental
20 review for the Project.
21

22 JURISDICTION

23 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 and 1094.5 of
24 the Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources
25 Code.

19 STATEMENT OF FACTS
20 Project Site.
21 16.

22 The Project site is a 190-acre parcel located eight miles east of the small

23 unincorporated town of Three Rivers, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
17.

24 The Project site is located in an area with slopes exceeding 30 percent, and often

25 in excess of 90 percent, with significantly exposed south-facing slopes.
18.

26 19. The South Fork Kaweah River runs alongside the Project site.

27 Surrounding land uses include residential homes, homestead sites, cattle ranches

28 and orchards, ecological preserves, and Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") open-space

4

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- conservation lands. The ambient noise levels in this upper South Fork Canyon area are
2 incredibly quiet.

3 20. The South Fork Campground in Sequoia National Park is located roughly four
4 miles further to the east of the Project site on South Fork Drive. Due to the low visitor usage of
5 this campground, it is no longer patrolled by a full-time park ranger or other law enforcement

6 staffing.

7 21. Prior to the operation of Redwood Ranch wedding venue, the Project site was used
as a working ranch. It consisted of a single-family residence with a residential barn outbuilding
9 in open-space rangeland, bordered by similar land uses on all sides for several miles. The 2,184
10 square foot barn was legally converted to a residence to be used for vacation rentals. The site
11 also contains three small cabins, and two single family residences, intended for use by the
12 property owners, their family and the ranch caretaker.
13 22. The ranch continues to maintain cattle, horses, donkeys, goats, peacocks and
14 chickens on the site.

15 Access to the Site is Significantly Substandard
16 23. The single entrance and exit for the Project site is located along South Fork Drive,
17 a substandard Class 3 arterial road. Class 3 arterial roadways standards include pavement
18 widths of 28 feet with 3-foot-wide shoulders, a maximum grade of 10 percent, stopping sight
19 distance of at least 200 feet and embankment slopes 1.5:1 or flatter. South Fork Drive falls far
20 I short of meeting these standards.
21 24. From the unincorporated town of Three Rivers, South Fork Drive continues for
22 roughly six (6) miles on an unlit 18-foot-wide, mountain road with several narrow bridges,
23 many turns with little line of sight, and through the bucolic foothill agricultural community of
24 the South Fork.

25 25. Pavement widths along South Fork Drive narrow considerably at six (6) miles
26 outside of Three Rivers, approaching the Project site, ranging between ten (10) feet and 14 feet.
27 These widths are less than half the required minimum widths for a Class 3 arterial roadway, and
28

5
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 amount to a single lane width that must be navigated cautiously and simultaneously by traffic in

2 both directions. There are few, if any, adequate shoulders for vehicle traffic to safely pass.

3 26. For the two mile stretch prior to the Redwood Ranch wedding venue entrance,

4 stopping sight distance is significantly less than 200 feet. There are multiple blind turns and no

5 reflective delineators or raised pavement markers, no roadway lighting, and no guardrails to

6 protect visitors from steep embankments along the narrow roadway. The pavement also

7 includes numerous potholes and a significant amount of broken pavement.

8 27. No alternative access or evacuation routes exist for the Project site or others living

9 in the area.

10 Wildfire Hazards in the Project Area

11 28. CalFire has also designated the Project site and surrounding area as Very High
12 Fire Severity Zone. CalFire has created this designation because "Wildfires a pose a serious
13 threat to the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety. The wildfire front is not the only
14 source of risk since embers, or firebrands, travel far beyond the area impacted by the front and
15 pose a risk of ignition to a structure or fuel on a site for a longer time." (Gov. Code, § 51175.)
16 The site is also designated Very High Hazard due to fires by the County.
17 29. Fire hazard severity is determined based on a number of factors, including
18 the wildland fuels, topography, especially the steepness of the slopes, and weather (temperature,
19 humidity, and wind) and how vulnerable the site is to new fires.
20 30. Large areas of the steeply sloped Project site contain highly flammable dense

21 chaparral vegetation, including portions of the site designated for the Project. These
22 circumstances present extreme wildland fire potential, as is outlined within the 2017 Tulare

23 County Community Wildfire Protection Plan.
24 31. The CalFire Kaweah Battalion, which provides wildfire prevention and protection

25 in the area of the Project site, has reported there are an average of eight (8) to 15 fire ignitions
26 annually under their jurisdiction. The majority of these fires are ignited by vehicles and

27 electrical power.

28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

I 32. The steep, narrow upper South Fork canyon where the Project site is located
2 contains the highest fire ignition frequency in Tulare County. The second largest wildfire in the
history of the Tulare County area prior to 2008 started in the upper South Fork Kaweah canyon,
4 known as the South Fork Fire of 1928. Thus, the South Fork canyon has the highest fire ignition
5 frequency rate in Tulare County, a history of the largest fires in Tulare County, and it has been
6 92 years since a significant fire has burned in the South Fork canyon, thereby increasing the
7 likelihood of a large-scale wildfire.

8 33. The Tulare County Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan describes the
9 direct correlation to wildfire increase in areas with human access stating: "The risk of wildfire
10 increases where human access exists in high fire hazard severity zones... because of a greater
11 chance for human carelessness and because of historic and current fire management practices."
12 34. These wildfire hazards are exacerbated by inadequate emergency response.
13 Limited resources and the substandard access described above have resulted in inadequate
14 availability of emergency response in the area. The emergency response criterion is 15 minutes,
15 but in the Project area would actually be at least 25 minutes. That would be under the best
16 conditions, with no evacuating traffic hindering access by emergency response vehicles.
17 35. California State Responsibility Areas ("SRAs") are areas of the state where the
18 State of California is financially responsible for the prevention and suppression of wildfires. The
19 Project site and surrounding area are a SRA. California SRA requirements for emergency
20 access and egress require, at a minimum, two ten (10) foot wide traffic lanes to provide for two-
21 way traffic flow to support emergency vehicle and civilian egress. South Fork Drive does not
22 meet this requirement.
23 36. In addition to wildfire response, the Project site is beyond emergency response
24 time criteria for law enforcement and emergency medical services. The nearest ambulance
25 response at Exeter District Ambulance is incapable of making response time requirements to
26 Project site. The manager of the Exeter District Ambulance estimated response times to the
27 Project site could be 50 to 60 minutes, or much longer given the large area the service covers.
28

7
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 37. Residents of the area have observed far longer response times. On the busy

2 weekend night of August 9th 2019, an ambulance was dispatched to the upper South Fork for a

3 motorcycle accident, roughly 3 miles above (east of) the Project site. From the time the incident

4 was reported to dispatch to the extraction of the wounded motorcyclist to the town of Three

5 Rivers, a span of 4 hours went by. On several other occasions along South Fork Dr, ambulances
6 have found themselves stuck on the roadway or lost.

7 South Fork Kaweah River and Water

8 38. The Project site is located along the South Fork Kaweah River. The South Fork

9 Kaweah is a vulnerable water source during summer months and extended drought seasons, with

10 far less cubic water-feet than the Main Fork Kaweah River.

11 39. The a Project site includes a domestic hard rock water well and two septic/leach line

12 systems, built to accommodate the limited use by the single-family residences.

13 40. The current septic systems at Project site are not designed for increased
14 commercial use and pose environmental impacts for downstream users. As the site is located on
15 Blasingame-rock outcrop, on slopes of up to 50 percent, and non-prime class VII soils, there are

16 severe tank absorption issues associated with this septic design. With these sandy and rocky
17 soils at the base of significant slopes, failed leach systems could impact the water quality of the
18 South Fork Kaweah River for downstream users.

19 41. Pumping septic tanks annually does not compensate for leach line and leach field
20 failure, which are designed based on the maximum number of bedrooms on each system. An
21 example of such a failure occurred during the expansion of the Comfort Inn in Three Rivers.

22 The expansion of a new wing of the hotel required the addition of a larger septic tank. However,
23 the system quickly failed because the leach field was not upgraded, leading to relatively fast
24 Igroundwater contamination due to sandy-course soil types with severe absorption issues.
25 42. Increased fire hazards also adversely impact the water quality of the South Fork
26 Kaweah River. It is difficult to compensate for fire hazards in areas of steep topography without
27 causing other significant impacts and hazards, particularly to water quality. Grazing is typically

28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 used to in the area to reduce available fire fuels. The severe slope and topography of exposed
2 areas are often completely denuded towards the end of summer, as animals have been kept on-

3 site during the length of the season and not regularly rotated off-site. Bare soil surfaces disrupt
4 the water cycling process and mimics post-fire conditions. With less ground coverage, these
5 soils can "mineralize". especially on south-facing slopes, causing soils to become

6 "hydrophobic". This can cause rill networks- shallow channels along the slopeswhich carry
7 substantial sediment to rivers.

8 Land Use Plan Restrictions on the Project Site

9 43. The Tulare County General Plan land use designation for the Project site is
10 Foothill Agriculture, and the zoning for the site is AF: Foothill Agriculture.
11 44. The General Plan designation of Foothill Agriculture "establishes areas for
12 agricultural activities primarily located in the foothill and mountain regions where extensive
13 commercial agricultural uses can exist without conflicting with other uses, or where conflicts
14 can be mitigated. Uses typically allowed include orchards and vineyards, grazing of cattle,
15 horses, sheep, and goats on grazing lands, resource extraction activities, facilities that directly
16 support agricultural operations, and other necessary public utility and safety facilities." (Tulare
17 County General Plan p. 4-15.)
18 45. The General Plan sets an Urban Development Boundary ("UDB") to divide land to
19 be developed from land to be protected for agricultural, natural, open space, or rural uses.

20 "Land within an unincorporated UDB is assumed appropriate for development and is not subject
21 to the Rural Valley Lands Plan or Foothill Growth Management Plan." (Tulare County General
22 Plan p. 2-3.) The Project site is located outside of the UDB for Three Rivers and is instead
23 within the area covered by the Foothill Growth Management Plan ("FGMP").
24 46. The FGMP section of the County's General Plan sets out Area Plan policies for
25 the foothill area of Tulare County, including the Project site. The FGMP establishes
26 development corridors, which are areas in the foothills potentially suitable for development.
27 Any development within these corridors must meet specific development criteria. The purpose
28

9
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- of these corridors is to direct growth to specific areas so as

2 "to protect the fragile environment

3 and preserve important agricultural land." (FGMP p. 3-2.) Development sites must be located

4 a within a 15-minute response time from a Tulare County fire station, a have a slope of less than 30

5 percent, and not have other features that could result in adverse impacts, such as a designation of
very high fire hazard.

6 47.

7 The Project site is located outside of any development corridor. The non-corridor

8 areas of the foothills "do not have development potential at this time" and are set aside for

9 foothill agriculture. (FGMP pp. 3-4, 3-5.) The Project site is located in an area mapped as an

10 area of "the foothills where development may not occur due to access constraints, emergency

11 response time, slope, and other biological or archeological factors that prohibit safe
development." (FGMP p. 3-2.)

12 48.

13 The FGMP prohibits development in chaparral and requires protection of special
status species habitat. (FGMP policies 8.15, 8.14.)
14 49.

15 The FGMP also includes a number of policies addressing water supply and water

16 and wastewater infrastructure capacity. (FGMP policies 9.1 to 9.5.)

50.

17 FGMP policy 10.2 requires development be adequately served by existing Tulare

18 County fire stations. The remainder of the General Plan also includes a number of policies to

19 prevent fire hazard impacts, including limits on development in very high fire hazard areas.
51. The Project site is not zoned for visitor-serving commercial uses. It is zoned
20 Foothill Agriculture, which "is an exclusive zone for intensive and extensive foothill agricultural
21

22 uses and for those uses which are a necessary and integral part of intensive and extensive

23 foothill agriculture operations." (Tulare County Zoning Code 10.3A.) This zone is intended to

24 "protect the general welfare of the foothill agricultural community from encroachments of

25 unrelated uses which, by their nature, would be injurious to the physical and economic well-

26 being of the foothill agricultural community and the community at large." (Ibid.)
52.

27 The County's Zoning Code identifies uses that are allowed in the Foothill

28 Agriculture zone. Guest Ranches are allowed in this zone with a use permit. (Tulare County

10
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P Zoning Code 10.3D-8.) Guest Ranches are defined as "Buildings and premises offering
2 recreational facilities for such pursuits as horseback riding, swimming, and hiking with living
3 and dining accommodations."

4 53. The Zoning Code defines an Assemblage of People as "a temporary gathering
5 together of any number of persons, at any location, at any single time when rent or

6 compensation of any form is paid for use of a venue for educational, entertainment or
7 commercial purposes." An Entertainment Assemblage is "Any use where the primary goal of
8 those assembled is to promote amusement, enjoyment, pleasure, recreation, diversion,
9 relaxation, and other similar uses."

10 54. An assemblage of people for entertainment are limited to 12 events per year and
11 only allowed in the Foothill Agriculture zone if the following minimum conditions can be met:
12 1. The proposed use is consistent with the County's general plan, any applicable
13 community plan or area plan, and the provisions of this ordinance.
14 2. The proposed location shall meet the minimum acreage requirements and be adequate
15 in land area so as to accommodate the proposed project, its required parking area, access,
16 and site improvements.
17 3. The proposed land use is compatible with neighboring land use and zoning.
18 4. The public and private roads providing access to the subject property meet necessary
19 standards to provide safe and adequate access, or have been amended by conditions of
20 approval to satisfy the access requirements.
21 5. A Special Use Permit shall be granted only if it is found that the establishment,
22 maintenance and operation of the use of building or land applied for will not, under the
23 circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals,
24 comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood, or to the
25 general welfare of the County. Special Use Permits may be granted subject to such
26 conditions as will ensure compliance with the aforementioned standards.

3 55.

4 a guest Real Parties acquired the Project site in 2014 and converted the existing barn into
house for use as a small vacation rental residence.

5 56.

6 In 2016, Real Parties began illegally operating the Redwood Ranch Project site as

7 a large wedding venue in 2016 without the required permits. Real Parties advertised use of the

8 site as a wedding venue for hundreds of guests with no curfew and with on-site camping
available for wedding guests.

9 57.

10 Area residents, including members of The Kaweah Coalition, documented

11 numerous impacts after the wedding venue began operating.
58.

12 Petitioner and neighbors have consistently been kept awake by loud amplified

13 dance music and live bands late into the night and early morning hours. From certain locations

14 on properties as far away as 2.5 miles down the South Fork Canyon, the loud cheers and

15 screams of party goers have been heard. Electronic bass reverberates and can be heard indoors,

16 with the windows and doors closed, at least two (2) miles down canyon. Petitioner has recorded

17 decibel ("dB") levels at nearby property boundaries during three (3) wedding events with loud

18 amplified music and live bands, and these intrusive noises have consistently exceeded A-

19 weighted noises of 70 dB, exceeding County noise limits. Impacts of this noise on the area

20 wildlife, in addition to impacts to nearby residents with children, were repeatedly voiced to the
County.
21 59.

22 Lighting at the Redwood Ranch Project consists of large amounts of cafe string

23 lights, which reflect considerable lighting upward into the night sky. Additional LED blue

24 lights wrapped around trees, multi-colored LED lights around the dance floor, and even disco

25 balls and strobe lights have made Redwood Ranch very visible and distracting to nearby

26 residents in the South Fork Canyon, resulting in at least one full-time resident opting to stay in

27 Lemon Cove during wedding events. The lighting, as witnessed by Petitioner over the 2018 and

28 2019 seasons, consistently shines onto Grouse Peak BLM lands and the Kaweah Brodiaea

2 60. On a number of occasions, area residents contacted law enforcement to file a
3 complaint due to excessive noise levels. When residents have called after 10:30 p.m., law

4 enforcement was not able to respond until up to four (4) hours later, at which point there was no
5 violation to enforce. Due to lack of adequate response times for law enforcement and lack of
6 on-site compliance monitoring during wedding events, violations have continued in the remote
7 South Fork Canyon.

8 61, After numerous complaints and reports of these violations to the County from area
9 residents, including members of The Kaweah Coalition, the County finally issued a Code
10 Compliance Violation in December 2018 for the Real Parties' unpermitted operation of a
11 wedding venue.

12 62. The County's Project Review Committee discussed the Project on January 24,
13 2019. Real Parties then submitted the required application for a Special Use Permit and Zoning
14 Variance in response to the active Code Compliance Violation on April 2, 2019, five years after
15 they began operating. The Special Use Permit is required for Assemblages of People, but
16 restricts the number of events to 12 per year. Real Parties had already booked more than 12
17 events for the year, and had held more than 12 events in prior years, thus a Zone Variance was
18 also required to exempt them from the 12-event limit.
19 63. The Project application contained a highly misleading project description. Many
20 of the inaccuracies in the application were documented by Petitioner:
21 The application claims events would be limited to only up to 100 guests, but
22 brochures for the Redwood Ranch advertised the site as being able to
23 accommodate up to 300 guests.
24 The application claimed that each wedding event, with hundreds of guests and the
25 requirement to haul all services to the site, would have only two (2) roundtrip
26 vehicle trips.

5 The application failed to disclose that the venue also allows for camping for

6 several hundred people throughout the entire 190-acre site at any time, for a per

7 person charge, instead claiming only one (1) acre would be used.

8 The application claimed Redwood Ranch did not begin operations until March

O 2018, but community members had documented that the site had been in use as a
wedding venue since 2015.

10

11 The application claimed that events would end at 10 p.m., but area residents

12 submitted testimony that they had witnessed events lasting beyond 1 a.m. and

13 evidence that the Project site is advertised as having no curfew.

14 The application claimed Mid-Valley Disposal handles waste disposal for the

15 Project site, but failed to disclose that due to the inaccessibility of the site, Mid-

16 Valley does not pick up trash at the Project site.

17 The application claimed no alcohol would be served, when photographs from

18 numerous events show service of alcoholic beverages at events.

19 The application further claimed that there would be no amplified music at events;

20 to the contrary, area residence submitted evidence detailing the noise impacts of

21 64. amplified music lasting into the morning hours, resulting in numerous noise
complaints being registered with the County.

22

23 This inaccurate Project description that was provided by the Real Parties was the

24 basis for the Project description circulated to commenting agencies. The County did not

25 recirculate a revised Project description that acknowledged the true extent of Project operations

26 and impacts to commenting agencies. Thus, the responsible commenting agencies reviewed

27 incomplete and inaccurate Project descriptions, detailing the number of vehicle trips at just two

28 (2) per event, no amplified sound or music, no alcohol provisions, among the long list of
demonstrably false descriptions.

1 65. The County put a temporary hold on violation enforcement to allow the wedding
2 venue to continue operating during the administrative process, with at least 24 weddings held
3 throughout the 2019 season without a permit or any administrative project approval.
4 66. On October 21, 2019, prior to Planning Commission review of the Project, the
5 County's Planning Director approved a Temporary Use Permit to allow four events at Redwood

6 Ranch during the remainder of 2019. These events were held October 25-27, November 1-4,
7 November 8-10 and November 14-18, 2019. There had already been 20 other large events held
8 at Redwood Ranch throughout 2019 when this Temporary Use Permit was approved. No
9 environmental review was prepared for this Temporary Use Permit.
10 67. In November 2019, correspondence between the County and Real Parties
11 demonstrate a change in tactics regarding the Project. The Real Parties decided to "get the use
12 permit approved before trying for the Zone Variance." The attorney for Real Parties stated in a
13 letter to the County: "Trrespective of the SUP process, and what happens at the planning
14 commission, that process will not provide the full entitlements that Redwood Ranch is seeking.
15 Therefore, we want to commence the EIR for the full project plan now. Even if the SUP is
16 granted for 12 events per year, the Redwood Ranch has it's 13th event of 2020 booked for early
17 August so our admittedly ambitious goal is to complete the EIR and the grant of entitlements
18 prior to that date."

19 68. The County agreed to this plan, acknowledging "The applicants and [the Resource
20 Management Agency Director] want to separate the projects out and just go for the 12 events
21 this time."

22 69. While the Real Parties revised the Redwood Ranch website to only list 12 events
23 for 2020, Petitioner has identified additional wedding events exceeding this limit of 12 events
24 from details posted publicly on wedding hosting and booking websites. This information is in
25 addition to Real Parties' own admission that it had already booked more than 12 events and that
26 the 13th event is booked for early August.
27 70. The Project considered by the Planning Commission would allow 20 indoor guests

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 within the Guest Ranch barn, and up to 80 additional on-site campers any night of the year under

2 the "Guest Ranch" Use Permit. Wedding assemblages permit up to 250 maximum guests, and

3 are required to rent the Guest Ranch barn. The Guest Ranch and Assemblage use permits are

4 combined to create commercial wedding events, at first proposed with a Zone Variance to allow

5 more than 12 events per year.

6 71. The Project would be the only wedding venue within the County located outside

7 of an Urban Development Boundary and located outside of a Development Corridor.

8 72. The Tulare County Fire Inspector calculated a maximum occupancy for the

9 Project site of 150 persons, despite the Project including a much higher limit of 250 guests, not
10 | including event staff.
11 73. No alternative emergency evacuation route to or from Redwood Ranch exists and

12 no emergency evacuation plan was submitted for the Project. Based on Petitioner's observations,
13 just two shuttle vans are used during weddings and are rarely on-site during the entire duration
14 of the event as they shuttle guests throughout the night. With a 15-passenger seating capacity,
15 many trips would be required during an emergency evacuation of the Project site. Evacuations
16 could also hinder Fire Department access to the site and upper South Fork Canyon because
17 South Fork Road narrows to one (1) lane in many locations.
18 74. The County Planning Commission held a hearing on the Project on December 11,

19 2019, at which the Commission unanimously approved the Project. This approval was based
20 upon a Class 1 categorical exemption to CEQA.

21 75. At the Planning Commission hearing, Commissioners expressed concerns

22 regarding the lack of emergency response, insufficient fire evacuation access, and dangerous
23 roadways, but the County staff incorrectly stated those issues had been addressed and approved
24 by Tulare County Fire Department. The Tulare County Fire Department did not sign off on
25 emergency access and egress for the Project. The Fire Department's Fire Safety Plan was also
26 misrepresented to the Commissioners.
27 76. More than 20 neighbors, including members of The Kaweah Coalition, presented

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RBLIEF

1 oral testimony at the Planning Commission hearing, providing personal observations of the
2 numerous impacts and disruptions to quality of life resulting from the Project. This included
3 next door neighbors to the Project site, the Hueckers, who testified that party music from events
4 at the Project site routinely kept them and their children awake.

5 77. The Planning Commission ignored evidence regarding the applicants' plans to
6 piecemeal the Project to avoid environmental review. The Commission deemed all previous
7 disruptions and impacts irrelevant to the Project, but failed to adopt mitigation, monitoring and
8 compliance plans adequate to ensure impacts would be mitigated.

9 78. Petitioner and others appealed the Planning Commission approval on December
10 20, 2019.

11 79. The Board of Supervisors held a hearing on the appeal on February 25, 2020. The
12 Supervisors approved the Special Use Permit for the Project at that hearing.
13 80. The County issued a Notice of Exemption for the Project on February 25, 2020.

15 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

16 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

17

18 81. Petitioner The Kaweah Coalition objected to the Project in the administrative
19 process by submitting letters during the comment period, providing testimony at public meetings
20 regarding the Project and filing administrative appeals.
21 82. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief. In
23 the absence of such remedies, the County's approval of the Project would form the basis for a
24 development project that would proceed in violation of state law.
25 83. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
26 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 VIOLATION OF CEQA)

9 86. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

10 87. CEQA requires the County to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
11 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004).

12 The County has failed to do so in violation of CEQA.

13 The County Failed to Prove the Project Fits Within a Categorical Exemption
14 88. The County has relied on a Class categorical exemption to approve the Project,
15 under CEQA Guidelines section 15301.

16 89. Class 1 categorical exemptions exempt: "the operation, repair, maintenance,

17 permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures,
18 facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion

19 of existing or former use...The key consideration is whether the project involves negligible or
20 no expansion of use." (CEQA Guidelines § 15301, emphasis added.)
21 90. The CEQA Guidelines provide examples of the types of projects that could fit

22 within a Class 1 exemption: 1

23 (a) Interior or exterior alterations involving such things as interior partitions,

24 plumbing, and electrical conveyances;
25 (b) Existing facilities of both investor and publicly-owned utilities used to provide
26 electric power, natural gas, sewerage, or other public utility services;

27 (c) Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and pedestrian trails,
28

18
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 and similar facilities ...

2 (d) Restoration or rehabilitation of deteriorated or damaged structures, facilities, or
3 mechanical equipment to meet current standards of public health and safety, unless it is
4 determined that the damage was substantial and resulted from an environmental hazard
5 such as earthquake, landslide, or flood;

6 (e) Additions to existing structures provided that the addition will not result in an
7 increase of more than:

8 (1) 50 percent of the floor area of the structures before the addition, or
9 2,500 square feet, whichever is less; or
10 (2) 10,000 square feet if: (A) The project is in an area where all public
11 services and facilities are available to allow for maximum development
12 permissible in the General Plan and (B) The area in which the project is
13 located is not environmentally sensitive.
14 (f) Addition of safety or health protection devices for use during construction of or
15 in conjunction with existing structures, facilities, or mechanical equipment, or
16 topographical features including navigational devices;
17 (g) New copy on existing on and off-premise signs;
18 (h) Maintenance of existing landscaping, native growth, and water supply
19 reservoirs..;

20 (i) Maintenance of fish screens, fish ladders, wildlife habitat areas, artificial
21 wildlife waterway devices, streamflows, springs and waterholes, and stream channels
22 (clearing of debris) to protect fish and wildlife resources;
23 (i) Fish stocking by the California Department of Fish and Game;
24 (k) Division of existing multiple family or single-family residences into common-
25 interest ownership and subdivision of existing commercial or industrial buildings, where
26 no physical changes occur which are not otherwise exempt;
27 (1) Demolition and removal of individual small structures listed in this subdivision;
28

19
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

•

2 (1) One single-family residence. In urbanized areas, up to three single-

• family residences may be demolished under this exemption.

A (2) A duplex or similar multifamily residential structure. In urbanized areas,
this exemption applies to duplexes and similar structures where not more
than six dwelling units will be demolished.

7 (3) A store, motel, office, restaurant, and similar small commercial
structure if designed for an occupant load of 30 persons or less. In

Ö urbanized areas, the exemption also applies to the demolition of up to three

10 such commercial buildings on sites zoned for such use.

11 (4) Accessory (appurtenant) structures including garages, carports, patios,

12 swimming pools, and fences.

13 (m) Minor repairs and alterations to existing dams and appurtenant structures

14 under the supervision of the Department of Water Resources.

15 (n) Conversion of a single family residence to office use.

16 (o) Installation, in an existing facility occupied by a medical waste generator, of a

17 steam sterilization unit for the treatment of medical waste generated by that facility ....

18 (p) Use of a single-family residence as a small family day care home, as defined in

19 Section 1596.78 of the Health and Safety Code.

20 (CEQA Guidelines § 15301.)
91.

21 Project. None of the examples provided for a Class 1 categorical exemption apply to the

22 92.

23 Categorical exemptions may be provided only for "classes of projects which have

24 a been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment...." and should be construed

25 in light of that authorization. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21084, subd. (a).)

93.

26 Categorical exemptions are strictly construed, "in order to afford the fullest

27 possible environmental protection," (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water

28 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.) It is the County's burden to prove that the

Printed on Recycled Paper 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 proposed Project fits within this class of categorical exemption. (California Farm Bureau Fed'n
2 V. California Wildlife Conservation Bd., (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 185-86.) The County has

3 failed to meet its burden in proving the Project correctly fits within a Class 1 categorical

4 exemption.

5 94. The Project involves a new use, which a is not an allowable under this exemption.

6 The Project is a commercial wedding venue for up to 250 guests. Prior to use of the Project site

7 a as a commercial wedding venue, the site was used as working farm with a guest cottage that

8 could accommodate up to six visitors. The Project involves significantly more than a negligible

9 expansion of existing or former uses, making a Class 1 exemption unavailable.
10 95. The County also violated CEQA when approving a temporary use permit for

11 operation of the wedding venue for a limited number of events prior to Project approval without
12 any CEQA review.

13 96. Further, the County decided to address Real Parties' violations of the County Code
14 for operating the Project prior to receiving necessary approvals by requiring the Real Parties to
15 apply for the necessary approvals. The County cannot use this decision as the basis for
16 determining the Project would not increase existing uses.

17

18 Exceptions to Categorical Exemption Apply
19 97. Even if the Project did fit within the Class 1 categorical exemption, which it does
20 not, the exemption would be inapplicable because several exceptions to categorical exemptions
21 apply. (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2.)

22 98. A categorical exemption is "inapplicable when the cumulative impact of
23 successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant." (CEQA
24 § Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (b).) The cumulative impact exception ensures that a project's
25 potential cumulative impacts are not overlooked when a categorical exemption is a applied
26 because "environmental damage often occurs incrementally from a variety of small sources."
27 (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720.) This

2 exception to categorical exemption applies if the lead agency is presented with "evidence that

3 there was a fair argument that the cumulative impact exception applied." (Apios Residents Assn.

4 V. County of Santa Cruz (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1039, 1052.)
99.

5 Here, the County also recently approved the Sunshine Paradise Guest Ranch

6 within one mile of the Project site. Both projects are located on the steep and extremely narrow

7 South Fork Drive, each adding a significant number of cars to this substandard roadway and

8 together overwhelming the roadways very limited capacity. Both projects are also located on

9 Very High Fire Hazard sites, cumulatively adding to the fire risk in this area by bringing

10 numerous people and vehicles, both of which could easily ignite a deadly fire into this area.

11 Additionally, both project sites contain extensive mixed chaparral vegetation, where the

12 County's Foothill Growth Management Plan restricts development due to extreme wildland fire
potential. (FGMP Policy 8.15.).

13 100.

14 The Redwood Ranch Project and the Sunshine Paradise Guest Ranch are both

15 located along the South Fork Kaweah River, bringing visitors to this important habitat and water

16 source, resulting in potential biological, water quality and water use impacts. The projects may

17 also cause cumulatively considerable water supply impacts through their use of additional water

18 in this area where there is no additional water supply capacity.
101.

19 A large luxury camping facility is another reasonably foreseeable cumulative
project. This project, the «Under Canvas" project, would develop a luxury campground with
20 room for approximately 300 campers. Access to this site would be provided via side roads off
21

22 of South Fork Drive. This project, for which an application has been filed, would have

23 cumulative traffic and fire hazard impacts with-the Redwood Ranch and Sunshine Paradise
Ranch projects.
24 102. A categorical exemption is also inapplicable when "there is a reasonable
25 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
26 Il circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c).)

27 103.

28 Petitioner provided substantial evidence to the County that the Project presents

22

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

unusual circumstances for several reasons.

2 104. First, the Redwood Ranch Project is the only commercial wedding venue in
3 a Tulare County sited within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone. Additionally, it is the only
commercial project in Tulare County that expands use into chaparral vegetation, where
5 development is restricted under the County's General Plan due to "extreme wildland fire

6 potential." These unusual circumstances are different from all other existing commercial
7 wedding venues in the County. There is a reasonable possibility these unusual circumstances

8 could result in increased wildfire hazards, making a categorical exemption unavailable.
9 105. The Project is also the only commercial wedding venue located outside of the
10 County's designated Urban Development Boundary's ("UDB") Development Corridor. The
11 purpose of establishing this UDB was to reduce wildfire, traffic, biological and other impacts.
12 106. Additionally, certified Civil Engineer Tom Brohard found the sole roadway
13 providing access to the up to 250 wedding guests, plus vendors, at the Project site, has specific
14 hazards and dangerous conditions which fail to meet Tulare County roadway improvement
15 standards. Expert Brohard found that required roadway widths are 28 feet, whereas portions of
16 the access road to the Project site, South Fork Drive, are only 10 to 14 feet wide. He found it to
17 be an unusual circumstance for a roadway providing sole access to several hundred persons was
18 less than half the required width. He also found the roadway to be steeply sloped with
19 inadequate sight distance. Traffic safety impacts may occur due to these unusual circumstances,
20 as well as this roadway's deteriorated condition.

21 107. Further, the testimony of dozens of neighbors regarding the lack of adequate
22 emergency evacuation and response provided by this severely substandard road also provides
23 substantial evidence of this unusual and impactful condition. (See Keep Our Mountains Quiet v.
24 County of Santa Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714, 730.)
25 108. The operation of the Project's large commercial wedding facility in a quiet,
26 bucolic canyon is also an unusual circumstance, which results in adverse noise and night
27 lighting impacts to the surrounding community and wildlife.
28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Categorical Exemptions Cannot Be Used If Mitigation Is Required

2 109. "An agency should decide whether a project is eligible for a categorical
3 exemption as part of its preliminary review of the project without reference to or reliance upon

4 any proposed mitigation measures." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of

5 Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1106.) Reliance on such measures "involves an evaluative

6 process …and that process must be conducted under established CEQA standards and

7 procedures for EIRs or negative declarations." (Id. at 1108.)

8 110. Despite this, the County relies on numerous mitigation measures in the form of

9 conditions of approval to address the Project's impacts. As stated in the County staff report for
10 the Project, the "more than 70 conditions of approval that would apply to this Project would
11 avoid, minimize, or eliminate potential impacts below thresholds of significance."

12 111. The Notice of Exemption further acknowledges the County's reliance on

13 mitigation to address Project impacts, claiming a categorical exemption is applicable because:
14 "Conditions of approval are included to reduce impacts."
15 112. The Project approval includes conditions of approval specific to the potential
16 impacts of the Project, including conditions to reduce noise, address fire hazards and lessen the
17 traffic that would need to use the substandard roadways providing access to the site.
18 113. Whether these measures would in fact reduce impacts below the thresholds of
19 significance must be evaluated in an environmental review document, but was not, in violation
20 of CEQA. By definition, a project does not qualify for a categorical exemption unless the
21 agency has determined environmental impacts cannot occur and mitigation measures are

22 unnecessary, An agency may not "evade these standards by evaluating proposed mitigation
23 measures in connection with the significant effect exception to a categorical exemption." (Azusa
24 Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165,
25 1201.)

26 114. Further, even if reliance on mitigation measures to approve a categorical

27 exemption were appropriate, which it is not, several mitigation measures are not fully

2 enforceable, in violation of CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4, subdivision (a)(2). For example,

3 the County has allowed the Real Parties to voluntarily agree to require shuttle service for

4 weddings with more than 100 guests, but there is no condition of approval included to make this

5 requirement enforceable. Additionally, the Three Rivers area of the County, where the Project

6 site is located, has only one law enforcement officer whose off duty by 9 p.m. Wedding events

7 at the Project site continue beyond this time, resulting in a lack of enforceability of the noise,
lighting, curfew and other conditions after that time.

8

9

10 The County Improperly Segmented the Project

11 115. The CEQA Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation,

12 and operation" to be considered when assessing environmental review for a project. (CEQA

13 Guidelines §15063, subd. (a)(1).) CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has

14 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably

15 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15378, subd.
(a).)

16 116.

17 The County has violated this requirement, improperly piecemealing the approvals
and environmental review for the Project.
18 117.

19 In October 2019, prior to the Board of Supervisors approval of the Project based

20 upon a Class 1 categorical exemption, the County approved a temporary use permit to allow the

21 Project to operate four events. The County did not prepare environmental review for this

22 temporary use permit. The County improperly piecemealed the consideration of this temporary

23 use permit from the remainder of the Project in violation of CEQA.
118.

24 Even more significantly, the County approved only 12 events per year for the

25 Project, despite the fact the Real Parties intended to operate the Project site year-round and had

26 informed the County that they had already booked more than 12 events for 2020.

27 119. To operate year-round, the County determined the Project would require an

28 additional zoning variance, which would require preparation of an environmental review

w

2 document. Instead of analyzing all phases of the Project within the environmental review

3 document, correspondences between the County and Real Parties discloses that the County

4 agreed that Real Parties could retract their application for an additional zoning variance and just

5 seek approval of 12 events at this time to allow the Project to continue to hold events while

6 environmental review was being prepared. Real Parties would then seek approval for additional

7 wedding events in 2020, which evidences demonstrates already have been booked at Project

8 site. The Real Parties claimed that environmental review would be completed by August 2020

9 to allow additional events beyond the initial 12 since the "13th wedding has been booked" in
August 2020.

10 120.

11 By using an inappropriate categorical exemption and failing to consider "the

12 whole of the project" (CEQA Guidelines § 15378), the lead agency has abused its discretion by
failing to proceed in a manner required by law.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (VIOLATIONS OF PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

17 121.

18 Petitioner incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
the previous paragraphs.

19 122. The Project must be consistent with the County's General Plan, which includes
20 the Foothill Growth Management Plan. (Govt. Code § 65300.5; Families Unafraid to Uphold

21

22 Rural Etc. County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336.) To be consistent

23 with a general plan, a project "must be compatible with the objectives, policies, general land

24 uses and programs specified in the general plan." (Spring Valley Lake Association V. City of
Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 99, citations omitted.) A county's consistency
25 determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, determining whether the county
26

27 "reasonably could have made a determination of consistency." (Ibid.)

28 123. The Project is inconsistent with the County's General Plan because it allows a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 commercial wedding venue outside of the Urban Development Boundary and outside of the
2 Foothill Growth Management Plan Development Corridors, both of which are fundamental
3 development limits contained within the General Plan. The Project site is located outside of a
4 15-minute response time from a Tulare County fire station, has slopes of greater than 30 percent,
5 is designated as a Very High Fire Severity Zone and lacks adequate roadway access. As a non-
6 corridor area of the foothills, the Project site lacks development potential at this time and has
7 been set aside as foothill agriculture by the General Plan. The County could not reasonably
8 make a determination of consistency.
9 124. The Project is inconsistent with FGMP policies 8.15 and 8.14, which prohibit
10 development in chaparral and require protection of special status species habitat.
11 125. The Project is also inconsistent with FGMP policies addressing water supply and
12 wastewater infrastructure capacity. (FGMP policies 9.1 to 9.5.)
13 126. The Project is not adequately served by existing Tulare County fire stations, in
14 violation of FGMP policy 10.2.
15 127. Even if the Project were allowed under the County's zoning ordinance, the
16 General Plan controls and prohibits this Project. "Because of its broad scope, long-range
17 perspective, and primacy over subsidiary land use decisions, the 'general plan has been aptly
18 described as the * constitution for all future developments' within the city or county.' (Orange
19 Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 152.) "The general
20 Iplan is the charter" to which all subordinate land use plans, including the zoning ordinance, must

5

6 130. Additionally, the findings required to approve SUPs cannot be made. The County

7 lacks the necessary substantial evidence to make the following required findings:

8 1. The proposed use is consistent with the County's general plan, any applicable

9 community plan or area plan, and the provisions of this ordinance.

10 2. The proposed location shall meet the minimum acreage requirements and be adequate

11 in land area so as to accommodate the proposed project, its required parking area, access,
and site improvements.

12

13 3. The proposed land use is compatible with neighboring land use and zoning.

14 4. The public and private roads providing access to the subject property meet necessary

15 standards to provide safe and adequate access, or have been amended by conditions of

16 approval to satisfy the access requirements.

17 5. A Special Use Permit shall be granted only if it is found that the establishment,

18 maintenance and operation of the use of building of® land applied for will not, under the

19 circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals,

20 comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood, or to the
general welfare of the County.

21

22 131. The County's findings fail to "bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence

23 and ultimate decision." (Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514-515.)
24 132.

25 Here, the evidence is clear that the Project would be detrimental to the health,

26 safety, peace and general welfare of area residents and the County as whole due to its increased

27 wildfire hazards, traffic safety impacts and additional impacts.
133.

28 The development of this commercial entertainment facility outside of the Urban

15 137. A judicial declaration and determination is necessary and appropriate at this time
16 in order that the parties ascertain their rights and obligations with respect to the County's
17 obligations under CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, County Code and in order to resolve
18 all controversies between the parties hereto regarding such rights and duties.

19 138. Therefore, Petitioner seeks a declaration that the County's action in approving the
20 Project based upon a categorical exemption, a Project that is inconsistent with the County's
21 General Plan and fails to comply with County Code requirements, is an abuse of discretion, or
22 otherwise fails to comply with the law.
23 139. Unless declaratory relief is granted, the County may approve additional special
24 use permits without CEQA review, that are inconsistent with its General Plan and that lack
25 compliance with the County Code.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act;
Kaweah Coalition v. County of Tulare

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the County of Tulare's failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in approving the Redwood Ranch commercial wedding venue in a remote, high
fire area. The Redwood Ranch Project would import hundreds of people into an area of
extreme fire hazards coupled with severely substandard access roads. The Project also
intrudes on the quiet bucolic nature of the surrounding community in South Fork Canyon.

The County improperly relied upon an inapplicable Class 1 categorical exemption
for this new use. Due to the many impacts associated with the Redwood Ranch Project,
the County relied upon numerous conditions of approval to mitigate these impacts,
despite CEQA's requirement that mitigation measures be analyzed in an environmental
review document. The Project could result in significant adverse impacts due to the
unusual circumstances of the Project; the Project is the only commercial wedding venue
a in a high fire area with limited access, and in an area deemed inappropriate for
development by the County's General Plan. The General Plan's limits on development
were established due to the safety concerns and other impacts associated with
development in areas prone to fire with substandard access. These impacts are
exacerbated by the County's recent approval of a cumulatively considerable project
allowing development of an eco-resort near the Project site.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to
Redwood Ranch Project

Dear Mr. Hill,

Please take notice that Kaweah Coalition plans to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate challenging the County of Tulare's failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), State Planning and Zoning Law and the Tulare County Code in approving the Redwood Ranch commercial wedding venue project, located at 48808 South Fork Drive in a remote, high fire area. The County has improperly relied upon a categorical exemption to approving this project, which would import hundreds of people into an area of extreme fire hazards coupled with severely substandard access roads. The project also intrudes on the quiet bucolic nature of the surrounding community in South Fork Canyon. Additionally, the project fails to comply
with the County's General Plan, including the Foothill Growth Management Plan and County Code provisions intended to address safety concerns and other impacts associated
with development in areas prone to fire with substandard access.
