12 the Project. On or about March 21, 2019 DWR issued a notice of preparation of an EIR for

13 8.

14 draft BIR. On or about December 16, 2019 DWR issued a Notice of Availability to review

15 9. During the public comment period for the draft EIR Petitioner together with othen
16 public agencies and members of the public submitted written comments concerning the draft

17

18 EIR. Petitioner commented that the EIR employed a truncated analysis and evaluation of
significant environmental and water quality impacts resulting in the impacts being underreported,
19 mitigation; measures omitted and generally depriving the public of a meaningful opportunity to

20

21 comment on the EIR due to the omission of relevant information and data in the draft EIR as
required by CEQA.

22 10.3

23 On or about October 2020 the DWR released a final EIR consisting of 912 pages,
including humerous additions, revisions and deletions of important text from the draft EIR.
24 considerable revisions to the mitigation measures presented in the draft EIR while also adding

25 new mitigation measures and deleting existing mitigation measures. This final EIR was not
26 subject to recirculation for public comments about these numerous changes. To put the size of

27 this final EIR and the magnitude of the numerous changes to the draft EIR into an
28 understandable context, CEQA Guideline section 15140 explains that a draft EIR should not

2 exceed one hundred and fifty pages, except for exceptional situations. Thus this final EIR is
more than six times larger than a typical draft EIR.

3 11.

4 12. On or about November 2, 2020 DWR certified the EIR and approved the Project.

5 On or about November 3, 2020, the DWR posted a Notice of Determination
regarding the EIR.

6 13.

7 The Project is discretionary in nature, requiring mandatory substantive findings,

8 The decision-makers were required to exercise judgment and deliberation in determining
whether and how to approve the Project.

9 14. The DWR was presented with substantial evidence that the Project would result in
10 significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated in the EIR.

11 15.1

12 Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the Project.

13 Petitioner's representatives and other members of the public objected orally and in writing, and

14 presented evidence that the Project has the potential to cause significant environmental impacts,
and that the environmental review considered for the Project does not satisfy the minimum
15 requirements of CEQA.

16 16.

17 Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the DWR's full compliance with

18 CEQA, State Planning and Zoning law (in particular the Solano County General Plan), the

19 Williamsoh Act and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.
17.

20 DWR has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, State Planning and

21 Zoning Law (particularly the Solano County General Plan), the Williamson Act and all other
applicable laws when approving the Project.

22 18 Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.

23 19.

24 Petitioner will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmental
impacts that may result from the Project.

25 20.

26 Petitioner has standing to bring this action and seek to compel a public duty in the

27 form of Respondent complying with State and local land use and environmental laws.

21..

28 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code $21167.5 by

ERUM (CRABTREF, SIATAS mailing written notice of this action to DWR.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22: Petitioner has complied with Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc.

2 §388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.

3 23. Petitioner has a right to enforce DWR's mandatory duties under State and local

4 law related to the Project.

5 24: Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary

6 course of law.

7 25. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and

8 Petitioner •by Respondent fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law prior to
9 certifying the EIR and approving the Project. A clear and significant benefit will be
10 independently conferred upon the general public by the Respondent fully satisfying the

11 requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law (in particular the Solano County General

12 Plan), and the Williamson Act. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement

13 of a mandatory duty. The public, of which Petitioner is a member is vitally and beneficially

14 interested in assuring the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief
15 requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that

16 fundamental rules of law would be affected.

17 26.: By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

18 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ

19 of Mandate and other appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to set aside the DWR approval

20 of the Project and certification of the EIR.

21 27: Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

22 arose in Solano County where both the Project Site and Petitioner are located.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Violation of CEQA: DWR Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion and Did Not

25 Comply with the Vital Public Involvement Objective of CEQA by Failing to Provide A

3 Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. Each public agency should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement,

4 formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to environmental issues related to

5 the agency's activities.

6

7 Public Resources Code section 2100(e) states that "[e]very citizen has a responsibility to

8 contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment." Furthermore, if the
deficienciés in an EIR "preclude[] informed decision-making and public participation, the

10 goals of CEQA are thwarted and a prejudicial abuse of discretion has occurred." Bakersfield

30:

12 In this instance Petitioner, other public agencies, and other members of the public,

13 submitted comments about the draft EIR during the designated public comment period.

14 However, the quantity and quality of changes to the draft EIR as part of the final EIR process

15 nullified the statutory purposes and objectives of a public comment period. Due to the wholesale
changes to the draft EIR incorporated by the final EIR

16 process, the public was deprived of

17 meaningful opportunity to comment on the substantially revised EIR actually certified by DWR.

18 Stated slightly differently, the final EIR certified by the DWR is substantially different than the

19 draft EIR subject to public review and comment by Petitioner and other members of the public.

31.

20 For purposes of illustration, more specifically the final EIR changes the text of the

21 draft EIR over at least fifty-three pages, with some pages experiencing multiple changes. The
changed päges include: II-22, II-23, II-24, II-25, 2 II-6, II-27, II-28, II-29 II-30, I-31, I- 34, I-

6 revised at least thirty-nine Biology mitigation measure that had previously been reviewed during
7 the public review period, adding at least fifteen entirely new mitigation measures after the public

8 review period concluded, deleting at least five mitigation measures that had been presented in the

10 modeling narrative, approximately 11 pages of new modeling boundaries and calibrations,
11 approximately 216 pages of new figures and approximately 125 pages of new tables. All of these

12 events occurred after the public comment period concluded and, therefore, were not subject to
13 public scrutiny and formal public comment.

14 36. None of the changes referenced in Paragraphs 34 and 35 above and other changes

16 quality and quantity of changes and revisions to the draft EIR preempted the effectiveness of the

18 EIR that DWR actually certified. Vast portions of the EIR certified by DWR were never subject

19 to a public:comment review as contemplated and required by CEQA.

20 37. The conclusion presented in the final EIR that these changes were not substantial

1 Over 900 pages of text, figures and tables were required to be added to the draft EIR after the
2 public agency received comments from the public and affected public agencies in an attempt to

3 address the inadequacies disclosed by the comments.

4 44. In addition, the wholesale changes to the draft EIR rendered public comments

5 virtually meaningless. The public was deprived of an opportunity to comment on more than fifty-

6 three pages of the draft EIR, 39 different biological mitigation measures including the inclusion

7 of fifteen new Biological measures and the deletion of at least five Biological measure (together

8 with additions, deletions and revisions to numerous mitigation measures concerning othen
environmental topics), 148 pages of new modeling narrative and hundreds of pages of new

3 capacity of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Unit 109, which could result in the permanent loss of

4 40,000 acre-feet of storage. (DEIR, p. II-39.) The DEIR does not propose solutions to replace the
potential loss of Unit 109 storage potential, nor does it propose mitigation for the removal of
5 potential 40,000 acre-foot loss of storage. This represents a permanent and irreversible

Salinity and Bromide.

9 49.

10 In its February 13, 2020 letter commenting on the draft EIR, Petitionen

11 underscored the draft EIR's failure to evaluate the impact of salinity and bromide on municipal
water and municipal water intake operations. Petitioner wrote:

12

13 The DEIR discussion on salinity is considerably sparse and lacking in sufficient detail, to protect the municipal and agricultural beneficial uses in the Delta. No

14 analyses, modeling results, or data are provided in the DEIR or Appendices for agencies to proficiently assess the Project's Impacts. In addition, there is also no

15 discussion, analysis, or modeling of Bromide which is of critical importance to

16 municipal users in the Delta. When municipal water supplies are treated to meet drinking water standards, Bromide can form Bromate a known and regulated

17 carcinogen, which can impact human health. Municipal water purveyors in the Central and South Delta, including CCWD, are highly sensitive to changes in

18 Bromide concentration in the Delta. In the North Delta, the NBA municipal users

19 do inot currently have significant issues with Bromide. However, major land use
changes such as Lookout Slough, have the potential to enhance sea water

20 intrusion upstream of Rio Vista, and elevate Salinity and Bromide above baseline
concentrations. Since many of the water purveyors utilize ozone (to deal with

21 high levels of organics), they would be highly sensitive to changes in Bromide

22 above baseline conditions. A more significant analysis of Salinity.

50.3
23 The DEIR evaluates the Project's impacts on salinity using results from a

24 simulation for 2009, but the selection of a single year does not account for uncertainties and

25 variations found in the hydrologic conditions in the Delta. (DEIR, p. IV.G-22.) The standard

26 technical analyses for CALFED storage projects involve a longer simulation period (either 1922-

27 2003 or 1976-1991) that covers a wide variety of hydrological conditions to evaluate the

28 potential consequences of a project that would change Delta hydrodynamics. Specifically, these

1 length to better demonstrate existing conditions in the Delta. A proper impact analysis requires
2 longer simulation of the project under varying hydrologic conditions to better understand how

3 the Project will impact salinity over time.

4 51. The DEIR's evaluation of the Project's impacts on salinity for drinking waten

5 purposes is legally defective. The draft EIR's analysis fails to demonstrate whether the Project

6 would adversely impact drinking water standards due to different salinity impacts. The drinking

7 water salinity impact discussion is conclusory, and does not refer to supporting information or

8 reports in a way that facilitates a reader locating this information. CEQA requires that relevant
9 information related to potential impacts on the environment be presented in the EIR itself, not
10 hidden away in an appendix or report, in order to fulfill the goals of CEQA as a means of agency
11 accountability.

12 52. In response, Petitioner expressly requested more information and data in order to
13 comply with CEQA and to permit the EIR and the public to evaluate the potential impact to
14 municipal water supplies:

15 As part of the DEIR review, the Solano County Water Agency requested model

16 output information from DWR. Only the model results from the City of Vallejo Pumping Plant will be discussed in this letter, due to its close proximity to the
17 Lookout Slough project, and to illustrate regional concerns in regards to model
confidence. Figure 1 is a time series plot for July-2009 showing measured and
18 modeled EC data for the City of Vallejo's Pumping Plant at Cache Slough. Figure
2 is Scatter Plot showing the Measured vs Modeled EC data for this same time 19 period. The corresponding R2 = 0.09, which indicates very poor correlation. The
20 two figures illustrate the challenge of the RMA model to reasonably simulate EC
during typical summer conditions at the City of Vallejo's Pumping Plant location. 21 This is important, as the Lookout Slough project is located in close proximity to
22 this node, and is an indication of poor model confidence. Additional model analyses, comparisons, and transparency on the model development is needed, to
23 improve overall model confidence and ability to reasonably simulate Project

24 Impacts on water quality.

25 Organic Carbon.

26 53. In its February 13, 2020 letter commenting on the draft EIR, Petitioner
27 also noted that the draft EIR failed to evaluate the impact of the potential for increased

28
HEFJM CRABTRE SUNTAS ATTORREYE
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P organic carbon from the Project to adversely impact municipal water quality. Petitioner

2 wrote;

3 the DEIR does not include any discussion or analysis of Organic Carbon.

4 While Organic Carbon may have ecological benefits, it can also have significant
impacts on municipal water quality. In the drinking water treatment process,
5 Organic Carbon can react with Chlorine to form a variety of Disinfection Byproducts including Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Haloacetic Acids (HAAs)
6 which are carcinogenic and harmful to human health. The NBA water purveyors

7 are highly sensitive to Organic Carbon levels, as users will often need to blend or switch water sources (if possible), or aggressively treat NBA source water to
8 maintain safe high-quality municipal drinking water standards. Additionally, the NBA currently experiences the poorest water quality throughout the entire SWP 9 in regards to Total Organic Carbon (TOC) levels, as illustrated by Figure 1. Major
10 land use changes such as Lookout Slough, have the potential to export Organic Carbon and/or modify hydrodynamic process that may further degrade NBA
11 municipal water quality.

12 54. In its response to comments, DWR states: "[t]he Draft EIR did not include an
13 analysis of the Proposed Project effect on TOC because there is no regulatory standard to form
14 significant; threshold to determine effects on TOC levels". However, the obligation to prepare
15 good faith responses to comments to an environmental impact is not dispensed with in instances
16 where no regulatory standard to form a threshold of significance for the identified impact.
17 Furthermore, DWR did not plain why the absence of a regulatory threshold of significance
18 precluded DWR from preparing a good faith response to the comment or alternatively
19 formulating a non-regulatory created threshold of significance for this situation. This is
20 inconsistent with the fact that CALFED agencies, of which DWR is a member, adopted its own
21 TOC water quality target in its August 2000 Record of Decision as follows:
22 CALFED Agencies' target for providing safe, reliable, and affordable drinking
23 water in a cost-effective way, is to achieve either: (a) average concentrations at Clifton Court Forebay and other southern and central Delta drinking water intakes
24 of 50 ug/L bromide and 3.0 mg/L total organic carbon, or (b) an equivalent level of public health protection using a cost effective combination of alternative source 25 waters, source control and treatment technologies.

2 Petitioner also commented that the draft EIR omitted significant municipal waten
intakes and the potential hydrodynamic changes caused by the Project:

3

4 In addition, the DEIR does not discuss the importance and sensitivity of Contra Costa Water District's (CCWD's) four municipal intakes located at Mallard

5 Slough, Rock Slough, Old River and Victoria Canal which can be highly influenced by hydrodynamic changes in the Delta and Suisun Marsh. In addition,

6 it should be noted that CCWD provides municipal water to over 500,000 residents

7 in Contra Costa County and the NBA to 500,000 residents in Napa and Solano Counties. The City of Vallejo also has water rights that predate the State Water

8 Project (SWP) on Cache Slough, and provides municipal drinking water to over 120,000 residents within the City as well as Travis Air Force Base.

9 56.: This omission results in omitting and overlooking potential impacts, relevant data and
10 information, and resulted in a defective evaluation of a significant environmental impact.
11

12 Certifying the EIR amounts to a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.
- FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13

14 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts to Agriculture.

15 57.1 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

16 in Paragraphs 1 through 56.

17 58 Water quality and water level impacts resulting from the Project may reduce the

18 ability of existing agricultural water diverters to meet the water needs of their agricultural crops.

19 This in turn could suppress food production, or cause some acreage to be fallowed. The potential

20 impacts to agriculture from changed operations at water intakes constitute a directly foreseeable

21 impact on the physical environment due to the Project; however, these impacts were not studied

22 in the EIR,

23 59. .The Project directly converts significant land currently in agricultural production

24 to non-agricultural uses. Contrary to the undocumented conclusion in the draft EIR, agricultural

25 i conservatión easements do not lessen the significance of the loss of agricultural land. Instead

26 I conservation easements are not valid mitigation for the loss of agricultural land because such

27 easements in no way offset the actual loss of agricultural land involved in a project, but instead

28 merely prevent other agricultural land in the region from also being developed. The draft EIR

2 of this farmland. The failure of this measure to mitigate the impact of removing these lands from

3 agricultural production results in the impact remaining significant and unavoidable. DWR, in this

4 instance, failed to make the required Statement of Overriding Consideration.
60.

5 A deficient analysis of the potential loss of agricultural land or threatened

6 reduction in the productivity of agricultural land rendered the EIR legally insufficient and it was

7 an abuse of discretion for DWR to certify the EIR. In addition, the agricultural conservation

8 easement mitigation measure does not lessen the impact from the loss of agricultural land and the
imposition of this mitigation measure was an abuse of discretion.

11 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts Of
The Increase of Endangered Species Intended To Be Created By

12 The Project on Agricultural and Municipal Water Users.

13 61. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

14 in Paragraphs 1 through 60.

15 62.: Petitioner's comments on the DEIR noted a complete failure to evaluate the

16 impacts of the increased endangered species intended to be created from the Project on both

17 agricultural and municipal users:

18 the DEIR and Appendices do not include any analysis, assessment, potential

19 impacts, or recommended solutions to minimize impacts to existing agricultural
and municipal users in the Delta and specifically within the [Cache Slough

20 ComplexJCSC. Within the CSC, several public agencies including SCWA and

21 Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (via the NBA), City of Vallejo, and Reclamation District 2068 have major diversion facilities, as well

22 as numerous private agricultural intakes. as part of Appendix E (Good Neighbor Checklist), DWR has not adequately addressed one of the key elements,

23 which is "...are species on the project site expected to increase markedly in

24 abundance and move from the site to neighboring lands or waterways?"

63.:
25 DWR'S response addressed only agricultural diversions; and that response is

26 inadequate, stating only:

27 Agricultural diversions in the region of the Proposed Project are currently located
in critical habitat for several listed fish species, and thus they are already subject

28 to compliance with the state and federal endangered species acts. Therefore, the

2 enyironmental effect of the Proposed Project that must be analyzed and mitigated by DWR in the EIR.

3

4 The response is nonsensical; the presence of listed and endangered species at the location of
agricultural diversions makes diversion difficult or impossible. The Project is intended to

6 increase the population of listed and endangered species; therefore, the Project will adversely

7 impact the ability of agricultural water users to divert water in the location of the Project. This
adverse impact was ignored in the DEIR, and summary dismissed in the FEIR.

8 64.1

9 The DEIR did not discuss how the Project's intended consequence of increasing

10 the numbers of listed and endangered species would adversely impact the ability of municipal

11 water users to divert. Despite Petitioner's comments pointing out this deficiency, DWR did not
respond to;these comments, or evaluate the potential impact.

12 65. At the NBA, the location at which water is diverted to Petitioners and others to

13

14 serve a population of over 500,000 people in Napa and Solano County, DWR's operations are

15 governed by a 2019 USFWS Biological Opinion and March 2020 Incidental Take Permit that

16 imposes restrictions on the amount of water that can be pumped in relation to the number of delta
smelt present. For example, the Incidental Take Permit provides:

17 From March through June 30 of dry and critical water years, Permittee shall

18 reduce maximum seven-day average diversion rate at BSPP [Barker Slough

11 68.: CEQA Guideline section 15125(d) requires a legally sufficient EIR to "discuss

12 any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans, specific plans

13 and regional plans."

14 692 The draft EIR did not evaluate and analyze the conflicts between the uses
15 proposed by the Project and the Solano County General Plan.

16 70. A general plan is the "constitution" for long term planning in the area and the
17 general plan sits atop the land use hierarchy of land use regulations.

18 71. The uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano General Plan. The
19 General Plan land use designation for the property subject to this Project is "Agriculture". The
20 uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano County General Plan. A general plan
21 divides a jurisdiction into designated land use areas and generally assigns land uses to each

13 Violation of CEQA: Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Mitigate Energy Impacts

14 76. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

15 in Paragraphs 1 through 75.

16 77. CEQA Guidelines Appendix F states that CEQA "requires that EIRs include a
17 discussion of the potential energy impacts of proposed projects." Appendix F contains detailed
18 specific items that must be included in a legally sufficient analysis of energy impacts by an
19 I environmental impact report.

20 78. The EIR does not disclose the extent to which the Project will create energy
21 impacts. See draft EIR at pp.11-114.
22 79. The EIR did not discuss any means or methods of avoiding or reducing
23 inefficient, wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy from this Project as required by
24 Appendix F.
25 80. The EIR failed to satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA Guidelines

26 Appendix F, CEQA Guidelines §15126.4(a)(1), and Pub.Res.C. $21100(b)(3).
27 81. An environmental impact report cannot dispense with needed analysis by
28 concluding a project complies with Title 24 or other general standards. "Although the Building

1 Code addresses energy savings for components of new commercial construction, it does not

2 address many of the considerations required under appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. These
3 considerations include whether a building should be constructed at all, how large it should be,

4 where it should be located, whether it should incorporate renewable energy resources, or

5 anything else external to the building's envelope. ..[C]ompl[ing] with the Building Code does

6 not, by itself, constitute an adequate assessment of mitigation measures that can be taken to

7 address the energy impacts during construction and operation of the project." California Clean

8 Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App. 4th 173 211. Thus applying Title
9 24 is insufficient to assess the effect and mitigation measures.

10 82.g The Appendix F CEQA mandate is implemented by instructing public agencies:
11 "[p]otentially significant energy implications of a project should be considered in an EIR," and
12 describing several energy-related issues to be evaluated such as energy efficiency, effects to

13 energy supplies, effects on peak and base period demands, compliance with existing energy
14 standards, and transportation energy consumption. Id. at (IN)(C). Appendix F explains that

15 compliance starts with the EIR's project description. To produce a legally sufficient analysis, the
16 Guidelines, direct an EIR's project description to include a discussion of:

17 • energy consuming equipment to be used by the project (App. F II.A.1.);

18 * energy requirements of the project by fuel type (App. F II.A.2.);

19 energy conservation equipment (App. F II.4.3.);

20 energy costs (App F. II.A.4.); and

21 energy consumption per vehicle trip (App F. II.A.5.).

22 Likewise, ;Appendix F suggests an EIR's "environmental setting" section "include existing

23 energy supplies and energy use patterns in the region and locality."

24 83. The DEIR omits any discussion of energy consuming equipment to be used by the
25 Project, energy requirements of the Project by fuel type, energy conservation equipment, energy

26 costs, or energy consumption per vehicle trip in the "Project Description" section as required by

27 the Guidelines. Further, the environmental setting fails to disclose existing energy supply and

11 The Williamson Act authorizes counties to adopt a program whereby landowners

12 voluntarily restrict the possible uses of real property in exchange for more favorable methods of

13 calculating real property tax rates. Solano County has entered into the Williamson Act program
and the Project is located on a substantial amount of real property subject to enforceable

If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper.
