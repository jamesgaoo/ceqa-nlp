20 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Discovery Builders, Inc. and Faria Land Investors, LLC
21 .(collectively, "Petitioners"), by this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
22| Declaratory Relief (*Petition"), allege as follows:

23 INTRODUCTION

24 l. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the decision by the East Bay Regional
25 Park District and its Board of Directors (collectively, "EBRPD") to approve: Land Use Plan and
26 Final Environmental Impact Report (*FEIR") for the proposed 2,543-acre Concord Hills Regional
27 Park Project (*Concord Hills Project") in Contra Costa County. EBRPD's actions violated the
28 California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). Califomia Public Resources Code Section

21000, et seq., and its implementing Guidelines, 14 California Code Regulations Section 15000, et
2 seq. ("Guidelines"), because EBRPD failed to comply with CEQA in the required environmental

3 review.

4 2. Petitioners are property developers with deep ties to the community, and a long

5 history of development in the City of Concord and Contra Costa County. Faria Land Investors,
6 LLC owns approximately 607 acres of property immediately adjacent to the Concord Hills
7 Project, on which Petitioners plan to construct a residential development (*Faria Project").
8 Petitioners maintain their corporate offices in Concord, California within approximately one mile
9 of the Concord Hills Project, and thus within the potential impact area of the Concord Hills
10 Project. Given the close proximity of Petitioners' development and offices to the Concord Hills
11 Project, Petitioners object to, and are affected by, the insufficient level of environmental review
12 applied to the Concord Hills Project and its impacts to future residents of the Faria Project and to
13 Petitioners' corporate officers and employees.

14 3. The Concord Hills Project is one component of the larger redevelopment of the
15 former Concord Naval Weapons Station ("CNWS") military base. Consisting of 5,046 acres, the
16 CNWS property is in the process of being converted to civilian use. This conversion includes the
17 City of Concord's planned construction on CNWS property of more than 12,200 housing units, 6.1
18 million square feet of commercial floor space, and a variety of community facilities.
19 4. The Concord Hills Project itself is a regional park intended to provide recreation
20 opportunities to the public while preserving the site's substantial sensitive biological resources,
21 protected wetlands, and cultural sites. The Concord Hills Project emphasizes preservation of its
22 unique biological resources, which require careful examination of the potential impacts of
23 development and public access, particularly given the site has not been open to the public for
24 many years.

25 5. Recreational, educational, and other public facilities of significant size and scope
26 will be constructed as part of the Concord Hills Project, including construction of an event center
27 and the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial Visitor Center.

28 6. The purpose of a CEQA environmental impact report "is to identify the significant

-

2 effects on the environment of a project," regardless of who the project proponent may be or the
ultimate purpose of the project. Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1(a). CEQA's requirements for
3 environmental review do not

4 vary. Agency decisions must be based on substantial evidence. Cal.
Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5 (agency abuses its discretion when its "determination or decision is not
5 supported by substantial evidence").

6 7. EBRPD's actions here fall short of well-established CEQA requirements: For
7  example, EBRPD fails to determine the biological resources currently present on-site or to
8 adequately analyze the Concord Hills Project's impacts on those resources. EBRPD also fails to

9 adequately analyze the reasonably foreseeable impacts of known project elements, establish the
10 environmental baseline, or accurately analyze greenhouse gas emissions. These glaring
11 deficiencies mandate invalidation.

12 8. EBRPD erroneously seeks to use the programmatic characterization to avoid
13 | environmental review of elements of the Concord Hills Project that are actually known now or
14 reasonably foreseeable now, despite CEQA's clear mandate that "tiering" cannot excuse lesser
15  environmental review in the first instance. When preparing a programmatic EIR, "[t]he fact more
16 precise information may be available during the next tier of environmental review does not excuse
17 [an agency] from providing what information it reasonably can now." Cleveland Nat'l Forest
18 Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts, 17 Cal. App. 5th 413, 440 (2017).

19 9. Petitioners conveyed its concerns during the administrative process, to which
20 EBRPD failed to adequately respond. All potentially significant impacts should have been

21 identified and mitigated "in the environmental review process." Cal. Pub. Res. Code §
22 21003.1(a). EBRPD has not done so here.:

23 10. The Concord Hills Project may only proceed with a valid FEIR that fulfills all
24 applicable requirements under California law. Due to the serious inadequacies and errors in the
25 Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR"), the FEIR here falls far short of that mandate.
26 Accordingly, EBRPD's certification of the FEIR was an abuse of discretion that must be vacated.

17. Venue is appropriate in this Court pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
2 Sections 392(a), 393, 394 and 395 because the real property at issue in the litigation is located in
3 this County, Petitioners are headquartered in this County, the causes of action arose in this
4 County, and EBRPD operates in this County.

5 STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

6 18. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in EBRPD's full and
7 complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in granting discretionary
8 approvals for the Concord Hills Project.

.19. EBRPD owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authority
10° under CEQA before exercising its discretion to approve the Concord Hills Project and certify the
11 FEIR.

12 20. Petitioners are currently developing and planning to develop residential
13  development projects in the vicinity of the Concord Hills Project, including the proposed Faria
14 development project immediately adjacent to the Concord Hills Project, as well as other projects
15 in Concord and Pittsburg. Petitioners have an important interest in ensuring that all of the
16 environmental impacts of the Concord Hills Project are identified and fully mitigated, including
17 environmental impacts that may or could affect Petitioners' nearby development projects, land
18 holdings, and commercial office buildings.

19 21. Petitioners also have public interest standing to enforce the laws violated by
20 EBRPD, including CEQA.

21 22.. During the administrative review process, Petitioners submitted written comments
22 to the Board on May 29, 2020, and on July 6, 2020, which objected to certification of the FEIR.
23 and which detailed the inadequacy of EBRPD's environmental review pursuant to CEQA. Those
24 comments included technical memoranda from three environmental consultants providing further
25 technical analysis of the deficiencies in EBRPD's environmental review documents.

26 23. In addition to Petitioners, local agencies, organizations, and individuals submitted
27 comments identifying various flaws and insufficiencies in the DEIR and FEIR. Petitioners are
28 entitled to challenge EBRPD's actions on the basis of these objections by other commenters. See

7 and will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this Petition.
NOTICE OF LAWSUIT

26. On July 29, 2020, in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.5,
10 Petitioners sent by overnight delivery a letter to EBRPD, the Board, and the Clerk of the Board,
11 giving notice to EBRPD of Petitioners' intent to file this Petition and commence this action. A
12 copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.

13 27. In accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, a copy of this pleading
14 will be provided to the Attorney General.

15 PREPARATION OF THE RECORD

16 28. Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6, Petitioners request that
17 Respondents prepare the record.
18° GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

19| Concord Hills Regional Park LUP And FEIR Approval Process

20 29. The Concord Naval Weapons Station was an operating military base from World

21 War II through 1999. In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced that the
22 Inland Area of the CNWS property was approved for closure and conversion to civilian use, with
23 the Tidal Area remaining in operation as a port under the command of the Army.

24 30. In 2006, the City of Concord ("City") launched a multi-year process to prepare a

25 Reuse Plan for the approximately 5,000 acres comprising the Inland Area of CNWS, which
26 includes the proposed Concord Hills Project. Acting as Local Reuse Authority ("LRA"), the City
27 prepared the Concord Community Reuse Plan and associated EIR, which was finalized in 2010,
28 and the Concord Reuse Project Area Plan, which was adopted in 2012 and incorporated into the-

City's General Plan.

2 31. The City plans to develop the western portion of the Inland Area of the CNWS

3 property, immediately adjacent to the Concord Hills Project. The City envisions development of

4 over 12,200 new housing units, over 6.1 million square feet of commercial floor space, and a
5 | variety of community facilities. The City is currently preparing a Concord Reuse Project Specific
6 Plan for this western portion, for which a Notice of Preparation was issued in November 2018.

7 32. The Concord Hills Project site ("Concord Hills Project Site") comprises the eastern
8 portion of the Inland Area, and totals 2,543 acres. In 2013, EBRPD applied for a public benefit

9 transfer of the Concord Hills Project Site, which was approved by the National Park Service in
10 2014. On July 2, 2019, the Board authorized EBRPD's acceptance of most of the Concord Hills
11 Project Site.'

12 33. According to EBRPD, Concord Hills Project development will include substantial
13 | construction, including staging facilities, parking lots, campgrounds, picnic areas, a park
14 residence, a visitor center complex, an event center, and other recreational, educational, and
15 interpretive facilities, in addition to the development of trails for walking, hiking, biking, and
16| horseback riding. •DEIR, p. 3-15.2 Development is planned to occur in three phases over many
17 /years. Throughout the planning process, EBRPD emphasized that a primary purpose of the
18 Concord Hills Project is to create a conservation area that preserves the Concord Hills Project
19 Site's natural and cultural resources. DEIR, p. 1-5.

20° 34. Following a handful of public meetings, EBRPD published a Notice of Preparation
21 of an Environmental Impact Report ("NOP") on June 23, 2017. The NOP stated that "[t]he EIR"
22 will include a discussion of the existing conditions for each environmental issue and identify
23 short-term and long-term environmental impacts associated with the project, and their levels of
24 || significance." The NOP did not state that EBRPD would be preparing a program EIR.

25 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that while the Board authorized
26 acceptance, the Concord Hills Project Site is in the process of being formally transferred to EBRPD and title remains with the Navy.
27 The FEIR certified by EBRPD incorporated the DEIR in full. Specific portions of the two 28 | documents will be cited individually herein.

4415, 954-4400 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 35. On October 18, 2019, EBRPD posted the Notice of Availability of the DEIR for the
2 Concord Hills Regional Park Land Use Plan ("LUP"), and posted the LUP and the DEIR.

3 36. The LUP is described as "a long-term plan for the management and operations of a

4 new Regional Park that has been prepared by the East Bay Regional Park District" (DEIR, p. 3-1)

5 that will "guide the development and management of Concord Hills Regional Park over a period
6 of fifty years, with consideration to the site's natural and cultural resources, recreational and
7 educational opportunities, and relationship to the Concord Reuse project." LUP, p. 7.

8 37. EBRPD prepared a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR"), which it released
to the public on May 1,2020. The FEIR incorporated the DEIR in full, other than a small number a
10 of revisions and additions. The FEIR did not address or remedy the numerous deficiencies
11 contained in the DEIR.

12 38. On May 7, 2020, the EBRPD Board Executive Committee voted to approve the
13 LUP and FEIR. On May 18, 2020, the EBRPD Park Advisory Committee voted to approve the
14 LUP and FEIR. The LUP and FEIR were then scheduled to be adopted and certified, respectively,
15 at the June 2, 2020 meeting of the Board.

16 39. On-May 29, 2020, in advance of the June 2 Board meeting, Petitioners submitted a

17 comment letter (*May 29 Comments") addressing the serious flaws and deficiencies of the DEIR

18 and asserting that CEQA required the preparation and circulation of a new DEIR before it could be

19 certified by the Board. The May 29 Comments included a technical comment letter prepared by
20 consultants RCH Group (RCH Letter") containing further examination of how the DEIR failed to
21 adequately analyze the Concord Hills Project's environmental impacts. In compliance with the
22 instructions for public comment provided by EBRPD in the official agenda for the meeting, the
23 May 29 Comments and RCH Letter were timely submitted to the Board, General Manager, and
24 Clerk of the Board.

25 40. During the Board's June 2, 2020 meeting, the Board decided to remove
26 consideration of the LUP and FEIR from the agenda in light of Petitioners' May 29 Comments.

27 EBRPD counsel Carol Victor stated that it would be prudent to review the May 29 Comments and
28 to reschedule Board consideration to a future Board meeting.

41. On Thursday, July 2, 2020, EBRPD posted the agenda for the July 7, 2020 meeting
2 of the Board. Adoption of the LUP and certification of the FEIR was included on that agenda for

3 the July 7 meeting.

4 42. On Saturday, July 5, 2020, EBRPD posted the staff reports and agenda packet for

5 the July 7 meeting, which included a memorandum purporting to respond to the contentions of the

6 May 29 Comments as well as an errata making brief corrections to the FEIR and DEIR. The

7 memorandum and errata also referenced a comment letter submitted by the California Native Plant

8 Society, in which the California Native Plant Society stated that "[s]urveys conducted by Vollmar
and HT Harvey consulting were conducted in 2008 and 2010 (12 and 10 years ago respectively)
10 and are insufficient to be used as representative floristic surveys of the project area." EBRPD
11 June 24, 2020 Memorandum (**Memorandum"), Attachment B, p. 2.

12 43. On Monday, July 6, 2020, following receipt of the agenda for the July 7 Board
13 meeting, Petitioners submitted to the Board an additional comment letter ("Tuly 6 Comments")
14 focusing on the DEIR's failure to uphold CEQA standards in the areas of biological resources, air
15 quality, and greenhouse gas emissions, and incorporating by reference the May 29 Comments.
16 The July 6 Comments included technical comment letters from two consultants, Moore Biological
17| Consultants ("Moore Letter") and Ramboll ("Ramboll Letter"), detailing inadequacies of the

18 environmental review.

19 44. During the Board meeting on Tuesday, July 7, 2020, the Board addressed the
20 comments submitted in the May 29 Comments and July 6 Comments. Notwithstanding those
21 comments and following discussion, the Board voted to adopt the LUP and certify the FEIR at the

22 July 7 meeting.

23 45. On July 13, 2020, the State Clearinghouse within the Office of Planning &
24 Research posted the Notice of Determination for the Concord Hills Project on California's CEQA
25  clearinghouse webpage, CEQAnet. On July 14, 2020, Contra Costa County posted the NOD on its
26 CEQA filings webpage. This lawsuit is timely filed within thirty (30) days of the NOD posting.
27 Environmental Impact Report
28 46. The EIR is widely recognized as the "heart of CEQA." Schellinger Bros. v. City of

1 Sebastopol, 179 Cal. App. 4th 1245, 1257 (2009). CEQA provides that "[a]n EIR should be

2 prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which

3 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
consequences." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15151. CEQA requires that an EIR address all of a
Iproject's significant environmental effects, including direct, indirect, and long-term effects.

6 Public Resources Code § 21100(b); 14 Cal Code Regs. § 15126.2(a).

7 47. Agency conclusions, findings, and determinations must be supported by substantial

8 evidence. Residents Against Specific Plan 380 v. Cty. of Riverside, 9 Cal. App. 5th 941, 968
9 (2017). Otherwise, they are deemed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, mandating rejection of the
10 EIR. See Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40-Cal.

11 4th 412, 426 (2007).

12 48. Here, the DEIR lacks the analytical rigor and evidentiary support required to meet
13 CEQA's well-established standards. The DEIR fails to sufficiently disclose and analyze impacts
14 to biological resources and greenhouse gas emissions, fails to adequately establish the
15 environmental baseline, and improperly defers mitigation measures. Moreover, the DEIR
16 improperly uses the Program EIR label to defer analysis of known and reasonably foreseeable
17 environmental impacts of the Concord Hills Project. Accordingly, EBRPD's decision to certify
18 the FEIR was not based on substantial evidence and constitutes an abuse of discretion. Cal. Pub.
19 Res. Code § 21168.5.
20 Biological Resources

21 49. Biological resources is a required category of analysis under CEQA and a critical
22 component of any EIR. An analysis of potential impacts of the Concord Hills Project on

23 biological resources is particularly important for this project, given the Concord Hills Project Site
24 contains habitat for an array of unique species and is not otherwise open to the public.

25 50. The DEIR does not analyze current conditions, and thus inadequately and
26 inaccurately analyzes the potentially significant impacts on biological resources at the Concord
27 Hills Project Site. Severely outdated biological data is cited and relied upon, with most of the data
28 collected 10 to 20 years ago, As such, its conclusion of no significant impacts on biological

resources is speculative, unfounded, flawed, and legally deficient.

51. . The DEIR cites to and relies upon a Biological Opinion completed in 2017 and
prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS") for the Navy and United States Army
Corps of Engineers ("USACE") for the proposed transfer and redevelopment of CNWS. The
5 Biological Opinion concluded that the potential Concord Hills Project would have significant

6 impacts on special-status species and biological resources, including "adverse effects of

7 development and recreation . . . on Central California tiger salamanders, California red-legged
8 frogs, and Alameda whipsnakes." Biological Opinion,' p: 63-64. The Biological Opinion was
prepared pursuant to the agencies' obligations under the federal Endangered Species Act, 16
10 U.S.C. 1531, et seq., and is not a substitute for CEQA analysis of biological resources.

11 52. The most recent field surveys described and relied upon in the LUP, DEIR, FEIR,
12 and Biological Resources Report' are from 2011, and are therefore outdated and do not depict
13 | current conditions. These field surveys include larval surveys for California tiger salamander, a
14 threatened species under state and federal law." In addition to being outdated, the larval surveys
15 were conducted within only : limited area, and are not representative of conditions throughout the
16 Concord Hills Project Site.

17 53. The DEIR also cites and relies upon an outdated delineation of wetlands and other
18 waters on the Concord Hills Project Site. The last documented verified delineation by the USACE
19  was in 2011.°

22 Costa County, California (May 30, 2017).

23 Included as Appendix B-3 to the LUP is the Concord Hills Regional Park Biological Resources Existing Conditions Report, referred to herein as the "Biological Resources Report."
24 5 The DEIR incorrectly identifies the California tiger salamander as an endangered species under
25 state law (DEIR, p. 4.3-29), further demonstrating the DEIR's inaccuracies with regard to biological resources. While certain sub-populations are listed as endangered under federal law, 26 the species as a whole is listed as threatened under both state and federal law. State and Federally Listed Endangered and Threatened Animals of California, July 17, 2020, California Department 27 of Fish and Wildlife.

54. Similarly, the remaining technical studies described in the Biological Resources
2 Report were conducted in 2008 or earlier. In describing reptiles and mammals potentially
3 occurring at the Concord Hills. Project Site, the DEIR cites wildlife surveys performed as far back

4 as 1999 - 21 years ago. DEIR, p. 4.3-18, fn. 15.

5 55. The most recent protocol-level survey cited in the Biological Resources Report for
6 the California red-legged frog, a threatened species under federal law and species of special
7 concern under state law, occurred fifteen years ago in 2005. The most recent survey in 2009 was a

8 mere "check of the Cistern Pond." Biologícal Resources Report, p. A-4.

9 56. Similarly, the Biological Resources Report indicates that protocol-level surveys for
10 listed vernal pool branchiopods, such as fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp, were last conducted in.
11 2007 and 2008. Biological Resources Report, Table 3. These surveys are far too outdated to

12 support the determination of "Absent" in describing the potential for occurrence at the Concord
13 Hills Project Site. DEIR, p. 4.3-28. For example, during the last 12 to 13 years since these
14 surveys were performed, these species could have been introduced to on-site wetlands by

15 waterfowl.

16 57. The most recent protocol-level surveys for special-status plants were conducted
17 twelve years ago in 2008 - with additional surveys of indeterminate scope in 2009. Biological
18 Resources Report, p. 5.

19 58. EBRPD staff contend the site has been "surveyed or visited by biologists annually
20 for the last 10-plus years" and that the site remains "stable and accurate with regard to types of
21 habitat and species occurring."7 However, no such current surveys or analysis are in the
22 Biological Opinion or the DEIR, and no documentation or other evidence is provided or disclosed
23  by EBRPD to substantiate this contention. This is not substantial evidence.

24 provided no independent and documented verification to establish that it remains valid after nine 25 years.
26 During the July 7 Board meeting, District staff displayed a slide show presentation containing
these statements.
27 The biological survey data relied upon in the Biological Opinion is similarly outdated. In 28 addition, the Biological Opinion refers to "trapping" of California tiger salamanders during and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

59. The DEIR's lack of current surveys, and its citation and reliance on outdated
2 biological data, means that its conclusions regarding potential impacts are inaccurate, and further

3 confirms an absence of substantial evidence to establish such a conclusion as of the present day,
given it has been more than a decade since the last documented surveys of biological resources.
5 For example, the DEIR contends the Concord Hills Project "would not interfere substantially with
6 the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established
7 native resident or migratory wildlife corridors or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites"
8 and, based on that contention, the DEIR concludes that no mitigation is needed for this particular
9| biological resources impact. DEIR, p. 4.3-58-61. That contention is not accurate, credible or
10 well-founded given the absence of current biological data to support it.
11 60. EBRPD asserts that it need not comply with these obligations under CEQA on the
12 grounds that the majority of the Concord Hills Project Sitè will be an undeveloped protected
13 conservation area. Not true - EBRPD is not entitled to perform a less intensive review, and is. not a
14 relieved from its obligations pursuant to CEQA. The Concord Hills Project's goals of preserving
15 threatened species and serving as a "biological hotspot"? reinforce the importance of accurately
16 evaluating the Concord Hills Project's potential impacts on these biological resources.

17 61. The indisputable fact remains that the Concord Hills Project, as planned, will entail
18 substantial impacts to biological habitat and direct impacts on species throughout the Concord
19 Hills Project Site. Those impacts will range from the construction of buildings to the use of trails
20 throughout the entire site by hikers, bikers, and their pets. Proposed facilities are planned within
21  areas desiguated as preserved for conservation. DEIR, Figure 3-7.

22 62. The Biological Opinion itself identifies expected direct and indirect impacts on
23 sensitive species: "[t]he increased presence of people and dogs in the Mt. Diablo Riparian
24 Corridor and the [Concord Hills Project] Area may affect Central California tiger salamanders and

25 possibly prior to 2016. However, it does not specify the frequency and scope of this trapping, 26 which was only performed at a single pond and thus provides little information about the entirety of the Concord Hills Project Site and no information whatsoever about the movement of the 27 California tiger salamander or other species.

1 California red-legged frogs by trampling habitat and disturbing individual animals . . . [D]ogs
2 accompanying recreationists could kill or injure Central California tiger salamanders or California
3 red-legged frogs." Biological Opinion, p. 59-60.

4 63. The DEIR does not address the current location of these sensitive species or their
current habitats, given its reliance upon outdated surveys. Nor does it address their mobility - the
6 EBRPD's proposed "buffer" between trails and breeding habitat disregards and does not address
7 that visitors and sensitive species like the California red-legged frog will move and disperse
8 around the site. The location of numerous Concord Hills Project features and facilities could
easily impact the threatened California tiger salamander and threatened California red-legged frog

10 both of which are known to potentially migrate significant distances. Breeding grounds change,
11 habitats change and their ranges increase or decrease.

12 64. By essentially ignoring the near-certainty of intersections between visitors and
13 sensitive species, the DEIR fails to adequately address the potentially significant impacts on
14 biological resources. Yet the administrative record does not reflect any analysis of patterns of
15. species distribution over time.

16 65. Moreover, the relied upon prior survey data largely focus on breeding sites, and
17. thus give only a small snäpshot of conditions at the Concord Hills Project Site, without
18 information on movement patterns or areas used for aestivation. Without current data on where
19 these sensitive species may be located, or may travel to and from, the proposed 22 miles of trails
20 and other recreational uses cannot be accurately planned to identify which of them may present an
21 impact to these sensitive species which travel overland.

22 66. As such, a CEQA-compliant environmental review requires recent information
23 disclosing current locations of these biological resources - not their locations ten to twenty years

24 ago. Due to the DEIR's failure to provide current and accurate biological data, EBRPD cannot
25 determine the Concord Hills Project's potential impacts on biological resources.

26 67. The threatened California tiger salamander and threatened California red-legged

27 frog are vulnerable to harm by visitors as they migrate within the Concord Hills Project Site,
28 including across trails, roads, and other such areas. The possibility of harm to the threatened

P California tiger salamander warrants obtaining a Section 2081 Authorization for incidental take

2 from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"). There is no indication, however,
3 that one has been obtained.

4 68. The DEIR cites a Long Term Management Plan ("LTMP") for management of
5 special-status plant species. The LTMP is not provided is or substantially described in the DEIR,
6 however, as it is required to be. Neither was it made available and accessible to the public. Its
7 location and contents remain a mystery.

8 69. The absence of public disclosure of the LTMP is unacceptable under CEQA..
9 Documents relied upon in an EIR must be attached or otherwise "available and accessible." See
10 Trout Unlimited v. Morton, 509 F.2d 1276, 1284 (9th Cir. 1974). The LTMP should have been
11 incorporated as an appendix, or otherwise made available and accessible. EBRPD's failure to do
12 SO négates "[t]he purpose of an EIR ... to give the public and government agencies the
13 information needed to make informed decisions." In re Bay-Delta Programmatic Envtl. Impact
14 Report Coordinated Proceedings, 43 Cal. 4th 1143, 1162 (2008).

15 70. Indeed, the LTMP is important enough that, even if EBRPD staff had belatedly
16 made it available for public review, it would constitute "significant new information" and EBRPD
17 would be required to recirculate the DEIR. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.5(a).

18 71. The DEIR does not contain substantial evidence to support its conclusion that
19 impacts to biological resources will be less than significant. EBRPD's decision to adopt the LUP
20 and certify the FEIR was an abuse of discretion.
21  Environmental Baseline

22 72. Every EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in
23 the vicinity of the project, referred to as the environmental "baseline." 14 Cal. Code Regs. §
24  15125. Definition of the baseline is an essential element of CEQA review to evaluate a project's
25 impact. The EIR "must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining
26 a 'baseline' against. which predicted effects can be described and quantified." Neighbors for
v. 27 Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Constr. Auth., 57 Cal. 4th 439, 447 (2013). Otherwise,

2 environmental impacts of the development project." Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego y.
3 Ass'n of Gov'ts, 17 Cal. App. 5th 413, 439-40 (2017).

4 •73, Here, the DEIR was required by CEQA to adequately describe the environmental
5 baseline as of June 2017, which is when the NOP was published. 14 Cal. Code Regs. §

6 15125(a)(1). The DEIR fails to adequately describe the environmental baseline, particularly with
7 regard to biological resources and noise. As described above, the majority of the biological
8 inventory derives from surveys taken more than a decade ago, and cannot serve as the baseline for
9 an NOP published in June 2017.

10 74. The basic purpose of the environmental baseline, which EBRPD ignores, is to
11 establish the environmental conditions at the time the DEIR is prepared,10 While the inclusion of
12 older data in the DEIR in addition to current data could potentially benefit environmental review,

13 it is not a substitute and does not obviate the requirement of current data to determine the baseline..
14 Nor is the inclusion of outdated data, without any extrapolation of that data over time, substantial
15 evidence of current conditions. While having a long term biological data set does allow for
16 analysis of patterns of species distribution over time, given the absence of such analysis in the
17 DEIR or FEIR, that was not done here.

18. 75. Similarly, the DEIR does not indicate that an acoustical study was performed, or
.19 that any noise measurements were taken in order to determine existing ambient noise levels at the
20 Concord Hills Project Site. The DEIR includes a brief qualitative discussion of existing noise
21 conditions, but no quantitative analysis of the baseline is included. DEIR p. 4.11-10. By contrast,
22 the DEIR's discussion of local noise regulations indicates that the applicable standards rely on
23 quantification of noise sources in terms of decibel levels. DEIR, p. 4.11-18; DEIR, Table 4.11-4.
24 Accordingly, the failure to quantify existing noise levels through acoustical studies effectively

25 ignores the established method by which the local regulatory scheme would determine the baseline

26

27 10 EBRPD contends that it has relied on four decades of surveys (Memorandum, p. 11), but, as 28 described herein, the surveys span only the three decades from 1982 to 2011.

of existing noise levels, and was an abuse of EBRPD's discretion. Without quantification of

2 existing noise levels, the DEIR has not adequately defined existing environmental conditions for
3| purposes of setting a baseline, and therefore cannot meaningfully measure future noise impacts.
14 Cal. Code Regs. § 1525(a) (explaining that the description of the environmental setting
5 "constitute[s] the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an
6 impact is significant").

76. In sum, the DEIR fails to provide substantial evidence to establish the
8 I environmental baseline for biological resources and noise impacts, thus fatally undermining its
9 analysis of these areas. Citizens for E. Shore Parks v. State Lands Comm'n, 202 Cal. App. 4th

10 549, 557 (2011) (*[A]n inappropriate baseline may skew the environmental analysis flowing from

11 it, resulting in an EIR that fails to comply with CEQA.").
12| Greenhouse Gas Emissions

13 77. The DEIR concludes that the Concord Hills Project will not have a significant
14 impact on the environment in the area of greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") during operation. To
15 reach this conclusion, the DEIR cites two separate GHG thresholds of significance - a mass

16 emissions threshold and an efficiency metric threshold. Due to errors in the DEIR, however, both
17 thresholds fail to provide substantial evidence for the DEIR's conclusion that the Concord Hills
18 Project's impacts are less than significant.

19 78. Application of the mass emissions threshold involves calculating the expected total
20 mass of GHG emissions produced by the Concord Hills Project, and comparing this figure with

21 the applicable threshold. The DEIR's mass emissions threshold reflects a de minimis threshold of

22 1,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (MTC02e/yr.) recommended by the Bay
23 Area Air Quality Management District (*"BAAQMD"). BAAQMD derived this threshold through
24 an analysis that specifically evaluated consistency with California's GHG target for 2020. The
25 DEIR shows a GHG level of 131 MTC02e/yr. for the Concord Hills Project in 2023, which is
26 below the 1,100 MTCO2e/yr. threshold.

27 79. However, the DEIR erroneously fails to adjust this threshold (again, based upon
28 California's GHG target for 2020) for its projection for year 2050. DEIR, Table 4.7-5, p. 4.7-23.

Forella Braw+ Manel LLP 233 Mongouery Strect. 17 Flc San Fmacisce, California 94104 17 34978\13531297.5
151 954-4400 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

The State of California will have : dramatically reduced 2050 GHG target - far less than the 2020
2 GHG target that is the basis for the current threshold. Thus BAAQMD's mass emissions
3 threshold will be significantly lower for year 2050.

4 80. BAAQMD's GHG thresholds did not evaluate longer-term GHG targets including
5 California's adopted 2030 target set through SB 32. The DEIR requires, but does not contain,
6 justification for the use of a threshold outside the context for which it was adopted, particularly
7 given the Concord Hills Project's projected 2050 emissions will exceed even a slightly lower mass
8 emissions threshold. As such, the DEIR fails to provide substantial evidence that the Concord

9 Hills Project's GHG impacts will be less than significant.

10 81. The DEIR also describes an efficiency metric threshold, which calculates GHG
11 emissions per "service population" in terms of MTCO2e per service population per year
12 (MTCO2e/SP/yr.). There are a number of problems with the DEIR's efficiency metric thresholds.
13 First, the efficiency metric thresholds are internally inconsistent. According to Table 4.7-5 of the
14 DEIR, the Concord Hills Project's 2023 GHG emissions of 0.34 MTC02e/SP/yr. are well below
15 the applicable threshold of 6.56 MTCO2e/SP/yr., and its 2050 GHG emissions of 0.64 are below
16 the applicable threshold of 1.22 MTCO2e/SP/yr. DEIR, Table 4.7-5, p. 4.7-23. However, Table
17 4.7-4 shows an efficiency metric of 3.1 MTCO2e/SP for the years 2030 and 2050 - the DEIR does
18 not explain this disparity.

19 82. The DEIR fails to explain how it derived the efficiency metric thresholds which it
20 applied. The thresholds utilized in Table 4.7-5 are much higher than would be expected using a
21 trajectory from BAAQMD's 2020 threshold to the 2030 threshold used in Table 4.7-4, and appear

22 to have been derived using an undisclosed methodology. Accordingly the DEIR's basis for these
23 calculations, upon which it relies for its conclusions regarding GHG impacts, is not supported by
24 substantial evidence.

25 83. The DEIR's efficiency metric thresholds are also significantly flawed because they
26 improperly include Concord Hills Project visitors as part of the service population, thus drastically
27  reducing the GHG level as measured by MTCO2e/SP/yr. For purposes of this analysis, the service
28 population is limited to "residents and employees who live or work within the project site."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

HA DEIR, p. 4.7-22, fn..32. Accordingly, per the May 2017 BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, the
2 service population should be calculated by "adding the number of residents to the number of jobs
3 estimated for a given point in time." BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, May 2017, p. 9-5. Visitors to
4 the Concord Hills Project should have been excluded from these service population calculations,
5 I.not included.

6 84. The outcome significantly changes when these values are correctly calculated with
7 only employees, and excluding visitors. The correct metric for 2023 is a measurement of a

8 approximately 16.38 MTCO2e/SP/yr., and the metric for 2050 is a measurement of approximately

9 19.40 MTCO2e/SP/yr., both of which greatly exceed the applicable thresholds in the DEIR. The
10 DEIR's erroneous service population dramatically altered the outcome of its GHG calculations.

11 The DEIR does not address or explain its erroneous application of service population contrary to
12 the definition in the BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines, as cited within the DEIR.

13 85. These errors in the GHG threshold calculations reveal that the DEIR's conclusions

14 with regard to GHG impacts are not based on substantial evidence. EBRPD's decision to adopt
15 the LUP and certify the FEIR was an abuse of discretioni.
16 Improper Reliance on Regulatory Compliance to Mitigate Storm Water Impacts

17° 86. A critical component of any EIR are the mitigation measures that will negate or
18 substantially reduce the potentially significant impacts of the project. Cal. Pub. Res. Code
19 21002.

20 87. With regard to the potentially significant effects of storm water runoff, the DEIR
21  states the mitigation is to incorporate regulatory requirements and standards into project design.
22 The DEIR fails, however, to provide supporting analyses to demonstrate that adherence to
23 regulatory requirements incorporated into Mitigation Measures HYD-1.1 and HYD-1.2 ensure
24 | impacts under CEQA will be, and will remain, less than siguificant. While revised Mitigation
25 Measure HYD-1.2 states that EBRPD will prepare a Stormwater Control Plan, EBRPD should
26 have at least prepared a preliminary Stormwater Control Plan demonstrating how it implements
27 the requirements of the Contra Costa Clean Water Program Stormwater C.3 Guidebook. Because
28 the DEIR indicates that the total acreage and location of impervious surfaces planned for the

1 Concord Hills Project Site are known (DEIR, p. 4.9-18), EBRPD has not adequately explained
2 why it chose not to prepare a preliminary Stormwater Control Plan at this stage. Furthermore,
3 nowhere does the DEIR* provide additional analysis or assessment of storm water runoff rates,

4 design, or engineering feasibility to achieve regulatory standards. The DEIR could have, and did

5 not, calculate worst-case site-specific storm water volumes and rates based upon conservative
6 assumptions of project build-out, and then detail a conceptual storm water management system
7 design with appropriate sizing and location, from which an assessment of impacts related to
8 hydromodification and flooding could be presented with defensible mitigation strategies disclosed.
9 None of this was performed.

10 88. As discussed in the RCH Letter, and also by the Contra Costa County Flood
11 Control and Water Conservation District ("FCWCD") in its public comments, the DEIR fails to
12 sufficiently discuss flooding along the downstream segment of Mt. Diablo Creek, which is already
13 subject to periodic flooding under existing conditions. The DEIR also fails to adequately analyze
14 the impacts of increased runoff from future development of the Concord Hills Project on the
15| existing drainage facilities in the downstream areas, including those areas outside of the Concord
16 Hills Project Site where the downstream drainage system is inadequate. EBRPD's inadequate
17 responses to these concerns include the statement that "the area that may be subject to some new
18 development and impervious surfaces is very small - about 16.5 acres - and is not immediately
19 adjacent to any local water bodies." Memorandum, p. 10. In reality 16.5 acres a is a large area, not

20 a small area, and in any event the size of the impervious area is not a substitute for a quantitative
21 analysis of the Concord Hills Project's storm water impacts. In light of these potentially
22 significant impacts identified by Petitioners and FCWCD, EBRPD's bare assumption that
23 regulatory compliance will provide sufficient mitigation is not supported by substantial evidence
24 and does not comply with CEQA, which requires that "the discussion of the mitigation measures
25 must contain facts and analysis, not bare conclusions and opinions." Golden Door Properties,
26| LLC v. Cty. of San Diego, 50 Cal. App. 5th 467, 2020 WL 3119041, * 42 (2020).

27 89. In these circumstances, an agency is precluded from simply citing "regulatory
28 compliance" as the mitigation measure. See Californians for Alts. to Toxics v. Dep't of Food &

Farella Brauq + Manel LLP 235 Monigomery Street. 17* Flcor Sas Francisca, California 94104 20 34978\13531297.5

Agric., 136 Cal. App. 4th 1, 17 (2005) ("Compliance with the law is not enough to is support a
2 finding of no significant impact under the CEQA.").

3 90. The DEIR lacks specific analysis of potentially significant impacts, and specific
4 analysis of the mitigating effects the asserted regulatory compliance would have, for purposes of
5 storm water runoff.

6 91. Accordingly, the DEIR has not provided substantial evidence to support its
7 conclusion that storm water impacts will be less than significant. EBRPD's decision to adopt the
8 LUP and certify the FEIR constituted an abuse of discretion.

q Deferred Analysis Pursuant to Program EIR Label

10 92. CEQA provides that "[d]rafting an EIR necessarily involves some degree of
11 forecasting. While foreseeing the unforeseeable is not possible, an agency must use its best efforts
12 to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15144. A program EIR
13 may be used to simplify the task of preparing later environmental documents for activities within
14 the program as they are proposed for approval (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168(b)-(d)), but cannot be
15 used out of convenience to avoid full CEQA review of known or reasonably foreseeable Concord
16 Hills Project elements.

17 93. Here, the DEIR does not adequately analyze Concord Hills Project elements, and
18 hence enyironmental impacts, that are known or reasonably foreseeable at this time, even if
19 lacking in certain details. EBRPD's deferral of specific analysis is contrary to CEQA, which
20 expressly mandates that tiering must "not prevent adequate identification of significant effects of
21 the planning approval at hand." 14 Cal. Code § Regs. § 15152.
22 94. Unlike other program EIRs, in this case the lead agency for the DEIR is also the
23 lead agency and project proponent for all subsequent projects. This is not the typical situation for
24 a program EIR, which "evaluates the broad policy direction of a planning document, such as a
25 general plan, but does not examine the potential site-specific impacts of the many individual
26 projects that may be proposed in the future consistent with the plan." a Citizens for a Sustainable
27 Treasure Island v. City & Cty. of S.F., 227 Cal. App. 4th 1036, 1047 (2014) (emphasis added).

1  have not only already been proposed, but ate planned for development, with no guarantee of
2 further environmental review. For instance, development of the south of Bailey Road area will
3 begin soon, and the LUP indicates that this portion - the "Phase 1 Focus Area" - will be
4 completed within the next "0-10 years." LUP, p. 126. The DEIR's GHG analyses use 2023 as the
5 date of opening. DEIR, p. 4.7-22.

6 96. Certain project elements will be implemented even before development of the
7 Phase 1 Focus Area. Activities such as safety and security upgrades, restoration and enhancement
8 efforts, and naturalist-led tours are planned to occur while the Concord Hills Project Site remains

9 in its current land bank status. UP, p. 126. These activities - which may result in significant
10 environmental impacts that have not yet been analyzed - could occur at any time.

11 97. Likely, EBRPD will attempt to tier off this FEIR pursuant to Guidelines Section
12 15168 (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15168) without subsequently performing detailed project-specific
13 environmental review as required, thereby exploiting the very loophole that CEQA warns against.
14 See 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15152(b) ("Tiering does not excuse the lead agency from adequately
15 analyzing reasonably foreseeable significant environmental effects of the project and does not
16 justify deferring such analysis to a later tier EIR or negative declaration."). As such, additional
17 EIRs may not be prepared for the Phase 1-Focus Area, which will include significant development
18 projects that warrant the level of detailed environmental review contained in an ER, such as
19 roads, trails, staging areas, picnic areas, interpretation elements, a group campground, and
20 community orchard. LUP, p. 126.

21 98. Such circumstances have led courts to warn that "the later the environmental

22 review process begins, the more bureaucratic and financial momentum there is behind a proposed
23 | project, thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns that could be dealt
24 with more easily at an early stage of the project." L.A. Unified Sch. Dist. V. City of L.A., 58 Cal.
25 App. 4th 1019, 1027 (1997). As here, courts caution that "[t]his problem may be exacerbated
26 where . . . the public agency prepares and approves the EIR for its own project." Id. at 1027-28.

27 99. EBRPD has sufficiently planned for these subsequent projects to provide maps and
28| descriptions of them, is both the lead agency and the project proponent, and intends to begin their

development soon. As such, the DEIR cannot defer substantive project-specific analysis, as it

2 seeks to do, and EBRPD fails to provide substantial evidence to support its decision not to further
3 analyze these aspects of the Concord Hills Project. Simply labeling the DEIR a "program EIR,"
4 without more, does not reduce or excuse EBRPD's obligation under CEQA to perform full
5 environmental analysis of reasonably foreseeable Concord Hills Project impacts. Cleveland Nat'l
6 Forest Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts, 17 Cal. App. 5th 413, 426 (2017) ("[D]esignating an
EIR as a program EIR does not by itself decrease the level of analysis otherwise required in the

8 EIR. ").

9 100. EBRPD has abused its discretion by deferring environmental analysis of reasonably
10 foreseeable potentially significant effects of the Concord Hills Project. See 14 Cal. Code Regs. §

11 15152(b).
12 Recirculation of DEIR Required

13 101. Under CEQA, "[a] lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant
14 new information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR.

15 before certification." '14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.5(a); see also Cal. Pub. Res. Code §
16 21092.1.Such circumstances exist when, for instance, "[t]he draft EIR was so fundamentally and
17 basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were
18 precluded." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.5(a)(4).

19 102. As described herein, the flaws of the current DEIR are so severe as to render it
20 fundamentally inadequate under CEQA. EBRPD was required to have withdrawn the DEIR and

21 to have prepared and recirculated a new DEIR to correct those deficiencies.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (CEQA Violations - Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)

24 103. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
25 contained in paragraphs 1 through 102 of this Petition.

26 104. The record demonstrates the DEIR fails to provide substantial evidence for its
27 conclusion that the Concord Hills Project will not have significant effects on the environment.

28 105. Specifically, the DEIR fails to fulfill CEQA requirements with regard to its analysis

Far ella Bratat - Manel LLP 235 Monigonery Stremt. 17" Floor San Francisca California 94104 23 34978\3531297.5

- of biological resources and greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation of storm water impacts, and
2 establishment of the environmental baseline. Furthermore, the DEIR. defers analysis of known and
3 reasonably foreseeable impacts based on an improper reliance on its programmatic label.

4 106. As a result of its many deficiencies, the DEIR violates CEQA by "omit[ting]
5 material necessary to informed decisionmaking and informed public participation." Cty. of
6 Amador v. El Dorado Cty, Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 946 (1999). Accordingly,
7 EBRPD erred in certifying the Concord Hills Project as fully compliant with CEQA. 14 Cal.
8| Code § Regs. § 15090(a)(1).

107. Because EBRPD's decision to cortify the FEIR was not supported by substantial
10 evidence, the decision constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion and must be vacated. Cal. Pub.
11 Res. Code § 21168.5.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Declaratory Relief)

14 108. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
15 contained in paragraphs 1 through 107 of this Petition.

16 109. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioners and EBRPD,
17| in that Petitioners contend, and are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that EBRPD
18 denies that it has failed to comply with CEQA, all as set forth in more detail above.
19 110. It is necessary and appropriate at this time that the Court issue a declaratory
20 judgment so that all parties hereto and the public as a whole may know the illegality or the legality
21 of the actions of EBRPD, as set forth in more detail above.

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Action
Concord Hills Regional Park

Dear General Manager Doyle, Board of Directors, and Clerk of the Board:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, that. Petitioners/Plaintiffs Discovery Builders, Inc. and Faria Land Investors, LLC intend to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Cal. Public Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., Title 14, §§ 15000, et seq.) against the East Bay Regional Park District and its Board of Directors (collectively "District") challenging adoption of the Concord Hills Regional Park Land Use Plan ("LUP") and certification of the accompanying Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR"), on the ground the environmental review did not satisfy CEQA's standards for analysis of potential environmental impacts or provide the requisite substantial evidence for its determinations and conclusions, thus constituting a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Petition will seek to set aside the LUP and FEIR.
If you have any questions regarding the foregoing, please contact me through your
counsel.

Very truly yours
