ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff AERA ENERGY LLC ("Aera") hereby petitions this Court for a

2 writ of mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, or alternatively, section

3 1094.5, directed to Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF VENTURA and the COUNTY OF

4 VENTURA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (collectively, "County") and hereby brings the within

5 Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages. In support, Aera hereby alleges as follows:

6 NATURE OF THE CASE

7 1. Aera is a lessee of mineral rights in an active oil field located within the County

8 north of the City of Ventura. The field is identified by the California Geologic Energy

9 Management Division (CalGEM) as the Ventura Field. Aera is in the business of oil and gas

10 exploration, development and production. Aera and its predecessors-in-interest have engaged in

11 such activities in the County for more than a century. The County has greatly benefited from the

12 presence of the oil and gas industry, which has provided jobs and spurred economic activity and

13 development in the region.

14 2. Because the prudent development of California's energy resources is a matter of

15 statewide concern, the State of California has long assumed primary responsibility for regulating

16 all aspects of oil and gas operations within the State. The California Legislature has adopted

17 numerous statutes and regulations designed to maximize the wise development of oil and gas

18 resources, while preventing damage to life, health, property and natural resources. The State of

19 California, acting through CalGEM, oversees and regulates all aspects of oil and gas production

20 to ensure the safe recovery of energy resources in the State. Consistent with that authority, before

21 drilling, re-drilling, reworking, or abandoning any oil well, Aera or any other producer of oil and

22 gas resources in the State must first obtain written authorization from CalGEM to ensure that

23 production activities comply with State law.

24 3. Certain aspects of Aera's oil and gas operations are also regulated by Federal Law.

25 Specifically, provisions of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. §7401 et. seq.) regulate emissions

26 resulting from oil and gas activities. Similarly, provisions of the Clean Water Act (42 U.S.C.

27 §300h-4) regulate oil field activities involving the injection of water into the subsurface.

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
Los ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Enforcement and implementation of those provisions throughout the State of California have been

2 delegated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to CalGEM.

3 4. As detailed below, the County is now seeking to impinge upon and usurp State and

4 Federal regulation by requiring all oil and gas development within the County to comply with

5 new limitations set forth in the County's 2040 General Plan, to be implemented through changes

6 to the County's zoning ordinances. These limitations would unlawfully impede Aera's existing

7 operations as well as its planned future operations. The provisions of the 2040 General Plan are

8 preempted by State and Federal law. They also impair Aera's vested right to continue

9 development and production of its leased oil and gas resources within the County and result in a

10 taking of Aera's property interests without just compensation.

11 5. Moreover, in its rush to prepare, consider and ultimately adopt the 2040 General

12 Plan, the County unlawfully failed to disclose, evaluate and ameliorate a multitude of

13 environmental consequences resulting from 2040 General Plan implementation.

14 6. Through this action, Aera challenges the County's adoption of the 2040 General

15 Plan and seeks a writ of mandate and declaratory relief against the County on grounds that, in

16 adopting and approving its 2040 General Plan, the County has adopted policies that are:

17 preempted by State and Federal law; an unconstitutional taking without just compensation;

18 violate Aera's vested right to continue development and production of its leased oil and gas

19 resources within the County, violate the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources
20 Code, §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA"), and abuse the County's discretion.

21 7. Aera requests that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Code of Civil

22 Procedure section 1085, or alternatively section 1094.5, directing the County to vacate and set

23 aside its approval of the 2040 General Plan and certification of its environmental impact report

24 relating to the same. Aera further requests injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent

25 implementation of the 2040 General Plan provisions set forth below, as well as damages for the

26 taking of its property in the event the provisions are upheld.

22 GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

23 A. Aera's Production of Oil and Gas in Ventura County

24 13.

25 For more than a century, oil and gas production has been a critical component of

26 the County's economy. The first commercially viable oil well in the County was drilled in

27 approximately 1916, and the expansion of oil production in the 1920's coincided with, and led to,
significant economic growth and development in the region.

28
MANATT, PHBLPS & 326878608.3
PHILLIPS, LLP
ATTORNEYS ATLAW - 4-

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 14. The Ventura Field - a long, narrow field located approximately three miles north

2 of the City of Ventura and extending approximately nine miles in an east-west direction - covers

3 more than 8,000 surface acres and has been the major source of oil and natural gas in the region

4 since the 1920s. It is currently the eleventh largest field in California, producing approximately

5 ten (10) thousand barrels of oil and six (6) million cubic feet of gas per day.

6 15. Aera and its predecessors-in-interest have been actively conducting oil and gas

7 development and production operations in the County since the early 1900s. Today, Aera is the

8 largest onshore oil and gas producer in the County, with oil and gas operations covering
approximately 4,300 acres in the Ventura Field. Aera's daily production activities involve nearly

10 one-hundred full-time employees and several hundred contractors and vendors, all working

11 within the County.

12 16. Aera's operations require the use of both production and water injection wells.

13 Production wells remove oil and gas resources from the field; injection wells flood produced

14 water into the geologic formations in which the oil and gas resources are located in order to

15 maintain the reservoir pressure within the geologic formation and continue to push the oil and gas

16 resources into the vicinity of the production wells. The oil and gas production process requires

17 constant drilling and re-drilling of both types of wells depending on the location of the oil and gas

18 within a geologic formation as well as the overall geology of the field. Re-drilling of a well is

19 often necessary to modify its depth to enable it to access a different portion of a reservoir. Aera

20 and its predecessors-in-interest have regularly drilled and re-drilled wells; over the years Aera has

21 drilled more than 1,900 wells in the Ventura Field and, in any given year, numerous wells are

22 drilled or re-drilled as part of Aera's routine field operations.

23 17. The County first promulgated regulations specifically relating to oil and gas

24 production in 1947. In March 1947, the County adopted Ventura County Ordinance No. 412,

25 which, for the first time, separated land uses, including oil and gas exploration, into different

26 categories and authorized such uses in specified areas within the County. Section 16(II)(B) of

27 County Ordinance No. 412 required issuance of a Special Use Permit to conduct oil and gas

28 production operations within the County. Aera's predecessors-in-interest applied for, and

ATRORNIYS ATLAW
LOs ANCALES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

received, the following Special Use Permits authorizing production of oil and gas on real property

2 overlaying the Ventura Field:

3 Special Use Permit No. 19, dated February 24, 1948;

4 Special Use Permit No. 35, dated November 16, 1948;

5 Special Use Permit No. 45, dated April 19, 1949;

6 Special Use Permit No. 48, dated June 21, 1949;

7 Special Use Permit No. 65, dated November 22, 1949;

8 Special Use Permit No. 445, dated January 24, 1956; and

9 (collectively, the "Special Use Permits")

10 18. The Special Use Permits all contain nearly identical authorizing language, granting

11 the permit holder the right to engage in the following activities:

12 "drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and
13 installing and using buildings, equipment and other appurtenances accessory thereto, including pipe lines but specifically excluding processing, refining,
14 packaging, bulk storage or any other use specified in Ordinance No. 412 as requiring review and special use permit."
15 The Special Use Permits did not include any requirement for subsequent discretionary review or

16 approvals from the County and did not include any requirement that the wells or production

17 facilities within the permit boundaries be subject to location, spacing, or other conditions. The

18 Special Use Permits also did not include an expiration date or other temporal limitation. Rather,

19 they authorized the permit holder to drill for, and extract, any oil, gas and other hydrocarbon
20 substances within the confines of the permit holder's property and to install the infrastructure

21 necessary to achieve that purpose. (A true and correct copy of a map specifying the real property

22 covered by each Special Use Permit is attached hereto as Exhibit A).

23 19. Under the authority of the Special Use Permits, Aera and its predecessors-in-

24 interest invested hundreds of millions of dollars in wells, tanks, pumps, pipelines and related

25 facilities to pursue full development of the oil and gas resources underlying the lands covered by

26 the Special Use Permits. In addition, on December 4, 1975, Aera was granted Conditional Use

27 Permit No. 3573, authorizing the installation and maintenance of an oil and liquid gas storage

28

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 tank and loading operation. This facility, which has been constructed and is operational, stores

2 natural gas liquids, which are loaded into trucks and conveyed elsewhere for further processing.

3 20. Through its work and investment in the Ventura Field, Aera has exhibited a clear

4 intent to maintain and expand its operations over the entire tracts of land covered by the Special

5 Use Permits, as necessary, to fully recover all available oil and gas resources. Today, Aera has

6 hundreds of active wells operating in the Ventura Field and plans to install additional wells

7 regularly during the remaining productive life of the Field. Currently, the Ventura Field contains

8 approximately 2.7 billion barrels of remaining oil, a significant portion of which is recoverable

9 and will require several decades to recover.

10 21. Having already authorized the development of Aera's wells, tanks, pumps and

11 related infrastructure via the Special Use Permits, the County required no additional discretionary

12 review for construction of facilities, installation of new wells, replacement of wells, re-drilling of

13 existing wells or abandonment of wells. If Aera were unable to continue to install, replace, re-

14 drill, rework, and abandon wells and maintain its related production facilities, oil production in

15 the Ventura Field would immediately suffer an accelerated decline and many of Aera's

16 investments would be substantially devalued.

17 B. State Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations

18 22. Aera's development of oil and gas resources in the Ventura Field has long been

19 closely regulated and supervised by the State. More than a century a ago, the California Legislature

20 created the agency now known as CalGEM to oversee the beneficial exploitation of oil and gas

21 and to ensure the safe recovery of energy resources in the State. Since that time, CalGEM

22 (formerly known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) has been the primary

23 regulatory authority for oil and gas development in the State.

24 23. Over the years, California has adopted numerous statutes and regulations that

25 comprehensively regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. California law vests

26 complete authority in CalGEM to "supervise the drilling, operation, maintenance, and

27 abandonment of wells SO as to permit owners or operators of wells to utilize all methods and
28 practices known to the oil industry for the purpose of increasing the ultimate recovery of

1 underground hydrocarbons and which, in the opinion of the supervisor, are suitable for this

2 purpose in each proposed case." Pub. Res. Code §3106(b). Prior to drilling, re-drilling,

3 reworking, repairing, deepening or abandoning a well, Aera is required is to notify CalGEM of its

4 intent, submit supporting documentation, and obtain written authorization from CalGEM prior to

5 commencing well operations. Through the 2040 General Plan, the County is now, for the first

6 time, seeking to inject itself into the approval process.

7 C. The 2040 General Plan

8 24. California law requires that every county and city adopt a general plan "for the

9 physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its boundaries, which in the

10 planning agency's judgment bears relation to its planning." Gov. Code § 65300. According to

11 the County, all area plans, specific plans, subdivisions, public works projects, and zoning

12 decisions must be consistent with the direction provided in the County's General Plan, which

13 serves as the County's "blueprint" for future decisions.

14 25. In approximately 2015, the County initiated work on updating its existing General

15 Plan. As originally presented to the public and the consultant hired to complete the work, the

16 update to the General Plan included updating the General Plan's Housing Element, and updating

17 the County's Zoning Ordinance to implement the new General Plan policies. However, the

18 County subsequently decided to treat the Housing Element update and the Zoning Ordinance

19 update as separate, unrelated projects.

20 26. The new General Plan, referred to as the 2040 General Plan, is comprised of a

21 collection of nine "elements" or topical categories. One of the elements, "Conservation and Open

22 Space," purports to focus on "the long-term preservation and conservation of the natural and open

23 space environment.» (2040 General Plan, at 1-6). Contained within that element is a section

24 devoted to oil and gas resources, which secks to regulate oil and gas activities within the County

25 by enacting a number of new policies that would constrain and greatly impair ongoing oil and gas

26 production (collectively, the "Oil and Gas Policies"). These policies include, but are not limited

27 to, the following:

28

MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3 8 - PHILLIPS, LLP
ATTCRNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- "COS-7.2 Oil Well Distance Criteria: The County shall require new

2 discretionary oil wells to be located a minimum of 1,500 feet from residential dwellings

3 and 2,500 from any school.

4 COS-7.4 Electrically-Powered Equipment for Oil and Gas Exploration and

5 Production: The County shall require discretionary development for oil and gas

6 exploration and production to use electrically-powered equipment from 100 percent

7 renewable sources and cogeneration, where feasible, to reduce air pollution and

8 greenhouse gas emissions from internal combustion engines and equipment.

9 COS-7.7 Conveyance for Oil and Produced Water: The County shall require

10

11 new discretionary oil wells to use pipelines to convey oil and produced water; oil and
produced water shall not be trucked.

12 COS-7.8 Gas Collection, Use, and Disposal: The County shall require that gases

13 emitted from all new discretionary oil and gas wells shall be collected and used or

14 removed for sale or proper disposal. Flaring or venting shall only be allowed in cases of

15 emergency or for testing purposes." (2040 General Plan, at 6-12, 6-13).

16 The Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan purport to apply only to "new discretionary"

17 oil wells or development. While the term "new discretionary" is not defined, regardless of its

18 definition it is of no valid legal effect because the County is preempted from regulating the

19

20 conduct of oil and gas operations, regardless of whether the operations involve new facilities, or a
modification or expansion of existing facilities. Rather, CalGEM is exclusively empowered to

21

22 regulate oil and gas well operations, including the approval and operation of new wells in existing
fields. Through the 2040 General Plan, the County is attempting to regulate in an area fully

23 occupied by State and Federal law.

24 27. In conjunction with the 2040 General Plan, the County also proposed separate

25

26 "Amendments to the County's Zoning Ordinances Regarding Oil and Gas Development" (the
"Proposed Zoning Amendments"), which are designed to implement the Oil and Gas Policies of

27 the 2040 General Plan. According to the County Planning Commission's Staff Report, the

28

MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3
PHILLIPS, LLP -9-

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
Los ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Proposed Zoning Amendments, which are slated for adoption by the Board of Supervisors on

2 November 10, 2020, would amend the County Zoning Code:

3 "to require the issuance of a new [Conditional Use Permit], or approval of a

4 discretionary permit adjustment or modification, to authorize all new oil and gas development, including that proposed under [the Special Use Permits], unless the

5 proposed development is already specifically described as being authorized under an existing CUP." (July 30, 2020 Staff Report for PL20-0052, at 7).

6 28. The Special Use Permits held by Aera do not specifically describe the

7 developments that are authorized. Rather, the Special Use Permits were understood and designed

8 to grant the permit holder the right to fully develop its oil and gas resources, consistent with state

9 and federal regulations, without specifically describing each authorized development. Thus, by

10 altering the permitting process to now require a new Conditional Use Permit for all oil and gas

11 development except that which has previously been "specifically described" in prior Special Use

12 Permits the Proposed Zoning Amendments would require Aera to undergo discretionary review

13 (and obtain a new Conditional Use Permit) prior to: (1) installing any new well, tank or other oil

14 field facilities; or (2) re-drilling or deepening any existing well. As a result, the Proposed Zoning

15 Amendments demonstrate the County's intent to apply the Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040
16 General Plan to all new wells, tanks, and other oil field facilities.

17 29. The Oil and Gas Policies significantly restrict Aera's oil and gas production in the

18 County. For example, Aera currently operates active wells and production facilities within 1,500

19 feet of residential dwellings or 2,500 feet from a school. The Oil and Gas Policies (specifically

20 COS 7.2) would prohibit Aera from maintaining or extending the productive life of those wells by

21 re-drilling or deepening them, and would prohibit Aera from installing new wells in that area, all

22 of which are necessary to maintain production over time. Additionally, the County's requirement

23 that all discretionary development for oil and gas exploration and production utilize electrically-

24 powered equipment from 100 percent renewable sources and cogeneration (COS 7.4) would

25 undermine Aera's ability to drill new wells and re-drill existing wells in the Ventura Field by

26 creating an undue risk to the health and safety of Aera's workers, the public, and the environment.

27 It also directly contradicts the Ventura County Air Pollution District's (a special district with

28 delegated authority from the State and EPA) rules specifically mandating the use of grid power
MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3
PHILLIFS, LLP 10 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELIS VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 for all drilling operations. The County's prohibition on trucking oil and produced water within

2 the County (COS 7.7) impermissibly disrupts, among other things, Aera's storage tank

3 operations, which rely on trucks to transport oil and natural gas liquids to off-site facilities for

4 further processing.

5 30. Given the hundreds of millions of dollars Aera has invested over decades of work

6 at the Ventura Field, and the work done pursuant to, and in reliance upon the Special Use Permits,

7 Aera's right to continue and to complete the development and production of its oil and gas

8 resources at the Ventura Field is fully vested. The Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan

9 impose an unconstitutional taking on their face, as they severely constrain and, in some cases

10 completely eliminate, Aera's vested right to continue the development and production of its oil

11 and gas resources at the Ventura Field, including the right to drill new wells, re-drill or deepen

12 existing wells, or install tanks, pipelines or other oilfield facilities.

13 D. County Efforts to Impermissibly Impair Oil and Gas Operations

14 31. The County has been impermissibly seeking to interfere with oil and gas

15 operations since at least 2013, despite the fact such operations are exclusively regulated by

16 CalGEM and despite the fact that the right to conduct such operations has vested. For example,

17 on approximately May 21, 2013, the Board directed County staff to investigate the County's

18 ability to regulate the use of fluids used in oil well stimulation and "the options available to

19 address antiquated oil & gas permits" such as the Special Use Permits described above. On

20 approximately December 17, 2013, County staff advised the Board that: (a) the County was

21 preempted from adopting regulations relating to well stimulation fluids and (b) "the County has

22 only a limited ability to address antiquated oilfield permits due to the vested rights doctrine and

23 constitutional takings and due process principles."

24 32. In approximately 2014, County staff again advised County decision-makers that

25 oil and gas operations authorized under antiquated oilfield permits cannot be further conditioned

26 "through an ordinary exercise of the police power for the general welfare." And in approximately

27 2015, County staff again advised County decision-makers that oil and gas operations authorized

28 under antiquated oilfield permits "cannot be unilaterally impaired by the County under its general
MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3

- land use authority." Nevertheless, the County pressed forward with the Oil and Gas

2 Amendments.

3 E. The 2040 General Plan Environmental Impact Report

4 33.

5 As noted above, the County initiated an update to its existing general plan in

6 approximately 2015. On or about January 14, 2019, the a County issued a Notice of Preparation

7 ("NOP") of a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Ventura County 2040 General
Plan, announcing the beginning of the environmental review process for the 2040 General Plan.

8 34. On January 13, 2020, the County purported to release its Public Review Draft

9

10 2040 General Plan and simultaneously issued a Notice of Availability ("NOA") of a Draft

11 Environmental Impact Report for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan ("DEIR"). However,

12 the DEIR was not actually distributed until January 14, 2020. Despite the County's

13 acknowledgement of concurrent preparation, neither a draft 2021 Housing Element nor a draft

14 Zoning Code Update was provided to the public, and the environmental impacts of an updated

15 Housing Element and Zoning Code Update were not considered, analyzed, or discussed in the
DEIR. No draft 2021 Housing Blement has been released to the public to date.

16 35.

17 Instead of releasing comprehensive Zoning Code Update for public review

18 concurrent with the 2040 General Plan, the County issued the Proposed Zoning Amendments

19 separately. Despite the fact that the Proposed Zoning Amendments would work in tandem with

20 the various new policies of the 2040 General Plan, the potentially significant impacts of the

21 Proposed Zoning Amendments were not disclosed in the DEIR, and no separate environmental

22 review was conducted. The Proposed Zoning Amendments are slated for adoption by the Board
of Supervisors on November 10, 2020.

23 36. In addition to the Proposed Zoning Amendments, the 2040 General Plan

24 contemplates myriad other amendments and updates to the County Zoning Code.

25 37. Aera reviewed both the Public Review Draft 2040 General Plan and the DEIR and

26

1 County to revise and recirculate the DEIR and revise the Public Review Draft 2040 General Plan

2 to bring both into compliance with the law. The County refused to do sO.

3 38. Instead of significantly revising and recirculating the DEIR and/or the Public

4 Review Draft 2040 General Plan to bring these documents into compliance with the law, the

5 County instead prepared and released a Final Environmental Impact Report for the 2040 General

6 Plan ("FEIR") (together with the DEIR, "EIR"). Despite the FEIR's 1,352-page length (plus

7 another 2,361 pages of attachments), the County released the FEIR to the public late in the day on

8 July 2, 2020, immediately prior to a federal holiday. a

9 39. The FEIR included significant new information, new analysis, and incomplete

10 responses to comments received by the County during the public review and comment period for

11 the DEIR. For example, the FEIR recalculated greenhouse gas emissions generated by the oil and

12 gas industry based on new and flawed data, but failed to provide a full public review and

13 comment period during which Aera and the public could review and comment upon this new

14 information and new analysis.

15 F. County Planning Commission Consideration of the EIR and 2040 General Plan

16 40. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the various stay at home orders in

17 place at the time, the County Planning Commission considered the 2040 General Plan, and the

18 EIR, at its July 16, 2020, meeting. Aera and others urged the County to postpone the hearing

19 until such time that the County could guarantee that no member of the community would be left

20 out of the process as a result of either technological disparities or public health risks. The County

21 refused to do so.

22 41. The County's posted agenda for the July 16, 2020 Planning Commission meeting

23 did not include any instructions regarding how to participate in the meeting virtually, and gave no

24 indication that virtual participation was even an option. Instead, the County posted inconsistent

25 and confusing instructions on virtual participation at other locations on the County website and

26 then changed its instructions mere hours before the Planning Commission meeting.

1 42. During the meeting, the livestream feed "went offline" several times, and

2 therefore, all members of the public participating virtually were unable to attend portions of the

3 meeting.

4 43. During the meeting, and prior to recommending approval and adoption of the 2040

5 General Plan and certification of the EIR, Planning Commissioners stated that the policies

6 incorporated into the 2040 General Plan - prior to CEQA review - had already been immutably

7 "adopted" by the Board in September 2019, and that any document that the Planning Commission

8 recommends to the Board for approval should include only those policies previously "adopted"

9 by the Board. Specifically, Chairman White admonished County staff for implying that proposed

10 General Plan policies could be, or had been, modified by the information contained in the EIR, or

11 that the Planning Commission should consider the EIR in recommending the policies and

12 programs of the 2040 General Plan to the Board. Said Chairman White, "[w]e are not the

13 deciders on these policies and programs. The Board is the decider." Such statements underscore

14 that the Commissioners: failed to utilize their independent judgment in reviewing both the 2040

15 General Plan and its EIR; that the Commission hearing was a meaningless and a sham; and that the

16 County predetermined and effectively "adopted" the 2040 General Plan before completing

17 environmental review and prior to the public hearings on the same.

18 44. Despite the numerous issues described above, the Planning Commission adopted a

19 motion recommending approval and adoption of the 2040 General Plan and certification of the

20 EIR to the Board.

21 G. The Board's EIR Certification and 2040 General Plan Adoption

22 45. Mere days after the Planning Commission hearing, on July 20, 2020, the County

23 closed its administrative offices completely and moved to an entirely virtual meeting schedule.

24 On September 1, 2020, the Board considered the 2040 General Plan and its EIR exclusively

25 utilizing the demonstrably defective virtual platform.

26 46. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board closed the public hearing, but then

27 also directed County Staff to make several revisions to the 2040 General Plan and EIR documents

28 and bring them back for approval on September 15, 2020. No additional environmental analysis

1 was performed to determine whether these revisions would result in new or different

2 environmental impacts from those disclosed to the public in the EIR.

3 47. On September 15, 2020, the Board adopted Resolution No 20-106, which certified

4 the EIR, adopted CEQA Findings of Fact and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, adopted

5 a Mitigation Monitoring Program, repealed the existing General Plan except for portions

6 constituting the 2014-2021 Housing Element, and approved and adopted the 2040 General Plan

9 48. Aera participated in the administrative process that resulted in the County's

10 decision to approve the 2040 General Plan and certify the EIR for the same.

11 49. Aera has exhausted all administrative remedies prior to filing this action.

12 Specifically, Aera has objected to the County's actions relating to the 2040 General Plan in

13 multiple correspondences with the County. Aera has submitted public comments to the County

14 during the public review and comment period for the DEIR, prior to, and in reference to, the

15 County's July 16, 2020, Planning Commission Hearing, and prior to, and in reference to, the

16 County's September 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020 Board Hearings.

17 50. Aera has complied with all conditions imposed by law prior to filing this action,

18 including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, by

19 providing notice to the County that this action would be filed. Aera served a Notice of Intent to

20 File this Petition on the County Clerk's Office by mail on October 9, 2020, a true and correct

21 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

22 51. Aera has also complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by providing

23 notice and copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on October 15, 2020.

1 55. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

2 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment and public

3 participation under CEQA. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

4 substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other

5 harms alleged in this Petition. As such, Aera is entitled to the recovery of attorneys' fees under

6 California Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (For Writ of Mandate, Code Civil Procedure §§ 1085)

9 56. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

10 55, above.

11 57. The laws of the State of California and the United States preempt the local

12 regulation of the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells within the State of California. The Oil

13 and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan are in conflict with, or enter an area fully occupied by,

14 in whole or in part, applicable State and Federal law.

15 58. The State has vested complete authority in CalGEM to "supervise the drilling,

16 operations, maintenance, and abandonment" of tanks, pipelines, wells and other facilities

17 attendant to oil and gas production. Pub. Res. Code §3106(a), (b). CalGEM exercises its
18 authority to carry out a dual mandate: "to permit owners or operators of wells to utilize all

19 methods and practices known to the oil industry for the purpose of increasing the ultimate

20 recovery of underground hydrocarbons" and to "prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health,

21 property, and natural resources .. Pub. Res. Code $3106.

22 59. Oil and gas operations in California are specifically governed by Division 3 of the

23 Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. Code §3000 et. seq.) and its implementing regulations. These

24 statutes address all aspects of oil and gas exploration and extraction in detail, including notice of

25 intent to drill and abandon (§§ 3203, 3229); bonding ($ § 3204-3207); abandonment (§ 3208);

26 recordkeeping ($§ 3210-3216); blowout prevention (§ 3219); use of well casing to prevent water

27 pollution (§ 3220); protection of water supplies (§S 3222, 3228); repairs (§ 3225); regulation of

28 production facilities (§ 3270); unreasonable waste of gas (§§ 3300-3314); subsidence (§§ 3315-

1 3347); spacing of wells (§§ 3600-3609); unit operations (§§ 3635-3690); and regulation of oil

2 sumps ($§ 3780-3787). CalGEM's implementing regulations are also extensive and "statewide in

3 application for onshore drilling, production, and injection operations." 14 Cal. Code Regs.

4 §1712.

5 60. CalGEM is exclusively empowered to regulate operations of oil fields, including

6 approval and operation of new wells in existing fields. As a result, CalGEM written approval is

7 required prior to commencing all well operations, including but not limited to drilling, reworking,

8 and abandoning wells. 14 Cal. Code Regs. §1714. The comprehensive system of regulations is

9 designed to empower CalGEM to "encourage the wise development of oil and gas resources."
10 Pub Res. Code §3106(d).

11 61. The County has a clear, present, mandatory, nondiscretionary, and/or ministerial

12 duty under the facts of this case to vacate the Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan that

13 restrict or halt Aera's development and production of its oil and gas resources at the Ventura Oil

14 Field. The Oil and Gas Policies are preempted by State and Federal law and are void.

15 62. Aera has fully vested right to continue and to complete the development of its oil

16 and gas resources at the Ventura Field that is protected by Art. I §§ and 19 of the California

17 Constitution. The Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan effect an unconstitutional per se

18 taking of Aera's vested right to continue the development and production of the Ventura Field.

19 63. The County's 2040 General Plan Oil and Gas Policies thus purport to unlawfully

20 restrict Aera's continued development and production of its oil and gas resources at the Ventura

21 Field in excess of the County's power, authority and jurisdiction, and constitute an abuse of the

22 County's discretion. Aera is entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandate directing the County to

23 vacate Resolution No. 20-106 adopting the 2040 General Plan and the Oil and Gas Policies

24 contained therein.

25 64. Aera has exhausted all available administrative remedies with respect to this facial

26 challenge to the 2040 General Plan. Aera has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the

27 ordinary course of law. This Petition was filed timely.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (For Declaratory Relief, Preemption)

3 65. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

4 64, above.

5 66. The 2040 General Plan, and specifically the provisions regulating oil and gas

6 resources, expressly and impliedly contradict and enter an area fully occupied by comprehensive

7 State and Federal laws. As such, they are preempted and void.

8 67. The County lacks the power, authority, and jurisdiction to regulate the drilling,

9 operation and maintenance of oil and gas wells, as those powers are exclusively functions of the

10 State of California. The laws of the State of California preempt and fully occupy the regulation

11 of drilling of oil and gas wells within the State of California. The County, through the 2040

12 General Plan, attempts to regulate aspects of oil and gas development and production that are

13 fully occupied by State law and, in fact, the Oil and Gas Policies conflict with superior law. The

14 2040 General Plan is preempted, in whole or in part, by State law, and, as such, the provisions of

15 the 2040 General Plan relating to oil and gas drilling and operations are invalid and without

16 effect.

17 68. Aera is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County disputes the

18 contentions set forth above and nevertheless intends to regulate Petitioner's oil and gas drilling

19 and operations via the 2040 General Plan.

20 69. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

21 resolve whether the 2040 General Plan is preempted, in whole or in part, by Federal and/or State

22 law.

23 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (For Writ of Mandate, Public Resources Code § 21167, Violation of CEQA)

25 70. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

26 69, above.

27 71. CEQA mandates "that the long-term protection of the environment . .. shall be the

28 guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21101(d).) To that end, CEQA
MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3
PHILLIPS, LLP - 18 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGRLES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 requires that public agencies analyze and disclose the environmental impacts of their actions prior

2 to their approval. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080(a); State CEQA Guidelines [Cal. Code Regs.,

3 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], §§ 15004, 15352(b); Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45

4 Cal.4th 116 ["Save Tara"].)

5 72. CEQA's mandates are procedural and informational, as well as substantive.

6 CEQA requires that public agencies avoid or significantly reduce environmental impacts

7 whenever feasible by implementing project alternatives and mitigation measures. (Pub.

8 Resources Code, § 21001(g).)

9 72. A public agency abuses its discretion and fails to proceed in the manner required

10 by law when its actions or decisions do not substantially comply with the requirements of CEQA.

11 (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

12 73. Where a proposed project may result in significant environmental effects, CEQA

13 requires public agencies to prepare an environmental impact report, the purpose of which is "to

14 identify the significant effects on the environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the

15 project, and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or

16 avoided." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.1(a).)

17 74. Whether an environmental impact report fails to include the information necessary

18 for an adequate analysis of an environmental issue is a question a of law, and when reviewed by the

19 courts, the courts do not defer to an agency's determinations. (Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc.

20 V. County of Madera (2001) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102 ["whether an EIR is sufficient as an

21 informational document is a question of law subject to independent review by the courts"].)

22 75. Failure to comply with the basic substantive requirements of CEQA is necessarily

23 prejudicial error, requiring the decertification of any environmental impact report and vacation of

24 any approvals adopted in reliance upon the same. (North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura

25 (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 671.)

26 76. The County has violated CEQA by failing to prepare an adequate environmental

27 impact report that meets all of CEQA's procedural and substantive mandates prior to the Board's

28 action on September 15, 2020 to approve and adopt the 2040 General Plan.
MANATT, PHBLPS & 326878608.3
PHILLIPS, LLP 19 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANCRLES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 77. The County has violated CEQA by engaging in improper and illegal piecemealing

2 and project segmentation, which occurs when a public agency chops up a proposed project into

3 smaller pieces to create the illusion of fewer environmental impacts, and to hide the true

4 magnitude of its actions. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of

5 Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214 [CEQA "cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed

6 projects into bite-sized pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no

7 significant effect on the environment"].) CEQA requires that public agencies analyze the "whole

8 of the project," which includes all related actions, all implementation actions, and all reasonably

9 foreseeable subsequent actions. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a), (c)-(d).)

10 78. Among other failings, the County has illegally piecemealed environmental

11 analysis by:

12 (a) Omitting and ignoring the County's pending 2021-2029 Housing Element

13 in the environmental review and adoption of the 2040 General Plan, despite

14 the fact that the 2021-2029 Housing Element will require near immediate

15 and wholly foreseeable revisions to the 2040 General Plan that will change

16 the magnitude of the impacts disclosed in the 2040 General Plan EIR;

17 (b) Refusing to analyze the environmental impacts of the implementation

18 actions established and required by the 2040 General Plan, despite the fact

19 these are reasonably foresecable and part of the "whole of the project"; and

20 (c) Purposefully considering the Proposed Zoning Amendments in a separate

21 action and without CEQA review, in a classic example of "chopping up

22 proposed projects into bite-sized pieces which, individually considered,

23 might be found to have no significant effect on the environment."

24 79. The County has violated CEQA by failing to provide a complete, adequate, and

25 concrete project description within the DEIR. EIR project descriptions must be accurate, stable,

26 consistent, complete, include all components of a proposed project, and include all foreseeable

27 future activities that are consequences of the project to be approved. (County of Inyo v. City of

28 Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) The County's failure to provide an accurate project

Los ANGRI I5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 description violates CEQA on its own, and also undermines each and every environmental impact

2 analysis contained within the DEIR.

3 80. Among other failings, the DEIR's project description is impermissibly vague and

4 incomplete in that it:

5 (a) Fails to identify the location and buildout of new land use designations,

6 making it impossible to analyze fully the impacts of the proposed land use

7 plan;

8 (b) Fails to describe-even in the most general sense-the goals, policies and

9 implementation programs that will be imposed as a result of 2040 General

10 Plan adoption and which are likely to result in physical impacts;

11 (c) Buries and scatters key project details throughout a separate, 1,000+ page

12 appendix, and ignores and wholly omits key aspects and reasonably

13 foresecable implementation actions of the 2040 General Plan, such as the

14 concurrently-prepared 2021-2029 Housing Element and the Proposed

15 Zoning Amendments that will be required to implement the 2040 General

16 Plan;

17 (d) Fails to account for last-minute revisions and additions made to the 2040

18 General Plan by County Staff and the Board of Supervisors, long after

19 CEQA review had been completed; and

20 (e) Relies upon flawed assumptions, including but not limited to, erroneous

21 growth projections and false assumptions relating to existing greenhouse

22 gas emissions within the County.

23 81. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately describe the existing

24 environmental setting and project baseline, against which the impacts of the 2040 General Plan

25 must be compared. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15125, 15126.2(a)). Environmental impact

26 reports must "delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining a

27 'baseline' against which predicted effects can be described and quantified" and failure to do so

28 results in a fundamental inability to accurately analyze and disclose environmental impacts.

LOS ANCH.F5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Constr. Auth. (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447.)

2 82. Among other failings, the EIR's description of the existing environmental setting

3 and project baseline is flawed in that it:

4 (a) Impermissibly buries description of the existing environmental setting in a

5 1,000+ page appendix;

6 (b) Presents a biased and incomplete accounting of the County's existing

7 greenhouse gas emissions generators; and

8 (c) Relies upon unsupported assumptions, such as a growth rate "chosen by

9 direction of the County Board of Supervisors" instead of one based upon

10 substantial evidence.

11 83. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately analyze the 2040 General

12 Plan's impacts on the existing environment. (Pub. Resources Code, §21100(b); State CEQA

13 Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2).

14 84. Specifically, the County has failed to adequately analyze and disclose impacts of

15 the 2040 General Plan on aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources,

16 cultural and tribal cultural resources, energy and energy stability, geological hazards, greenhouse

17 gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, human health, wildfire, hydrology, water quality,

18 water consumption and conservation, land use planning, mineral and petroleum resources, noise

19 and vibration, population and housing, public services and recreation, and transportation and

20 traffic. Relatedly, the County has failed to analyze adequately and disclose cumulative impacts.

21 85. By way of example, just some of the ways in which the County's environmental

22 impacts analysis was flawed, include:

23 a) Ignoring the air quality impacts associated with implementation of 2040 General

24 Plan Policies COS-7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.7, and 7.8;

25 b) Failing to account for air quality impacts associated with favoring imported oil

26 over oil produced within the County;

27 c) Failing to consider and disclose impacts on local and statewide energy supplies,

28 requirements for additional energy capacity, impacts on demands for energy, and

2 Guidelines;

3 d) Failing to account for the greenhouse gas emissions associated with importing

4 crude oil developed and produced elsewhere, and shipped, piped, or trucked to

5 refineries that would otherwise process crude oil from the County;

6 e) Failing to identify substantial evidence supporting the EIR's conclusions relating

7 to hazards and hazardous materials;

8 f) Failing to analyze changes in water consumption associated with construction,

9 including construction of oil and gas pipelines, and related impacts on hydrology

10 and water quality;

11 g) Failing to analyze and disclose impacts on mineral and resource accessibility;

12 h) Failing to account for the impacts associated with meeting the County's Regional

13 Housing Needs Allocation obligations, under which the South Coast Association

14 of Governments allocates a given portion of California's housing need to the

15 County, and the County must revise its General Plan and Zoning to accommodate

16 that growth; and

17 i) Failing to account for all reasonably foreseeable new car and truck trips.

18 86. The County has violated CEQA by relying upon mitigation measures and 2040

19 General Plan goals, policies and programs, that are legally preempted and therefore cannot be

20 considered to reduce potentially significant environmental impacts. CEQA requires that

21 mitigation measures be fully enforceable, as well as consistent with applicable constitutional

22 standards. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(2), (4).) Nevertheless, the DEIR incorporates

23 into its analysis of environmental impacts actions, policies, and programs that are preempted by

24 State or Federal law, violate existing private property rights, or are simply infeasible, in violation

25 of CEQA.

26 87. The County has violated CEQA by failing to consider, analyze, or disclose the

27 environmental impacts of the EIR's mitigation measures.

2 without adequate explanation or analysis, alternative or revised mitigation measures brought

3 forward by Aera, others, and/or the County's own planning staff and retained CEQA consultant

4 and that would reduce or eliminate the significant impacts identified in the EIR, or that were

5 erroneously left out of the EIR due to the EIR's flawed impacts analysis.

6 89. The County has violated CEQA by failing to identify a reasonable range of

7 alternatives, and by providing only a flawed alternatives analysis, based upon an incomplete,

8 vague, and piecemealed project description, and a flawed impacts analysis.

9 90. The County has violated CEQA by failing to revise and recirculate the DEIR,

10 despite its failure to meet CEQA's substantive and procedural mandates.

11 91. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments

16 supporting certification of the EIR.

17 94. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adopt an adequate Statement of

20 committing itself to "adopted" General Plan policies and programs as early as September 2019,

21 despite the fact that the 2040 General Plan's Draft EIR was not completed until January 2020, and

23 96. The County has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thereby

24 prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to comply with CEQA's mandates.

25 97. Aera has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy other than the issuance of a writ

26 of mandate ordering the County to forgo any and all steps in furtherance of the 2040 General Plan

27 unless and until it complies with CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.9.)

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief, Vested Rights)

3 98. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

4 97, above.

5 99. Aera contends that it has fully vested right to continue and to complete the

6 development and production of its oil and gas resources in the County, consistent with its long-

7 established plans and permits, including, without limitation, Aera's vested rights in its Special

8 Use Permits, CalGEM permits issued and to be issued to Aera, and Aera's vested rights to obtain

9 ministerial permits for its ongoing operations to drill new wells and to re-drill or deepen existing

10 wells in the County in accordance with permitting procedures established by the State of

11 California and Federal law.

12 100. Oil and gas is a diminishing asset, the extraction of which is expected to continue

13 across the entire property covered by Aera's Special Use Permits. Hansen Bros. Enterprises, Inc.

14 v. Board of Supervisors, 12 Cal.4th 533 (1996). Aera has long exhibited its intent to extend its oil

15 and gas operations to its entire property consistent with its vested rights.

16 101. Aera is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County disputes

17 Aera's contentions set forth above. and intends to restrict Aera's oil and gas operations by way of

18 the 2040 General Plan, and specifically the Oil and Gas Policies contained therein.

19 102. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by a the Court, is necessary to

20 resolve whether Aera has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and

21 production of its oil and gas resources in the County.

22 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (For Inverse Condemnation, U.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment; California Constitution,

24 Article 1, Section 19)

25 103. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

26 102, above.

27 104. By purporting to eliminate Aera's vested right to continue and to complete the

28 development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County, the 2040 Genera Plan

ATTORNES AT LAW
LOs ANCELPS VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 effects a taking of Aera's property. The economic impact of the 2040 General Plan will be

2 severe, as it would virtually eliminate the economic value of Aera's property. Furthermore, the

3 2040 General Plan interferes with Aera's reasonable investment-backed expectations, as Aera

4 reasonably expected it could exercise its existing, lawful, and fully vested right to continue and to

5 complete the development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County.

6 105. The 2040 General Plan will force Aera to bear public burdens which, in all fairness

7 and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. In enacting the 2040 General Plan the

8 County violates Article 1, Section 19 of the California Constitution, which prohibits the taking or

9 damaging of private property for public use without just compensation. The County also violates
10 the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

11 106. As a direct result of the County's actions as alleged herein, the Oil and Gas

12 Policies of the 2040 General Plan constitute taking. To date, Aera has not received any

13 compensation from the County as a result of the above a alleged taking or damage to Aera's

14 property rights.

15 107. Aera has been and will be damaged from the taking of its property rights in the

16 Ventura Field, and will suffer damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

17 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of Substantive Due Process)

19 108. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

20 107, above.

21 109. County laws and ordinances must be clear, precise, definite and certain in their

22 terms SO that their precise meaning can be ascertained. Statutes which either forbid or require the

23 doing of an act in terms sO vague that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at

24 their meaning and differ as to their application, violate due process of law. Zubarau v. City of

25 Palmdale, 192 Cal.App.4th 289, 308 (2011).

26 110. The 2040 General Plan is impermissibly vague because it fails to provide adequate

27 notice to those who must comply with its strictures of what conduct is prohibited and what is

28 allowed. For example, the 2040 General Plan purports to require "discretionary development for
MANATT, PHELPS & 326878608.3

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 oil and gas exploration and production 1o use electronically-powered equipment from 100 percent

2 renewable sources and cogeneration, where feasible, to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas

3 emissions from internal combustion engines and equipment." The term "discretionary

4 development for oil and gas exploration and production" is vague and uncertain. People of

5 ordinary intelligence will differ as to whether it applies to each and every aspect of Aera's

6 business that relates in any way to oil and gas exploration and production, or some subset of the

7 business that constitutes actual oil and gas exploration, or production, or both. It is also unclear

8 when the use of electronically powered equipment from 100 percent renewable sources is feasible

9 or infeasible, and who makes that determination based on what criteria. A statute is

10 impermissibly vague if it delegates basic policy matters to judges and juries for resolution. The

11 2040 General Plan does so.

12 111. The 2040 General Plan also states: "oil and produced water shall not be trucked."

13 (COS 7.7). It is unclear whether that constitutes a blanket prohibition against the transportation

14 of any amount of oil or produced water, for any purpose, via truck throughout the County, or if

15 the transportation of some amount of oil or produced water, for certain purposes, is permitted.

16 112. Due to the vague and uncertain composition of the Oil and Gas Policies in the

17 2040 General Plan, the County has failed to provide Aera, or the public, with adequate notice of

18 what conduct is required.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 WHEREFORE, Aera prays for the following relief:

21 1. For writ of mandate directing the County to vacate Resolution No. 20-106

22 adopting the 2040 General Plan and the Oil and Gas Policies contained therein, certifying the

23 2040 General Plan Final Environmental Impact Report, adopting the CEQA Findings of Fact and

24 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adopting the Mitigation Monitoring Program;

25 2. For a declaration that the 2040 General Plan is preempted, in whole or in part, by

26 Federal and/or State law, and is invalid and without effect, including as to Aera's operations

27 within the County;
