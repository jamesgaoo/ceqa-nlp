2 through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive
3 Relief ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

6 "Respondent") of the environmental exemption determination and the related discretionary
7 approvals (together, the "Project Approvals") for a proposed development project located at 6500

8 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 13 February 5, 2020. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because
Hills, Beverly 14 Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental
15 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and
16 Zoning Law, and local laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
17 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil

16 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
17| Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
18| alleged in this Petition.
19 8. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written
20 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

2 PROJECT

3 12. The proposed project involves rear and side additions to a one-story single-family
residence in the South Carthay Historic Preservation Overlay Zone ("South Carthay HPOZ" or

5 "HPOZ"). The property is identified as a Contributing Element in the South Carthay HPOZ. The

6 project site is located at the southwest corner of the intersection between West Olympic Place

7 and South La Jolla Avenue, located in an R1-1-O-HPOZ zone with a Low II Residential land use

8 designation in the Wilshire Community Plan Area.

13. The proposed project consists of a 178 square-foot first-story rear addition, a 938
10 square-foot second-story rear addition, a 28 square-foot first-story side addition, and the addition

Channel Law Group, d17 LIZ06 LA0S VPNE MLHLSI NG SSS SIl!H Auexeg 12 in the South Carthay HPOZ. The proposed roof height of the second-story rear addition will be
13 25 feet. The first-story rear addition will be created by enclosing a 150 square-foot porch. The 28
14 square foot side addition will be created by enclosing a porch on the cast elevation, which faces
15 La Jolla Avenue

16 14. The 8,834-square-foot site is currently developed with a single-story single-family
17 residence. The subject residence is a Spanish Colonial Revival style house that was built in 1937
18 and is a Contributing Feature in the South Carthay HPOZ. At the time of the 1982 Historic
19 Resources Survey no major alterations were found at the property, and the property was
20 designated as Contributor in the South Carthay HPOZ on the basis that it adds to the historic
21 architectural qualities or historic associations for which a property is significant because it was
22 present during the period of significance, and possesses historic integrity reflecting its character
23 at that time. Noted landscape features at the property are the palm trees behind the front garden

1 HPOZ BACKGROUND

2 15. The South Carthay Historic Preservation Overlay Zone ("HPOZ") is a district of
3 approximately 355 structures developed primarily during the period of 1932 through 1939. The
district was formally adopted as an HPOZ by the City of Los Angeles in 1985. Nearly half of the
5 single-family dwellings in South Carthay were designed and built by Greek developer Spyros

6 George Ponty, who built homes throughout Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Ponty and other
7 || contractors constructed homes in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The characteristic use of
8 low-pitched red tile roofs, arched doors and windows, and smooth stucco exterior finishes
provides visual continuity and cohesiveness to the neighborhood. Many streets within the HPOZ
10 are entirely comprised of one-story single-family residences, while others are entirely comprised
11
8 of two-story single or multi-family residences. South Carthay residences are exceptional for their
Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 SW!H LO VPET EH SIM S CO Beverly 12 quality construction, skilled craftsmanship, decorative detailing, and individuality.
13 16. Section 12.20.3.K. of the LAMC requires that Department of City Planning Staff
14 refer applications for Certificates of Appropriateness to both the South Carthay HPOZ Board and
15 the Cultural Heritage Commission (or its designee)("CHC") within a 30-day period of the
16 application having been deemed complete.
17 17. The South Carthay HPOZ Preservation Plan, adopted in 2010, contains guidelines
18 to which proposed projects must adhere. Prior to the 2010 adoption of the South Carthay HPOZ
19 Preservation Plan, projects were evaluated for conformance with the Secretary of the Interior's
20 Standards for Rehabilitation.

21 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

22 18. In order to facilitate the Project, the Real Parties in Interest applied for a
23 Certificate of Appropriateness. The subject application was deemed complete on July 22, 2019
24 19. Section 12.20.3 M of the LAMC requires that before making its recommendation
25 to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove an application pursuant to this section for a
26 Certificate of Appropriateness, the South Carthay HPOZ Board shall hold a public hearing on the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 matter. The South Carthay HPOZ Board met on August 15, 2019 and conducted a public hearing

2 on the proposed project, pursuant to LAMC Section 12.20.3 M. The South Carthay HPOZ

3 Board, with a seven-member quorum, unanimously recommended denial of the project, citing
4 non-compliance with Guideline 8.2.3, which states, "Additions that comprise a new floor (for

5 instance a new second floor on a single-story house) are not appropriate." Citing similar
6 concerns, several members of the public spoke in opposition of the proposed project, while
7 several members of the public spoke in support of it. Department of City Planning Staff sent

8 copies of the application with relevant materials to the CHC's designee on August 1, 2019. The
CHC recommended denial of the project, citing noncompliance with the adopted South Carthay
10 HPOZ Preservation Plan and commenting, "Preservation Plan discourages 2nd story additions to

11
8 one-story houses. Addition should only be one story."
Channel Law 'dnoig d77 LLZ06 12 20. On October 7, 2019, a Director's Determination was issued to deny a Certificate

13 8 euns "PAIE BIJUSIIM E8E8 of Appropriateness for the construction of a two-story rear addition and the infill of a side-facing
'SI!H Áuereg 14 porch on a one-story single-family structure. Among other things, the Director determined that
15 the Project substantially deviated from LAMC Section 12.20.3 K.4(c) because the project overall
16 did not comply with the adopted Preservation Plan approved by the City Planning Commission
17 for the Preservation Zone. The Determination Letter issued by the Director detailed
18 inconsistences with Guideline 7.5 (which relates to alternations of porches). Further, the Director
19 noted that the proposed project was inconsistent with Guideline 8.2 because the proposed project
20 includes a second-story addition to an existing one-story structure. The Director also found that
21 the proposed second-story addition's height and street-visibility was not subordinate to the
22 existing primary structure (required by Guideline 8.2.10). The City did not conduct any
23 environmental review under CEQA because the City's action constituted an exemption from

24 to Section 15061 (b)(4) and 15270. CEQA pursuant

22. A public hearing was conducted on December 10, 2019 by the Central Area
2 Planning Commission to consider the appeal of the Director of Planning's October 7, 2019
3  determination to deny a Certificate of Appropriateness. Staff recommended denial of the appeal.
After hearing public testimony and a presentation from both the appellant and

5 staff, the Central Area Planning Commission denied the appeal and sustained the Planning 23.

7 24. However, On January 17, 2020, Councilman Paul Koretz moved to assert
8 jurisdiction over the December 10, 2019 Central Area Planning Commission action to deny the
appeal. The motion was subsequently adopted by the City Council on January 21, 2020.
10 Thereafter, a public hearing was conducted on February 4, 2020 to consider the appeal before the 9

11 Planning and Land Use Management Committee ("PLUM" or "Committee"). At the urging of 8 d77 'dnoJg MET jeuueyo LLZ06 EINS "PAE BJlUSI!M E8E8 12| Councilmember Koretz (and over the strong objections from many members of the immediate
13 8 neighborhood and members of the South Carthay HPOZ Board), the Committee recommended

SIl!H ÁueAeg that the Committee grant the appeal and thereby approve the Certificate of Appropriateness. The
15 Committee's recommendation was considered by the City Council on February 5, 2020. The 14

16 City Council concurred with the Committee's recommendation and approved the appeal. The
action became final at the conclusion of the next City Council meeting on February 7, 2020. The
18 City did not conduct any environmental review and instead found that the Project was exempt 17

19 from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15303 Class 3.
20 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

21 25. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

23 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 22 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

24 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure

26 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects 25 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that

2 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

3 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

4 26. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
5 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
6 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope

7 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved

8 a by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California
Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and

10 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387

11 27. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental 8 Channel Law Group, LLP LLZ06 1A0  VPINS M ASI A  CB Beverly Hills, 12 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
13 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

14 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have significant effect on the
15 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
16 v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
17 28. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
18 | declaration that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,

19 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
20 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an "environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the

25 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
26 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as

Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 ANS  VPNS UHLSIM SE Beverly Hills, 12 Determinations.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Project is Not Exempt from CEQA)
15 31. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
16 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
17 32. The City did not conduct any environmental review and instead found that the
18 Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15303 Class 3. This
19 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures. However,
20 according to the State CEQA Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of
21 this exemption:
22 (a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the
23 project is to be located -- a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the
24 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
25 classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an
26 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
27

28 9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
2 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
3 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
significant.
(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on
the environment due to unusual circumstances.

8 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project

which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,

10 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
11 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are 8 Channel Law Group, d77 4LZ06 ens "PAa eJJySI!M €888 12 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
13 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project 8
SIl!H Beverly 14 located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of
15 the Government Code.

16 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
17 which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.
18 33. Respondent was presented with evidence demonstrating that the Project was not

19 exempt from CEQA. The City was informed that because the Project was in the HPOZ, a
20 categorical exemption could not be utilized because of (1) significant and negative impacts on
21 historical resources; 2) significant negative cumulative impacts; 3) significant negative impacts
22 due to unusual circumstances; and 4) significant impacts due to the Project's location in a
23 sensitive location.

24 34. A member of Petitioner cautioned the City that the Project substantially,
25 irreversibly, and adversely altered the home itself, an original single floor Spanish colonial style
26 home. That same member went on to state as follows: "The second-floor addition would mean

27

10 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the home would no longer be an example of the original 1930s Spanish colonial architecture that
2 the HPOZ was designed to preserve. Further, the Project substantially and adversely affects the
3 neighborhood generally, as the collection of intact single story 1930s Spanish colonial homes
give the neighborhood the uniformity and character that the HPOZ was designed to preserve.

5 Furthermore, the HPOZ Board and the Central Los Angeles Planning Commission denied the

6 Project, which supports the conclusion that the Project would materially harm a historic resource.
7 The Project was denied because the Project did not conform to the HPOZ prohibition against

8 second story additions, impermissibly altered a historical home, and did not fit in with the

9 historical architecture and character of the neighborhood. Therefore, because the Project
10 substantially and aversely harms and changes the significance of a historical resource, a

11
8 Categorical Exemption from CEQA cannot be granted in this case.
Channel Law Group, d77 euNS "pALa eJJuS|!M E888 4LZ06 12 35. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

8 13 by failing to conduct any environmental review for the Project Accordingly, Respondent's
Beverly Hills, 14 exemption determination must be set aside.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAW: Project Inconsistent with South Carthay Preservation

17 Plan and Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12. 20.3 K)
18 36. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
19 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
20 37. LAMC Section 12.20.3 K.4 outlines the "standards for issuance of certificate of
21 construction, addition, alteration or reconsideration," If a preservation plan exists, the Director
22 of Planning is required to base a determination of whether to approve a Certificate of
23 Appropriateness on "whether the Project complies with the Preservation Plan approved by the
24 City Planning Commission for the Preservation Zone." The City Council decision to overrule the
25 decision of the Director and the Area Planning Commission is not supported by substantial
26 evidence in the record.

1 38. The Preservation Plan outlines the following with regard to porches:

2 7.5 Porches
3 7.5.1. Historic porches, especially on the front and side facades, should be preserved in
place. The removal of historic porches is inappropriate. 7.5.2. Decorative details that help 10 define an historic porch should be preserved. These include balusters, balustrades, columns, and brackets. The State Historic Building Code allows balustrades and railings that do not meet current building code heights to remain
7.5.8. Enclosure of part or all of an historic porch is inappropriate, especially when ifthey do not pose a safety hazard.
located on the primary facade or visible from the public right-of-way. 7.5.9. Enclosure of a porch at the side or rear of the house, for instance a sleeping porch,
8 may be appropriate if the porch form is preserved and the porch openings are fitted with windows in a manner that they can be removed in the future without damage to the 9 original structure.

17 partial wall screening the door. While the stucco relief surrounding the porch archway would be

18 preserved, the porch opening would be fitted with a wall rather than windows, and the porch

19 form would not be preserved. For these reasons, the proposed project does not meet the above

20 guidelines.

1 Preservation Plan adoption. However, this document was created in 2015-2016 specifically for

2 the Carthay Square, EI Sereno-Berkshire Craftsman District, Miracle Mile, Oxford Square and

3 Sunset Square HPOZs which were being adopted at the time, not to the South Carthay HPOZ.

4 The Preservation Plans for these HPOZs do not contain language citing additions comprising a

5 new floor as inappropriate, as is found in the South Carthay HPOZ Preservation Plan.

6 46. The language "not appropriate," while still within a Guideline, is the most
7 prohibitive language found in the HPOZ Preservation Plans. In recommending denial of the
8 proposed project, both the CHC designee and the HPOZ Board cited the inappropriateness of an
addition that comprises a new floor.

47. The Preservation Plan outlines the following with regard to the scale and volume

11 of additions. ® d77 'dnoJg MET |euueyo LLZ06 SII!H LA0S MPNE TUHUSIDA SIC8 Beverly 12

13 8.2.10. Additions should be subordinate in scale and volume to the existing house.
Additions that involve more than a 50% increase in the ground floor plate are generally
14 inappropriate.

15
48. The Project does not comply with the Preservation plan's guidelines regarding the
16 scale and volume of additions. Due to the proposed second-story addition's height and street-
17 visibility, it is not subordinate to the existing primary structure. Because the property is on a
18 comer lot, the second-story addition would be visible from two streets. From the north elevation,
19 the addition would be seen from Olympic Place, as it rises four feet and six inches above the
20 ridge of the existing gable to the north. From the east elevation, larger portion of the second-
21 story addition would be visible from La Jolla Avenue over the ridge of the existing gable to the
22 is east, which is shorter than the gable to the north. Additionally, a large portion of the eleven foot-
23 ten inch tall second-story addition would be visible in its entirety from the public right-of-way on
24 La Jolla Avenue, as it would not be obscured by the existing structure at all. For these reasons,
25 the proposed project does not meet the above guideline.

49. The City Council's determination that the Project complied with the Preservation

21 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
22 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
