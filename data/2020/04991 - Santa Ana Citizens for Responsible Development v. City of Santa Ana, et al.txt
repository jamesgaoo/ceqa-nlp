VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

Petitioner/plaintiff, Santa Ana Citizens for Responsible Development, an unincorporated

2 association of concerned residents ("Petitioner"), hereby petitions this Court for a peremptory

3 writ of mandate/mandamus, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, to be

4 directed to respondents/defendants, the City of Santa Ana ("City") and its City Council

5 (collectively, "Respondents"), along with other causes of action alleged herein, including as to the

6 applicant and real party in interest AC 2525 Main, LLC (*Applicant"), and real party in interest

7 Discovery Science Center of Orange County ("Discovery Science Center"). This

8 petition/complaint alleges conduct in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.

9 Resources Code, §§ 21000-21189.57) ("CEQA").

10 THE PARTIES

11 1. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of concerned City residents. Diane

12 Fradkin is City resident and a member of Petitioner. Ms. Fradkin lives within one mile of the

HJA3WM3N DILLION C 13 project at issue in this petition ("Magnolia at the Park" or the "Project"), which includes the

14 demolition of an existing office building and development of a 256-unit multi-family residential

15 development with associated parking, located at 2525 N. Main Street, Santa Ana, California. Ms.

16 Fradkin will be directly affected by the Project's numerous significant and unmitigated

17 environmental impacts and has standing to seek such relief as that requested herein. Petitioner

18 has standing based on the standing of its members, including, without limitation, Ms. Fradkin.

19 2. Respondent/defendant City is a public entity located in the State of California.

20 The City is required to comply with state, local, and federal law, rules, and regulations, including,

21 without limitation, CEQA.

22 3. Respondent/defendant City Council of the City of Santa Ana ("City Council") is

23 the elected governing body of the City and has final decision-making authority, including the

24 resolution of appeals. Like the City, the City Council is required to comply with local, state, and

25 federal law, including CEQA.

26 4. Petitioner is informed and believes that Applicant is a Delaware limited liability

27 corporation that is the applicant for the Project.

28 ///

4516.101 / 8560319.1 - 2 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

5. Petitioner is informed and believes that Discovery Science Center is a California

2 non-profit corporation and is a real party of interest based on its relationship to the Project

3 described below.

4 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the

5 respondents/defendants sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues them

6 by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition/complaint to allege their true names

7 and capacities when ascertained.

8 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times

9 mentioned herein, Respondents and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, were the agents, servants,

10 and employees of each other and in doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course

11 and scope of their authority as such agents, servants, and employees with the permission, consent,

12 and knowledge of each other.

d3A3WMAN 13 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
DILLION 4 14 8. CEQA requires that public agencies review potential environmental impacts of a

15 proposal and consider ways to minimize or avoid environmental damage. Under CEQA, a

16 "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

17 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

18 environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a).)

19 9. "Approval" of a project under CEQA, means a decision by the public agency

20 "which commits the agency to a definitive course of action in regard to a project intended to be

21 carried out by any person." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15352, subd. (a).)

22 10. The Project includes, among other things, the demolition of the existing office

23 building and development of a 256-unit multi-family residential development and parking on the

24 site located at 2525 N. Main Street, Santa Ana, California. Additionally, the Applicant is

25 proposing to create a second parcel to accommodate a 180-space surface level parking lot with

26 proposed use by both the Applicant and the Discovery Science Center.

27 11. The Project is generally located at the northeast corner of N. Main Street and

28 Edgewood Road, California, on an approximately 5.93 acre parcel at the address commonly
4516.101 / 8560319.1 - 3 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

2 referred to as 2525 N. Main Street, Santa Ana, California (*Property"). The Project site is located

3 across from the Discovery Cube of Orange County, on the opposite side of Main Street. The

4 Project site also abuts the Park Santiago residential neighborhood, which is adjacent to Santiago

5 Park and Santiago Creek, designated open space area.

12.

6 On information and belief, the Project includes a proposal to sell 1.4 acres of the

7 Property to Discovery Science Center. Applicant and Discovery Science Center seek to enter into

8 a mutual parking agreement to share a parking lot on a 1.4 acre portion of the parcel that is

9 revocable at any time and by either party. This parking agreement is contingent upon the City

10 first issuing a certificate of occupancy. This contingency is problematic in part because a

11 ministerial certificate may only be issued well-after the requisite discretionary approval.
13.

12 Upon information and belief, in or about late 2017, the City began preparing a

NEWMEYER DILLION G 13 Draft Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR"). As initially proposed by the Applicant, as

14 distinct from the ultimate Project, the plans included a multi-family residential development of

15 496 units (the "[nitial Plan"). Petitioner's members staunchly opposed, and one or more of them

16 publicly commented on, the Initial Plan and its Draft EIR. The City failed to meaningfully
respond.

17 14.

18 In the Draft EIR, the Initial Plan included the following project description:

3.3

19 Project Site Description

20 The project site consists of 5.93 acres of land that is developed with one

21 vacant two-story office building. The office building is 81,172 square feet in size, was constructed in 1982 and used by the Wells Fargo bank until

22 July 2017. The office building is located on the northwestern portion of the

23 project site. The building is divided into east and west wings connected by
a central two-story lobby area. The remainder of the project site consists

24 of paved driveways, surface parking areas that include 442 parking spaces, and landscaping. A portion of the existing spaces (no more than 175 per

25 the existing use agreement) are currently used by the Discovery Cube for
overflow and employee parking.

26 3.6 Project Characteristics

27

28 The proposed project would redevelop the 5.9-acre project site to provide
496 for-rent multi-family residential units. The residences would be
provided within approximately 572,075 square feet of residential

4516.101 / 8560319.1 - 4-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

Aw N- structures. The proposed development would be 5-stories and be topped with mezzanines reaching approximately 65 feet 8-inches in height. The
development would tier down to 2-stories (slightly over 20-feet in height) on the eastern portion of the site. The residential units would be wrapped around a 358,630 square foot central parking/fitness center/club room

5 a structure with a roofline of approximately 90 feet from the ground surface, which is the highest point of the proposed project. The project would result

6 in approximately 930,705 square feet of development and a density of 84 dwelling units per acre.

7 15.

8 On November 15, 2018, the City released the Final Environmental Impact Report
("Final EIR"). The City received hundreds of comments to that Final EIR, incorporated by

9

10 reference herein. The City failed to meaningfully respond to these comments. (See Final EIR,
pp. 3-1 to 7.)

11 16.

12 On or about February 19, 2019, upon recommendation of the Santa Ana Planning

d3A3WM3N Commission ("Planning Commission") to deny the Initial Plan's application and certification of

DILLION 4 13

14 the Final EIR, the City Council directed the Applicant to consult with the community and revise
its plans. (See City Council Minutes 2/19/2019.)

15 17.

16 On information and belief, between February and June of 2019, Applicant

17 modified the Initial Plan. Ultimately, the modified Initial Plan proposed a 347-unit multi-family

18 residential development ("Second Plan"). Petitioner opposed this Second Plan, as it still did not

19 address or mitigate for the significant impacts. In the City's Clarification to the Final EIR dated

20 July 11, 2019 ("July Clarifications"), the City improperly rejected that the Final EIR needed to be
recirculated. (See Clarification to Final EIR, July 11, 2019, p. 1.)

21 18.

22 On or about August 12, 2019, the Planning Commission's vote on the proposed

23 Second Plan resulted in an impasse (3 votes for, 3 votes against). (See Planning Commission

24 Minutes, Aug. 12, 2019.) The Applicant appealed the Project to the City Council. (lbid.)

19.

25 On information and belief, the Second Plan was then revised to the current Project,
an unrecognizable, rashly considered apartment complex that is a far cry from the Initial Plan

26

27 considered and evaluated in the Final EIR. The Project, in its present iteration, purports to

28 demolish the existing two-story, 81,172 square foot office building. In its stead, Applicant would
construct a 256-unit multi-family housing project on a 4.4 acre parcel at 58 dwelling units per
4516.101 / 8560319.1 - 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 acre, with 511 parking spaces proposed. (City Council Agenda, Item 75E, Staff Rept., Part 1,

2 Nov. 19, 2019.) The Project's intensity stands in harsh contrast to the nearby, far less intensive

3 land uses, including the designated open space Santiago Park to the north and the single family

4 residential homes in an R-1 zone directly to the east and south. (See City Council Agenda, Nov.

5 19, 2019, Public Hearing Item 75E.)

6 20. Proposed Project approvals included adoption of (i) a resolution certifying the

7 Final EIR; (ii) an ordinance approving a development agreement between the City and Applicant,

8 No. 2018-01 ("Development Agreement"); (iii) a resolution approving a general plan amendment

9 to amend the land use designation of the Property from "Professional and Administrative Office"

10 to "District Center"; and (iv) an ordinance approving an amendment application to rezone the

11 Property from "Professional" to "Special Development No. 93" (collectively, "Entitlements").

12 21. On October 16, 2019, the City submitted the "Clarification to the 2525 N. Main
H3A3WMIN 13 Street (Magnolia at the Park) Multi-Family Residential Project Final Environmental Impact
e NOITTIO 14 Report, State Clearinghouse Number: 2018021031, City of Santa Ana: DP No. 2017-34

15 ("October Clarifications").

16 22. In the October Clarifications, the City determined, without factual support, that the

17 Final EIR did not need to be recirculated despite the new and substantial modifications that only

18 first appeared in the October Clarifications to the Second Plan-still not the final Project.

19 (October 2019 Clarifications, p. 2.)

20 23. On October 28, 2019, the Planning Commission again recommended that the City

21 Council not certify the Final EIR and deny the proposed development and all related

22 Entitlements. (Planning Commission Minutes, Oct. 28, 2019; see also Staff Rept., Part 1, Nov.

23 19, 2019.)

24 24. One or more of Petitioner's members, among others, objected orally and/or in

25 writing at the City Council's November 19, 2019, public hearing regarding the Development

26 Agreement, the Final EIR, and the related Entitlements, thus satisfying the requirements with

27 respect to administrative exhaustion. True and correct copies of Petitioner's written objections

28 are attached hereto as Exhibit A and Exhibit B, respectively, and are incorporated by reference
- 6 - 4516.101 / 8560319.1

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

herein along with all other issues raised during the administrative process for the Project's

2 approvals.

3 25. On November 19, 2019, despite opposition from the community, Petitioner's

4 members, and the Planning Commission, the City Council adopted Resolution 2019-107

5 ("Resolution"). The Resolution certifies the Final EIR:

6 [A]dopting findings of fact pursuant to [CEQA], adopting a
7 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adopting the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; conducted first

8 reading of an ordinance approving Development Agreement No. 2018-01, as amended; adopted a resolution approving General Plan
9 Amendment No. 2018-06; and Conducted first reading of an ordinance approving Amendment Application 2018-10 for Specific
10 Development No. 93.

11 (See Notice of Determination, filed Nov. 20, 2019.)

12 26. The Resolution states that the "EIR" consists of the Final EIR, Clarifications to the

EWMEYER 4NOIT7O 13 Final EIR, as well as the Draft EIR (as modified by the Final EIR) ("EIR").

14 27. The EIR does not, as discussed in detail in the comments submitted by Petitioner's
15 members, among others, and incorporated by reference herein, effectively study, determine, or

16 evaluate recent changes made to the Project. Instead, the EIR focuses on the Initial Plan and

17 description-a completely different project than that finally contemplated.

18 28. The EIR also fails to sufficiently evaluate, determine, and mitigate for the

19 Project's environmental impacts, as outlined in the comments incorporated by reference herein.

20 The EIR, for the first time, incorporates substantial and significant new information and analyses

21 that must be allowed to undergo further public review.

22 29. For example, the Project for the first time proposes an offset intersection

23 configuration at Walkie Way and Main St., as well as a proposed new curb cut into the Project's

24 parking lot on Mainextremely close to the Main St. and Edgewood intersection.

25 30. The Project's technical studies acknowledge that this change will add traffic to the

26 preexisting backup traffic, but fail to evaluate or mitigate for the same in the EIR.

27 31. Additionally, the EIR for the first time appears to include an Arborist Report as a
28 designed mitigation measure with respect to the existing mature trees that the Project would
4516.101 / 8560319.1 - 7 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

remove. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7; see also id. at p. 2-38 [proposed statement of

2 findings discussing certain Project Design Features "PDFs" that will be implemented like

3 mitigation measures based on the Arborist Report].)

4 32. This additional measure also purportedly identifies eight trees in an unhealthy
condition recommended for removal. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7.) The City also

6 acknowledges that this removal will require further review by the Environmental and

7 Transportation Advisory Committee, but that it "will occur at a later date[-]" (See City Staff

8 Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7.) But, CEQA contemplates a full and complete environmental review

9 that occurs prior to discretionary action on the Project---not at some later date after the

10 environmental document has already been certified.

11 33. Moreover, as the statement of overriding considerations acknowledges, the Project

12 site could be used by one-special-status wildlife species: the western mastiff bat. (See City Staff

H3A3WMIN A NOITTIO 13 Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-57 [draft statement of overriding considerations].) The EIR acknowledges
14 that "the site could be used by one special-status wildlife species, the western mastiff bat, that has

15 a low potential to roost in the large trees and palms[,]" many of which are being removed for the

16 first time in the EIR due to a new mitigation measure and Arborist's Report designating certain

17 existing trees and palms as unhealthy and qualified for removal. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28,

18 2019, 2-57 [draft statement of overriding considerations].)

19 34. Despite the above, among other issues raised at the public hearing, on November

20 19, 2019, the City Council adopted a Resolution approving General Plan Amendment No 2018-

21 06, conducted a first reading of an ordinance approving Development Agreement No. 2018-01,

22 and conducted a first reading of an ordinance approving Amendment Application No 2018-10 for

23 Specific Development No. 93.

24 35. On November 20, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Determination for the Project

25 and Petitioner timely gave notice and filed suit within thirty days of the same. A true and correct

26 copy of the City's Notice of Determination is attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated by

27 reference herein.

JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

2 36. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 394, 1085, 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168 et seq. Many of

4 Petitioner's members, including Ms. Fradkin, live in the City and will be directly affected by the

5 Project's numerous impacts, including environmental impacts.

6 37. Petitioner's members, among others, submitted extensive oral and written

7 comments at all stages of the public process. By virtue of said comments, which are incorporated

8 by reference herein, Petitioner has exhausted all required administrative remedies.

9 38. Prior to filing this action, Petitioner provided all required notices, true and correct

10 copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits D and E. D

11 39. As such, Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and

12 has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
d3A3WM3N DILLION CE 13 40. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the offenses alleged in this petition
14 and thus petitions this Court for relief as prayed for herein.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Peremptory Writ of Mandate/Mandamus--Against Respondents and DOES 1-50)

17 41. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

18 40, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

19 42. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections

20 21168 and 21168.5, the California Constitution, and the City's land use regulations and local

21 ordinances.

22 43. Magnolia at the Park is considered a "project" as defined by the California Public
23 Resources Code, as it is an activity that may cause either a direct physical change in the
24 environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.

25 44. Respondents' consideration and approval of the Project constitutes "approval of a

26 project" within the meaning of CEQA.

27 45. Approval of the EIR for Magnolia at the Park was discretionary, not ministerial.

28 As such, the City was required to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project.
4516.101 / 8560319.1 . 9 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 46. By approving and certifying the EIR without providing proper project

2 description, without updating or revising related environmental analyses and mitigation measures,

3 without completing a new initial study for the effects of the changes to the Project, without

4 meaningfully responding to the public comments incorporated by reference herein, and without

5 recirculating the EIR for public comment, Respondents violated CEQA, among other local, state,

6 and federal laws, rules, and regulations.

7 47. For example, CEQA mandates recirculation of an EIR where significant new

8 information is added after public notice is given, but before certification. (See Pub. Resources

9 Code, § 21092.1; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088.5.) Here, Respondents failed to

10 recirculate the EIR in violation of CEQA. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088.5.) As a result,

11 the EIR does not adequately evaluate environmental impacts that the Project will have on the

12 surrounding community, including, without limitation, traffic, water quality, air quality, dust
H3A3WM3N DILLION 4N 13 control, and other such issues addressed in the public comments incorporated by reference herein.

14 48. Furthermore, Respondents certified the EIR and granted the other Project

15 approvals despite glaring inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and zoning regulations, in

16 violation of CEQA, the California Government Code, and the Santa Ana City Charter, which

17 incorporates the same either expressly or as a matter of statewide concern.

18 49. In this case, and as alleged above, the proposed modifications create new,

19 different, or additional environmental impacts that are either unmitigated for in the EIR or

20 entirely unaddressed. The differences between the Initial Plan and the Project give rise to

21 significant new impacts and/or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified

22 impacts. Furthermore, the EIR does not evaluate certain environmental impacts that the Project

23 will have on the surrounding community, including traffic, water quality, air quality, and dust

24 control, and other such issues addressed in the public comment incorporated by reference herein.
25 50. Petitioner, therefore, requests that this Court issue a peremptory writ of
26 mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to vacate and/or set aside the approvals discussed

27 herein, including the approvals of the EIR and related Entitlements.

28 ///

4516.101 / 8560319.1 . 10 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 51. The public interest will suffer from Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA,

2 the City's land use regulations, and the City's contracting away of its legislative powers.

3 Petitioner, therefore, requests the recovery of its attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil

4 Procedure section 1021.5.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Declaratory Relief-Against Respondents and DOES 50-100)

7 52. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

8 51, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

9 53. Actual and substantial controversies have arisen between Petitioner and

10 Respondents.

11 54. Petitioner contends that Respondents have violated CEQA and the City's land use

12 requirements.

DILLION HBA3WMEN 13 55. Petitioner contends that the City has improperly contracted away its police powers,

14 whereas Respondents contend that they have not done so.

15 56. Petitioner further contends that the Project may not proceed in light of these

16 violations and potential environmental impacts, whereas Respondents contend that the Project

17 may proceed as certified.

18 57. Based on the foregoing, without adequate remedy at law, Petitioner seeks

19 declaratory relief as further requested in the prayer herein.

20 REQUEST FOR HEARING AND BRIEFING SCHEDULE

21 58. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.4, Petitioner requests that this

22 Court notice a case management conference and establish a briefing schedule for submission of

23 points and authorities, and that a hearing on the petition be held within 30 days of filing of all

24 briefing.

25 WHEREFORE, PETITIONER prays for entry of judgment as follows:

26 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to vacate

27 and/or set aside the approval of the modifications to the Initial Plan;

Ret Magnolia at the Park Multi-Family Residential Project (the "Addington") Located at 2525 N. Main Street Final Environmental Impact Report, No: 2018-01 (SCH.No. 2018021031)

Honorable Mayor Pulido and Members of the City Council:
This office represents the Park Santiago Neighborhood Association ("PSNA"), a coalition of interested property owners located in the City of Santa Ana ("City') within the zone of impacts of the proposed residential development project commonly referred to as Magnolia at the Park Multi-Family Residential Project or the Addington, located at 2525 N. Main Street ("Project"). This letter addresses AC 2525 Main LLC's ("Applicant") appeal of the City of Santa Ana Planning Commission's ("Pianning Commission") recent: denial of the Proposed Project at its meeting on October 28, 2019.
PSNA is concerned regarding the Applicant's continued pursuit of approvals that do not conform to the policies and objectives of the City's General Plan and its efforts to do so by way of bribing adjacent property owners. In addition, the City's continued wilingness to consider a high density multi-family residential development in an area where it would not mesh raises concerns as to why the City has not asked the Applicant to consider other viable development options for the site that would not have a detrimental effect on the community and that would conform with the policies and objectives of the General
Plan.

PSNA respectfully requests that the Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council. ("City Council") affirm the Planning Commission's denial, in accordance with recommendation one in the Staff Report. PSNA submits that the Planning Commission correctly rejected the modified Project. Indeed, despite multiple revisions, the Project remains grossly inconsistent with the City of Santa Ana's General Plan and the
character of the surrounding community. At the same time, the Project documents

reveal that its impacts, environmental or otherwise, still have not been properly considered by the elected body or its constituents.
For these reasons, among others detailed more fully below, the Planning Commission's
denial must be upheld.
In addition to its written objection to any Project approval, this written comment also serves as PSNA's formal request for written notice in advance of any future meetings tegarding the City's consideration of the Project, including, without limitation, the filing of any notice of determination related to the purportedly Final Environmental Impact Report No. 2018-01 (SCH No. 2018021031) ("FEIR").
1. THE PROJECT'S HISTORY, MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS, AND THREE
DENIALS.
Jeremy Ogulnick, representing AC 2525 Main, LLO, is proposing to construct a 256-unit multi-family residential development (58 dwelling units per acre) on a 4.4-acre parcel of land at 2525 North Main Street. Additionally, the Applicant is proposing to create a second parcel to accommodaté a 180-space surface level parking lot that is proposed to
be used by the Discovery Cube on an adjacent 1.4-acre parcel. Actions required to
approve the Project include the certification and adoption of the FEIR for the development, which includes a Clarifications to the FEIR document, a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, and a statement of overriding considerations. Entitlements needed for the development include the approval of a development
agreement between the City and applicant/owner, a general plan amendment to redesignate the land use designation of the property from Professional and Administrative Office ( PAO) to District Center ( DC), and an amendment application to rezone the property from Professional (P) to Specific Development No. 93 (SD- 93).
The Project's history, compared to jts most current iteration, is quite different from when the Planning Commission first held a public hearing to consider the Applicant's then-
proposed 496-unit (84 per acre) development project on January 14, 2019. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1--2-3 [discussing Project background and various
modifications].) City staff recommended and presented a reduction in development from 496 units (84 welling units per acre [DUA]) to 476 units, 81 DUA. The Project was denied by the Planning Commission. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1-2- 3.) The City Council directed the Applicant go back to the Planning Department and Planning Commission after consultation with the community. (City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-2)
This cycle continued until the Applicant again informed City staff that it would make
further modifications before again seeking to proceed before City Council. (See City
Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1 thru 2-3.) The July 22, 2019, Planning Commission meeting was adjourned at the last minute due to no quorum. On August 12, 2019 the

4398.101 / 8604501.2

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council
November 18, 2019
Page 3

Applicant's Project of 347 units resulted in an impasse by the Planning Commission. The Applicant chose to appeal the Project to the City Council. Following this meeting and due ta extensive modifications to the Project, the City required that a modified project be presented to the Planning Commission once again.
The latest modifications have culminated in the present, unrecognizable, and rashly considered Project---a far cry from the initial Project as considered and evaluated in the FEIR. (See City Staff Rept:, Oct. 28, 2019, 2-3 thru 2-4 [modified Project in its current iteration]) The staff report identifies the modified Project will have a lot line adjustment and be bullt on 4.4 acres, with the remaining 1.4 acres to be used by a third party for surface parking, There is no mention of selling this 1.4 acres to third party in the staff report: The 4.4 acre property would still require the complete demolition of an existing two-story, 81,172 square foot office building. (See City Staff Rept, Oct. 28, 2019, 2:4, Tbl Iproject location information] see also, id. at.2-5 [discyssing demolition of existing office building].) The intensity of the proposed use and requisite Projact construction (demotition of an existing building) stands in harsh contrast to the surrounding, far less intensive land uses, including the designated open space "Santiago Park" to the north and the single family residential homes - R1 to the east and south. (See City Staff Repf., Oct. 28; 2019, 2:4, Tbl. [Project location information and adjacent uses]-)
On or about October 28, 2019, the modified Project came before the Planning Commission for the third time. (See City Stäff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1 [listing date of hearingl) The Planning Commission denied, again for a third time, approval of the Project. (See Official Video of Planning Commission Regular Meeting.)1
In its present iteration before the City Council, the Project purports to construct a 256- unit.multifamily housing project at 58 dwelling units per acre, with 511 parking späces proposed, and an additional 180 surface parking spaces on the second adjacent .lof. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1, 2-4, Tbl. 1,.2-5, passim.) However, the conditions of approval acknowledge that no joint parking agreement is in place and that there would not be one until the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy: (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-603.) Even upon issuance, it appears that any joint parking agreement would be revocable at any time and by either party. (Ibid.) Again, entitlements requested include the following:
Adoption of an ordinance approving a development agreement between the Applicant and the City, Identified as Development Agreement No. 2018-01;

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council November 18, 2019

Adoption of a resolution approving a general plan amendment to re-désignate the property from Professional & Administrative Office ("PAO") to District Center ("DC"*), identified as General Plan Amendment No. 20:18-06,
Adoption of an ordinance approving an amendment application to rezone the property from Professional ("P") to Specific Development No. 93 ("SD-93"), •despite language In Division 26 that requires any specific development to maintain the values of the surrounding properties, and,
Adoption of a resolution certifying the FEIR, including adoption of environmental findings of fact under the Callfornia Environmerital Quality Act ("CEQA"), adoption of a purported "Clarification to the Final EIR* (City Staff Rept. at p. 2-2), a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
The Project will cause a substantial and significant deprivation of the property rights of adjacent residents, For example, in public comment provided to the City Council on or about September 3, 2019, a report detailed the potential home price devaluation in the Park Santiago neighborhood that would result from the development of the proposed Project. (See City Council, Sept. 3, 2019, [public comment re Park Santiago price devaluation resulting from Project].) The Project Applicant took a unique approach in response to this apparent situation. Specifically, it appears that the Applicant solicited adjacent property owners' support by offering a substantial monetary sum (of at least $35,000) in exchange for an agreement not to object to the Project,
2. ANY CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF THE MODIFIED PROJECT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN.
As the City Council is aware, a city's general plan provides the constitution for all füture development in the City. As a practical matter no city can function without it." (See Nelson v. Carlson (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 732, 740, as modified on denial of reh'g (Aug, 27, 1993).) Indeed, the Legislature has developed a comprehensive scheme covering a general plan's development, adoption, and amendment. (See Gov. Code, § 65100 et seq.) Every city is required to prepare and adopt one. (Gov. Code, §5 65300, 65350.) A general plan must include a detailed discussion covering a city's land use, circulation, housing, conservation, noise and safefy, along with "a statement of development policies and shail include a diagram or diagrams and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals." (Gov. Code, § 65302.) Once adopted, a city's zoning ordinances must be consistent with the general plan's objectives, policies, land uses and programs. (Gov. Code, § 65860, subd. (a)(il); see also Lesher Comms., Inc. V. Gity of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d. 531, 535-536.)
As such, the alteration or amendment of a general plan should not be taken lightly. The impact on the City's residents is significant and a perceived benefit such as revenue is

4398.101 / 8504501.2.

Honorable: Mayor Pulido
Santa Ana City Council
November 18, 2019
Page 5

insufficient to justify the negative impacts of increased traffic; increased density,
incompatibility with neighboring communities, and environmental factors that would be
caused by allowing the Applicant's proposed amendment to the City's General Plan.
Moreover, the Applicant's efforts to purchase the silence of those opposed to its application should mandate denial as a matter of principal and equity.
As noted above, the Planning Commission denied approval of the Project three times, the latest on October 28, 201.9. (See Official Video of Planning Comm'n Regular Meeting.)2 In its present iteration before the City Council, the Project purports to construct a 256-unit multifamily housing project at 58 dwelling units per acre, with 5.11 parking spaces proposed and an additional 180 surface parking spaces on the second adjacent lot. (See City Staff Rept.; Oct. 28,2019, 2-1,2-4, Tbl, 1, 2-5, passim.) Also discussed above, the Project site is approximately 4.51 acres and construction thereon will require the complete demolition of an existing two-story, 81,172 square foot office building. (See City Staff Repi., Öct. 28, 2019, 2-4, Tbl. 1.) Again, the Intensity of the proposed use.stands in stark contrast to its surrounding surrounded uses, including an open space park to the north and single family residential homes to the east and south. (See ibid.)
The Project site has a current land use designation of Professional and Administrative Office, with a zoning of Professional. The allowable uses of the property are limited to professional and administrative offices, banking or finance, travel agencies, medical and
dental offices, museums oriscience centers, pharmacies, child care facilities, and freestanding regular-hours eateries. (See SÄMC, 841-313.) Other allowable uses of the property, subject to a conditional use permit, include hospitals, convalescent facilities, health clubs, trade schools, ambulance response services, late-night eateries, adult day care facilities, banquet halls, clubs or lodges, and bail bonds, (SAMC, §41- 313.5.) The maximum allowable density for the adjacent R-1 district wherein the Park Santiago neighborhood is located is low density residential (LR-7) or seven (7) dwelling units per acre, with an actual density of 4.4 dwelling units per acre. (lbid.)
The City's current General Plan does not support the approval of the Project, even in its current form. Excerpts of the relevant land use and housing elements that remain inconsistent with the proposed Project approvals are referenced below:

INCONSISTENCIES WITH LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is divided into five sections: Purpose & Scope, Community Factors, Policy Plan, Implementation Plan, and Appendix.. Excerpts of the Land Use Element relevant to this objection are cited below:

Community Factors

"A key role in shaping [the] future growth and redevelopment, the Land Use Element perpetuates positive land uses and promotes development which supports a .high quality of life throughout the community." (Land Use Element, at p.:5, emphasis added.)
"Many of the City's land use characteristics are directly related to its historia position as one of Orange County's earliest pioneer settlements." (Ibid, emphasis added.)
The City is the fitth largest city in Orange County, of which 58% of its 27.3 square miles is devoted to residential development. (ld., at p. 6.)
Policy Plan
Land Use Goal 3: "Preserve and improve the character and integrity of neighborhoods." (Land Use Element, at p: 9.)
Land Use Goal 6: "Reduce residential overcrowding to promote public health and safety: (Jhid.)

Land Use Policies

Policy 1.2: "Support high density residential development within the City's District Centers as a part of mixed use development." (Id., atp. 10.)
Policy 2.2: "Support new development which is harmonious in scale and
character with existing development in the area." (ld., at p. 11.)

Policy 3.1: "Support development which provides a positive contribution to neighborhood character and identity.' (ld., at p. 12.)
Policy 3.5: *Encourage new development and/or additions to existing development that are compatible in scale, and consistent with the
architectural style and character of the neighborhood." (Ibid, emphasis
added.)

4398.101 / 8504501.2

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Cauncil November 18, 2019
Page 7

Policy 5.2: "Protect the community from incompatible land uses." (ld., at p. 13.)
Policy 5.4: "Support land uses which are consistent with the Land Use Plan of the Land Use Element." (Ibid.)
Policy 5,5: "Encourage development which is compatible with, and supportive of surrounding land uses." (lbid.)
INCONSISTENCIES WITH HOUSING ELEMENT

The Housing Element introduces the City's housing needs and contains an analysis of resources to address those needs. (Housing Element, at p. 2.) Excerpts of the Housing Element relevant to this objection are cited below:
COMMUTE PATTERNS

"[TIhe majority of employed Santa Ana residents work outside of the City, approximately 20 percent work within the City." (Housing Element, at p. 13.)
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS

"Approximately 70 percent of all residential areas within the City are single-family residential neighborhoods. Many of these neighborhoods are established and well maintained, and several neighborhoods contain state and local historic resources." (ld., at p. 15.)
"To protect and stabilize residential neighborhoods, support the City's economic base, and provide housing for the local workforce, Santa Ana is
developing new residential neighborhoods in District Centers close to employment centers. These District Centers include the Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone, MacArthur Place, Downtown Santa Ana, City Place, and similar locations. [...] These residential neighborhoods are intensely urbanized, transit oriented, and explicitly designed to support a full array of housing needs in Santa Ana." (Ibid., emphasis added.)

AVAILABLE LAND FOR HOUSING

"The City has identified areas for future development and mixed uses within its District Centers and transit comidors. [...] The sites are specifically chosen to create distinct and vibrant activity centers linked together with a variety of transportation options." (Id., at p. 30.)

4398.101 / 8504501.2

Honorable Mayor Pülido Santa Ana City Council November 18, 2019
Page

POLICY FRAMEWORK

Policy HE-1.7: "Historic Preservation Support preservation and enhancement
of residential structures; properties, street designs, lot patterns, and other visible
reminders of neighborhoods that are considered local historical or cultural
resources." (Housing Element, at p. 43.)
Similar inconsistencies should also cause the City concern. For example, the Project contemplates publie access to the City's Santiago Park via the proposed development.
This private-to-public access creates obvious problems with respect to maintenance costs and liability, but the Project as contemplated does not appear to address those issues. Moreover, the Project documents frequently reference the Project as a District Center, although its current iteration does not contemplate a mixed-use component, a requirement of any District Center development.
For the foregoing reasons, among others, any approval of the Project would be inconsistent with and continue to violate the City's General Pian.

3. THE PROJECT APPROVAL MAY SUBJECT THE CITY TO SUBSTANTIAL
LITIGATION.

In addition to the problems with respect inconsistency with the General Plan as identified above, the Citys actions described herein may give rise to a compensable regulatory taking. Specitically, the City's approval of the Project will infentionally interfere with the property rights of the surrounding property owners, depressing the value of the properties wherein some or all economic uses of the will be impacted under the Penn Central and/or Kavanau tests. (See, e.g., Penn Central Transp. Co. V. New York City (1978) 438 U.S. 104, 123; Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 761, 771--777; see also defferson Sireet Ventures, LLC v. City of Indio
(2015) 236 Cal.App. 4th 1175:)
Evidence of this depression in value has already been provided to the City Council. (See City Council, Sept. 3, 2019, Ipublic comment re Park Santiago price devaluation resulting from Project].). In fact; on September 3, 2019, public comment provided in the formal record for the Project detailed the potential home price devaluation that would result. (lbid.) Here, the Park Santiago neighborhood consists of approximately 1100 homes at an average value of $700,000 each. If the value of these homes is depressed by even as little as 5%, or approximately $35,000, that would result in potential losses of up to $38.5 million. (See ibid.) As such, the City may have significant exposure for inverse condemnation for injury to property interests caused by the City's failure to properly and thoroughly consider the impacts of this Project on surrounding properties, although such impacts are required to be considered under Division 26 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code (SAMC"). (See Knick v. Township of

4398.101 / 8504501.2

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council
November 18, 2019
Page 9

Scolt, Pennsylvania (2019) 139 S.Ct. 2162; Landgate, Inc. v. California Coastal Comm'n (1998) 17 Cal.4th 1006, 1029.).
Further, it appears that the Applicant acknowledged these potential losses and has solicited surrounding property owners support by offering at least $35,000 to certain homeowners in exchange for their support of the Project. The City Council cannot and should not condone this conduct, as it results in a further violation of Chapter 41, which. requires that the value pf surtounding properties be maintained prior to the approval of any specific development: (SAMC, § 41-593.1.)
Failure to properly consider the impacts outlined above, among others, may subject the City to Inverse condemnation liability as a result.

4.: THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT MAY
IMPERMISSIBLY CONTRACT AWAY THE CITY'S DISCRETION.
Land use regulations involve the exercise of the police power and the right to exercise the police power cannot be contracted away. (See Richeson V. Helal (2007) 158 Cal.Ap.p.4th 268, 280-281, as modified (Dec. 21, 2007), Avco Communily Developers, Inci v: South Coast Regional Com, (1976) 17 Cal.3d 785, 800; City of Glendale V. Superior Court (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1768, 1778-1779; Delucchi v, County of Santa Cruz (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 814, 823; Carty v. City of Ojai (1978) 77 Cal.App:3d 329. 342-343.) If a contract cannot be read harmoniously with the police power, the contract would be unconstitutional as "contracting away" the City's sovereign police power.
(Delucchi v. County of Santa Crüz, supra, at pp. 823-824.)
Although a development agreement itself operates as a legislative act and not necessarily a contract, it is subject to the principles expressed above. In Save Tara V:
City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 130-132, the Court struck down a similar
project by finding that the city violated CEQA because it had impermissibly committed itself to the project before completing an adequate CEQA review. When a public agency gives a project "approval" it "commits to a definite course of action in regard to a project." (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 1532, subd. (a).)
Because the proposed development agreement can be read to unconditionally commit to an approval without first attaining CEQA compliance and without proper preservation
of the City's police powers, any related Project approval may be held invalid.

5. IF THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES THE PROJECT AS IS, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE BY REFERENDUM.

If the City Council approves the Project in its current state, the support of ten percent or more of the registered voters will be easily attainable for a referendum of the legislative entitlements. The City's own staff report supports this, as it repeatedly references the

4398:101/ 8504501.2

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council
November 18, 2019
Page 10

number of opponents as early as the initial notice of proceeding, which received 163 comment letters. For example, on August 27, 2018, the Planning Commission conducted a work-study session to overview the Project. As part of this session, the Planning Commission received numerous comments, Jargely opposed, including thirty- two (32) verbal comments, with three (3) in support and twenty-nine (29) in opposition; and nine (9) written comments, with one (1) in support and eight (8) in opposition.
The opponents to the Project have only increased over time. At the Jatest Planning Commission meeting on October 28, 2019, sixty-two (62) speakers expressed opposition and only two (2) expressed support of the project. In addition, ninety-eight (98) individuals submitted written comments, with ninety-four (94) in opposition and only four (4) in support.
Upon submittal of any such referendum, the City will have a mandatory duty to process and sübmit any such initiative and referendom measures. (Duran V. Cassidy (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d. 574 [city clerk]; Elec. Code, $.4008; Farley v. Healey (1967) 67 Cal,2d 325 [charter of the City and County of San Franciscol; Elec. Code, § 180; see also Yost v. Thomas (1984) 36 Cal.3d:561, 564, fn. 2;). The cost to the City and its taxpayers to process such a referendum could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,

6. THE CITY COUNCIL CANNOT APPROVE THE PROUECT BECAUSE OF A
FAILURE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE NOTICE.

The requirement for meaningful notice and an opportunlty to be heard extend to rezonings and other legislative acts. This is particularly true where property rights are affected. As noted above, the value of the impact to the neighboring homes may be substantial. Thus, adjacent properties are entitled to due process notice.
The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires "at a minimum ... that
deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing..." (Mullane v. Central Hanover Co. (1950) 339 U.S. 306, 313.) The "root requirement" of due process is "that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest." (Scott v. City of Indian Weils (1972) 6 Cal.3d 541, 548-549; Boddie v, Connecticut (1971) 401 U.S. 371, 379.) Notice and an opportunity to be heard are prerequisites. (Anderson Nat. Bank V.. Luckett (1944) 321 U.S. 233, 240-247; Hom v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612-615; Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 517; Kennedy v. City of Hayward (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 953.)
State and local law therefore require valid notice of the hearing be given to nearby property owners. (Gov. Code, §§ 65901, 65905; FCZO, § 877(B)(5)(c).) For notice to be valid, "notice must, at a minimum, be reasonably calculated to afford affected
persons the realistic opportunity to protect their interests. [Citations.I" (Horn v. County of

4398.101 / 8504501.2

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council
November 18, 2019
Page 11

Ventura, supra.: 24 Cal.3d at p. 617.) Several cases have held that to be adequate "the notice must be such as would according to common experience be reasonably adequate to the purpose." (See, e.g., Kennedy v. South Coast Regional Com., supra, 68 Cal.App.3d at pp. 670-672; Litchfield v, Counly of Marin (1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 806, 813; Scott v. City of Indian Wells (1972) 6 Cal.3d 541, 548-549; Drum V. Fresno County Dept. of Public Works (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d. 777, 782-783.)
Consistently, the SAMC; likewise acknowledges the requirement for valid notice to adjacent property owners. Section 41-645 governs the City Council's review of the Planning Commission's denial of the proposed Project. (See Code 1952, § 9250.14; Ord. No. NS-455, S 1, 6-20-60; Ord. No. NS-521, § 18, 6-19-61; Ord. No. NS-989, § 1, 11-17-69; Ord. No. NS-2847, § 43, 8-5-13; Ord. No. NS-2923, § .9, 9-16-17 adding §:41-
645 to: SAMC).) Section 41-465, subdivision (g) limits the scope of the City Council's determinations on appeal as within the limitations imposed by this chapter" with specific reference to Chapter 41, Zoning:
The council, or in the case of a zoning administrator appeal, the planning commission, may, after public hearing, affirm, reverse, change, modify theroriginal decision and may make: any addilional determination it shall consider appropriate within the limitations imposed by this chapter. Such decision shall be filed with the clerk of the council, and the city planning department; one (1) copy thereof shall be sent to the applicant.
(SAMC, § 41-645, subd. (g).) Along those lines, all provisions of Chapter 41 must be interpreted and applied as, not the ceiling, but the basic "minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, and general welfare." § (Code 1952, § 9281; Ord. No. NS-455, § 1, 6-20-60 adding § 41-766 to SAMC.)
As part of those express "limitations imposed by" Chapter 41, the City Council's ability to approve plans for a development project like the Project here are contingent on its
providing of adequate notice. (See SAMC. § 41-672, subd. (a).) Specifically,
"whenever approval of plans for a development project will constitute a substantial or significant deprivation of property rights of other landowners[)" as it will here. (See ibid.) Such an approval is invalid unless the director of planning and development services has set the matter for public hearing and provided valid notice at least five (5)
days prior to the date of the hearing. (See ibid.) Valid notice must include "notice of the
time and place of the hearing to all persons, including businesses, corporations, or other public or private entities, shown on the last equalized assessment roll, as owning real
property within three hundred (300) feet of the property which is the subject of the application." (See ibid.) Moreover, the notice "shall be given by direct mailing to the owners at least five (5) days prior to the date of the hearing." (See ibid.)

Finally, notice regarding the City Council's potential action on a matter that required the a recommendation from the Planning Commission cannot be given until after the Planning Commission has issued its recommendation. .Failure to do so tesults ln inadequate hotice under established law. Here, only the staff report contained the recommendation from the Planning Commission-not the earlier. defective notice, As the courts have explained, notice without those recommendations is patently insufficient:
As we will explain, section 65856 is silent on the timing of the notice and therefore creates an ambiguity as to when, in relation the planning commission's recommendation, the notlce may be given. As we will further explain, a construction of section 65856's notice provision is inextricably bound with what must be included in that notice, a question that must be answered by looking to section 65094, which states that the contents of that notice must Include a "general explanation of the matter to be: considered." Consistent with the purpöse behind the Planning and Zoning Law, we will interpret the phrase
"general explanation of the matter to be considered" to
include the planning commission's recommendation, Therefore, notice of a legislative body's hearing cannot be given until the planning commission has made a
recommendation on the matter under consideration.
(Environmental Defense Project of Sierra County v. County of Sierra (2008): 158 Cal.Äpp.4th 877, 888, as modified (Jan. 9, 2008).)
Because inaccurate notice is akin to no notice at all, the Project cannot go forward on
the defective notice issued without the requisite recommendations from the Planning
Commission. (Drum.v. Fresno. County Dept. of Public Works, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at
p. 783.)

7. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND REQUEST FOR WRITTEN NOTICE.
For the foregoing reasons, among others, PSNA respectfully requests that the City
Council deny the proposed Project, consistent with the Planning Commission's recommendation. Additionally, PSNA reserves its rights to submit further public comment at and up to the close of the record on the Project and requests formal, written
notice in advance of any future meetings or notices of determination related to the
Project.

Res Magnolia at the Park Multi-Family Residential Project (the "Addington") Located at 2525 N. Main Street
Final Environmental Impact Report, No. 2018-01 (SCH No, 2018021031)

Honorable Mayor Pulido and Members of the City Council:
On behalf of the Park Santiago Neighborhood Association ("PSNA"), a coalition of interested property located in the City of Santa Ana ("City"), and in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), we submit this written comment for
consideration and inclusion in the administrative record in advance of tonight's hearing on the proposed residential development project commonly referred to as Magnolia at: the Park Mult-Family Residential Project or the Addington, located at 2525 N. Main Street ("Project"). This evening, the Santa Ana City Council ("City Council") must consider, after the Planning Commission's denial, the Project's proposed entitlements
and certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report, No. 2018-01 (SCH No,
2018021031) ("FEIR").
PSNA respectfully requests that the Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council affirm the Planning Commission's denial in accordance with recommendation one, both on the grounds outlined in PSNA's November 18, 2019, letter and on the grounds detailed herein. PSNA submits that the Planning Commission correctly rejected the hastily modified Project, including its FEIR. Indeed, it is the City's responsibility to
independently ensure that the FEIR meets CEQA's requirements. The City, as lead agency, must guarantee that the FEIR sufficiently identifies and mitigates for the Project's significant environmental impacts. There is no excuse for the City's failure to do so, As such, the City Council should reject the proposed entitlements and uphold the Planning Commission's decision, as they are inconsistent with the policies of the City's General Plan ("General Plan") and are not supported by a legally adequate FEIR.

The FEIR is insufficient in many ways. The FEIR is legally inadequate because the Project description incorporates significant new informatión without providing an opportunity for meaningful public review and comment. At the same time, the FEIR still fails to meaningfully address or respond to many of the 163 written comments. Thus, the City Council should take no action on the FEIR, prepare its own, independent EIR, and, at the very least, recirculate the FEIR to allow an opportunity for truly meaningful public comment.
If the City certifies this FEIR as-is, it will remain subject to significant challenge. The City may base its decision not to certify the FEIR on ite failure to comply with standards governing the legal adequacy of EIRs generally. It may also determine that the FEIR is inadequate because revisions to the FEIR are required to respond to changes to the Project, changes in circumstances, or new information arising after the FEIR was completed. At the very least, the FEIR should be recirculated for proper public comment before it is certified.
In addition to its written objection to any Project approval, this written comment also serves as PSNA's formal request for written notice in advance of any future meetings regarding the City's consideration of the Project, including, without limitation, the filing of any notice of determination related to the FEIR.

1. THE PROJECT'S HISTORY, MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS, AND SOLICITATION OF SURROUNDING RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OWNERS FOR THEIR SUPPORT.

The Project's history, compared to its most current iteration, is quite different from when the Planning Commission first held a public hearing to consider the Applicant's then- proposed 496-unit (84 per acre) development project. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1-2-3 [discussing Project background and various modifications].) City staff recommended a reduction in development density and denial of the Project as it was then proposed. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1-2-3.) The City Council agreed and the Applicant modified the Project: (City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1-2-3.) This cycle continued until the Applicant again informed City staff that it would make further modifications before again seeking to proceed before City Council. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1-2-3.)
The latest modifications have culminated in the present, unrecognizable and rashly considered Project--a far cry from the initial Project as considered and evaluated in the FEIR. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-3-2-4 [modified Project in its current iteration].) The modified Project remains on approximately 5.93 acres of property and would still require the complete demolition of an existing two-story, 81,172 square foot office building. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-4, Tbl. 1 [project location information]; see also, id. at p. 2-5 [discussing demolition of existing office building].) The intensity of the proposed use and requisite Project construction (demolition of an

3917.101 / 8509864.1

Honorable Mayor Pulido
Santa Ana City Council
November 19, 2019

existing building) stands in harsh contrast to the surrounding, far less intensive land uses, including the designated open space "Santiago Park" to the north and the single family residential homes - R1 to the east and south. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-4, Tbl. 1 [Project location information and adjacent uses].)
On or about October 28, 2019, the modified Project came before the Planning Commission for review. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1 [listing date of hearing]) The Planning Commission dented approval of the Project. (See Official. Video of Planning Comm'n Regular Meeting.)1
In its present iteration before the City Councit, the Project purports to construct a 256-
unit multifamily housing project at 58 dwelling units per acre, with 180 surface parking spaces proposed. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-1, 2-4, Tbl. 1, 2-5, passim.) Entitlements requested include the following:

• Adoption of an ordinance approving a development agreement between the Applicant and the City, identified as Development Agreement No. 2018-01;

• Adoption of a resolution approving a general plan amendment to re-designate the property from Professional & Administrative Office ("PAO") to: District Center ("DC"), identified as General Plan Amendment No, 2018-06;

• Adoption of an ordinance approving an amendment application to rezone the property from Professional (P") to Specific Development No. 93 ("SD-93"), despite language in Division 26 that requires any specific development to maintain the values of the surrounding properties; and,
Adoption of a resolution certifying the FEIR, including adoption of environmental findings of fact under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), adoption of a purported "Clarification to the Final EIR" (City Staff Rept. at p. 2-2), a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
The Project will cause a substantial and significant deprivation of the property rights of adjacent residents and businesses. For example, in public comment provided to the City Council on or about September 3, 2019, a report detailed the potential home price devaluation in the Park Santiago neighborhood that would result from the development of the proposed Project. (See City Council, Sept. 3, 2019, [public comment re Park Santiago price devaluation resulting from Project]) The Project Applicant took:a unique approach in response to this apparent situation. Specifically, it appears that the Applicant solicited surrounding property owners' support by offering a substantial

monetary sum (up to $35,000) in exchange for an agreement not to object to the
Project.,

2. THE FEIR'S PROJECT DESCRIPTION MAY BE INADEQUATE, RESULTING IN SIMILARLY FLAWED ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES.
An environmental impact report, commonly referred to as an "EIR," is at the heart of CEQA. (See 14 Calk Code Regs., § 15124.) A proper EIR provides the public and governmental decision-makers with detailed information on a projeot's likely environmental effects, describes the ways of minimizing such effects, and considers potential alternatives to a project. (Pub. Resources Code, §9 21002.1, 21061, 21100.)
An accurate project description "is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo v. City of L.A. (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193, 199 (hereafter County of Inyo):) When a proposed project is accompanied by an inaccurate or incomplete description, It undermines OEQA by drawing "a red herring across the path of publio input." (/d. at pp. 193, 199,) A court will reject an EIR with an incomplete or inaccurate project description because, as the court stated in County of Inyo v. City of L.A.t

Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal's
benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e., the "no project alternative") and weigh other alternatives in the balance.

(ld. at p: 198.)
Becaüse: CEQA defines "project" as "the whole of an action." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15378; see Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 2.13 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1297; Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App. 4th 1209, 1220 (hereafter Bänning Ranch)), an EIR must also describe the entire proposed project-not a piecemeal version. (East Sacramento Partnership for a Livable City v. City of Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th.281, 293; Banning Ranch, 211 Cal.App.4th at p. 1222; Communities for a Better Envt. v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 98.) A project description must include future expansion or later phases of a project that will foreseeably result from project approval. (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376 (hereafter Laurel Heights); 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15126 [EIR's impact analysis must consider all phases of project].) Additionally, an EIR's project description must be internally consistent. If not, it cannot provide a vehicle for informed public participation in the decision-making process. (County of Inyo, 71 Cal.App.3d at p. 197 [shifting EIR description from
groundwater pumping to replacing the entire aqueduct system].)

3917.101 / 8509864:1

Honorable Mayor Pulido
Santa Ana City Council November 19, 2019
Page 5

Here, the Project proposes a large-scale planned residential development that violates the General Plan as discussed in detail in our letter regarding the same, dated Noyember 18, 2019. Moreover, under the terms of the existing entitlements and the existing Project description in the FEIR, the Project is capable of a much higher maximum density than that being considered in the environmental review. As such, the Project description may be inaccurate because it fails to identify, and thus properly consider, changes to the existing land use designations and the maximum allowable density based on the proposed entitlements to the same.

3, THE FEIR MAY IMPROPERLY ASSUME A POST-DEVELOPMENT BASELINE.
The idea of a "baseline" in the context of the FEIR is fundamental to its legitimacy. Asa general matter, a baseline is important in part because it operates as the starting point by which all future comparisons are made. Jt follows that an EIR, like the FEIR here, which purports to report the environmental impacts ofa proposed project, must start at the beginning, In other words, the baseline used as the yardstick by which relative change is measured must, itself, be a sound source for comparison.
Experts explain the concept of a false baseline as the shifting "waistline" problem. For many of the same reasons, it would be difficult to determine weight loss if the starting scale measured you 30 pounds underweight, An EIR is likewise of little value if potential impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures are evaluated relative to a false or shifting starting point. CEQA acknowledges this by defining how a project must delermine its baseline, According to Title 14 Section 15125(a), a baseline condition must reflect the existing conditions, applicable plan designations, and zoning for the Project area in effect. Yet, the FEIR's impact analyses and conclusions are often based on the assumed approval of the underlying entitlements it purports to evaluate. Similar issues exist throughout the FEIR, as well as just in the Project description.
Separately, the Project fails to properly consider its impacts relative to the applicable general, regional, and specific plans. (14 Cal. Code Regs., §15125, subd. (d).) Ultimately, CEQA requires an evaluation of the Project in its existing environmental and regulatory setting-not in a vacuum. Accordingly, an EIR must discuss and evaluate inconsistencies between the proposed Project and its applicable general, specific, and regional plans. (Ibid. ["applicable" plans have been adopted and legally apply to a proposed project].)
Here, existing land use designations allow for a much lower maximum density for the entire Project area. This lower density is consistent with the applicable general, regional, and specific plans, but entirely inconsistent with the high-density development proposed by this Project. Thus, because the FEIR evaluates the Project against a false or shifting baseline that is inconsistent with existing baseline conditions, the resulting analyses likewise fail, likely rendering the FEIR legally insufficient.

4. ULTIMATELY, THE CITY MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INADEQUATE FEIR.

CEQA compliance must occur before the City approves the Project. When a public a agency gives a project "approval" it "commits to a definite course of action in regard to a project." (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 1532, subd. (a).) In Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 130-132, the Court struck down a project, finding that the city violated CEQA because it had impermissibly committed itself to. the project before completing an adequate CEQA review. While an applicant's consultant may prepare an EIR, that does not relieve the City from its independent duty to review and exercise judgment over the document: Indeed, the City must independently review, evaluate, and exercise judgment over the document and the issues It raises and addresses. (Friends of La Vina v. County of Los Angeles (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1446, 1452; Pub. Res. Code, 8 21082.1.) Ultimately, the City will be the one left holding the bag for certification of an inadequate EIR. (Mission Oaks Ranch, Ltd. v. County of Santa Barbara (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 713, 723-724.)
Here, the adequacy of the FEIR's Project description is inextricably linked to the adequacy of its analyses of environmental effects. If the description, baseline, and consistency requirements are not metthe resulting environmental analyses will be similarly flawed. (See Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d 376 [EIR failed to describe or analyze project accurately]) For example, if an EIR bases its cumulative impact analyses on general plan projections, it must explain why these projections function as a realistic predictor of related impacts. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15130, subd. (b)(1)(B).) Moreover, a general plan's projections of future growth and related impacts are an inadequate basis for an EIR's cumulative impact analysis if the plan's projections do not cover a sufficiently wide area or exclude relevant data. (See Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App. 3d 692 [no explanation of why analysis of cumulative air quality impacts was limited to Central Valley]; Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v: County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421 [air quality analysis defective for failure to include contributión to pollution from offshore oil operations].)
This is particularly true in situations like those at issue here, where the Project was. originally envisioned at a higher density. Because the FEIR may rely on inaccurate estimates of projected development density, the analyses that flow from that estimate may be similarly flawed.
In addition to the potential issues identified in this comment and the various additional comments submitted, the FEIR also may fail to identify, discuss, or mitigate potential significant impacts in the transportation and circulation section. For example, back-up of southbound traffic on N. Main Street between Edgewood Road and Walkie Way has the potential to significantly increase traffic and block intersections. The Project is proposing to reduce the distance between these intersections, while adding traffic to the back-up of traffic. In the technical studies for the project, information is calculated that

3917.101 / 8509864.1

Honorable Mayor Pulido
Santa Ana City Council
November 19, 2019
Page 7

shows this back-up increasing into the future, but it was not evaluated or mitigated in the report text. This is important especially considering the overly wide intersection being created with the project at Walkie Way.
Once the FEIR is revised to include an accurate Project description, then additional substantive issues may be raised and addressed. PSNA reserves its right to submit supplemental information and evidence up to the final public hearing on the Project. (See, e.g., Galante Vineyards v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management (1997) 60

UL* mi Cal.App.4th 1109, 1119-1120 [applicant has right to present comments "prior to the close of the public hearing on the project."): Coal. for Student Action V. City of Fullerion (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1194, 1197 [same principle].)
5. THE FEIR SHOULD BE RECIRCULÄTED BECAUSE IT INCLUDES
SIGNIFICANT NEW INFORMATION.
An EIR must be recirculated if significant new information is added, in which case, further public and agency review is required. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21092.1; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15088,5.) The Public Resources Code says the following with respect to mandatory circulation prior to certification:
When significant new information is added to an
environmental impact report after notice has been given
pursuant to Section 21092 and consultation has occurred pursuant fo Sections 21104 and 21153, but prior to
certification, the public agency shall give. notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and 21153 before certifying the environmental impact report.
(Pub. Resources Code, § 21092.1.)
New information is "significant" where the EIR has changed in a way that deprives the
public of a meaningful opportunity to comment. (See Spring Valley Lake Assn. v. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 106-109 [finding the revisions to the air quality analysis and hydrology and water quality impact analysis "problematic"] (hereafter "Spring Valley") [citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn: v. Regents of University of 6 California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1129 (hereafter "Laurel Heights /M)] ['the California Supreme Court] held that new information is 'significant, within the meaning of section 21092:1, only if as a result of the additional information 'the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect.' (Accord, [Guidelines], § 15088.5, subd. (a).)"].)

3917.101 / 8509864.1.

Honorable Mayor Pulido
Santa Ana City Council
November 19, 2019
Page 8

For example, the Spring Valley Court found revisions to the air quality impacts analysis, as well as the hydrology and water quality impact analyses "problematic," as the new analyses constituted significant new information requiring recirculation under Section 21902.1. (Spring Valley, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at pp. 108~109.) As to the air quality impacts analysis, the revisions analyzed the project's consistency with several general
plan air quality policies and implementation measures. The Court found as follows with respect to the new information on air quality
As there is insufficient evidence to support the City's finding

•:M1 the project is consistent with these two implementation
measures (see pt. I, ante), the information discloses a
substantial adverse environmental effect.
(Id. atp. 108.) Ultimately, the Court found that the revisions constituted significant new information requiring recirculation because their "breadth, complexity, and purpose" deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on an ostensibly feasible
way to mitigate a substantial, adverse environmental effect. (Id at'pp. 108-109; see also Save our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99; 107 (hereafter"Save our Peninsula") I'We conclude that the EIR in this case did not comply with CEQA in its treatment of several critical water issues. Because of these inadequacies, the Board's action certifying the EIR and approving the project constituted an abuse of discretion."): Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V, City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th.412,421, as modified (Apr. 18, 2007) [finding that the Draft EIR must be revised and recirculated for public
comment]:)
Similarly here, the FEIR incorporates substantial and significant new information and
analyses that must be allowed to undergo further public review. For example, the FEIR. for the first time appears to include an Arborist Report as a designed mitigation measure with respect to the existing mature trees that the Project proposes to remove. (See City
Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7; see also, id. at p. 2-38 [proposed statement of findings discussing certain Project Design Features "PDFs" that will be implemented like mitigation measures based on the Arborist Report].) This additional measure also purportedly identifies eight trees in an unhealthy condition recommended for removal. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7.) The City also acknowledges that this removal will require further review by the Environmental and Transportation Advisory Committee, but that it "will occur at a later date[.)" (See a City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-7.) But, CEQA contemplates a full and complete environmental review that occurs prior to action
on the Project--not at some later date after the environmental document has already been certified. If the latter were true, CEQA would be rendered meaningless.
Moreover, as the statement of overriding considerations acknowledges, the site could be used by one-special-status wildlife species: the western mastiff bat. (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-57 [draft statement of overriding considerations].) In fact, the

3917.101 / 8509864.1

Honorable Mayor Pulido Santa Ana City Council
November 19, 2019
Page 9

species has a "the site could be used by one special-status wildlife species, the western mastiff bat, that has a low potential to roost in the large trees and palms[,J' many of which are being removed for the first time in the FEIR due to a new mitigation measure and Arborist's Report designating certain existing trees and palms as unhealthy and qualified for removal, (See City Staff Rept., Oct. 28, 2019, 2-57 [draft statement of overriding considerations].) Overall, the FEIR fails to adequately address significant concerns raised by state and federal agencies, independent scientists, conservation. organizations, tribal representatives, and members of the public directly affected by this new mitigation measure. As a result of these and other related deficiencies, the FEIR may fail to fully inform the public and decision-makers of the Project's significant environmental impacts and to analyze and/or mitigate these impacts in accordance with
CEQA.

Failing to recirculate given these changes to the most significant and unavoidable impacts would result in an inability of the public or agencies to meaningfully comment on the Project's environmental impacts, The City should thus allow the FEIR to be: recirculated and evaluated.

6. CONCLUSION.

The adequacy of an EIR's project description is inextricably linked to the adequacy of its analyses of environmental effects. If the description, baseline, and consistency requirements are not met, the resulting environmental analyses will reflect the same mistakes. This is particularly true in situations like those at issue here, where the Project as originally envisioned is entirely different from the one presently before the City Council. Once a new EIR is prepared, then additional substantive issues may be raised and addressed. PSNA reserves its rights to submit further public comment at and up to the close of the record on the Project and requests formal, written notice in
advance of any future meetings or notices of determination related tö the Project. For the foregoing reasons, among others, PSNA respectfully requests that the City Council deny the proposed Project, consistent with the Planning Commission's recommendation. below.
