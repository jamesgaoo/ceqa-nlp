VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the June 24, 2020 decision of the County of San Diego, its
3 Board of Supervisors, and its Planning and Development Services department (collectively,
4 "County" or "Respondents") to approve a Transportation Study Guide and associated thresholds

5 of significance for evaluation of transportation impacts (the "SB 743 Implementation Project" or

6 "Project") under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

7 2. The Legislature enacted Senate Bill 743 in 2013 in order to change the way the
8 transportation impacts of development are addressed under CEQA. After SB 743, rather than
9 focusing on measures of traffic congestion and delay, agencies must address vehicle miles
10 traveled ("VMT") or other measures that better elucidate and reduce the climate, air quality, and
11 other impacts of vehicle travel.

12 3. SB 743 supports California's broader climate goals by ensuring that analysis and
13 mitigation of environmental impacts under CEQA will aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
14 from the transportation sector, the state's largest source of climate pollution. Indeed, the
15 California Air Resources Board has found that without significant reductions in VMT, achieving
16 California's climate goals will be impossible.

17 4. The SB 743 Implementation Project runs directly counter to the state legislation it
18 purports to implement. Rather than require analysis of future projects' contribution to VMT in
19 accordance with SB 743, the Project will create sweeping exemptions from VMT analysis
20 requirements. And rather than reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental
21 impacts from vehicle travel as the Legislature directed, the Project will facilitate increased
22 greenhouse gas emissions and other adverse transportation-related effects from future
23 development projects without any disclosure, analysis, or mitigation.

24 5. Under CEQA, "thresholds of significance" are intended to aid agencies in
25 determining whether particular environmental impacts of a project should be considered
26 "significant," and thus subject to heightened environmental analysis, mitigation, and avoidance
27 requirements. The County's VMT thresholds, in contrast, are not designed to help determine
28 whether environmental impacts from transportation are significant under CEQA. Rather, the
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County's thresholds appear to have been designed to exempt as much County development as
2 possible from any requirement to evaluate or mitigate transportation impacts.
3 6. The County created this massive and unlawful exemption from CEQA's and SB

4 743's requirements in two ways.

5 7. First, the County established a threshold of significance under which projects with

6 VMT 15% below the existing regional average would be considered to have less-than-
7 significant impacts. But the County manipulated the average regional baseline against which a
8 project's VMT would be compared. Rather than using average VMT across the highly
9 connected, integrated San Diego region as expert state technical guidance recommended, the
10 County instead used a much higher average VMT baseline derived exclusively from largely
11 rural unincorporated areas. The County thus inflated the baseline against which the 15%
12 reduction threshold must be compared. Because the baseline is so much higher, future projects
13 with higher VMT will fall below the County's thresholds-and those projects' transportation-
14 related impacts will never be analyzed or mitigated under CEQA.
15 8. Second, the County adopted an unsupported "screening threshold" for purportedly
16 small projects. Under this threshold, the County concluded that all of the residential
17 development in unincorporated rural and semi-rural areas areas where vehicle trips reasonably
18 could be expected to be the longest-would be "small" and thus exempt from VMT analysis and
19 mitigation.
20 9. Together, the County's thresholds could exempt the vast majority of the potential
21 residential units that could be developed under the County's General Plan from any
22 transportation impacts analysis whatsoever.

23 10. Adding insult to injury, the County refused to analyze the environmental
24 consequences of adopting these sweeping exemptions. Instead, the County found the SB 743
25 Implementation Project itself exempt from CEQA, based on a series of dubious rationalizations
26 that lack legal and evidentiary support.
27 11. The County's actions not only violate CEQA, but also directly undermine the clear
28 intent and direction of the Legislature in SB 743 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts of vehicle travel. The SB 743 Implementation Project is contrary to law and

2 unsupported by substantial evidence. Its adoption was a clear abuse of discretion and must be set

3 aside.

4 PARTIES

5 12. Petitioner and Plaintiff Cleveland National Forest Foundation ("CNFF") is a

6 nonprofit corporation dedicated to preserving the plants, animals and other natural resources of
7 Southern California mountains by protecting the land and water they need to survive. CNFF is
8 committed to sustainable regional land use planning in San Diego County in order to stem the
9 tide of urban encroachment on wildlands. Members of CNFF are residents and taxpayers of San
10 Diego County who will be adversely affected by the SB 743 Implementation Project's
11 significant environmental impacts. CNFF submitted written comments to the County objecting
12 to and commenting on the SB 743 Implementation Project and related approvals.
13 13. Petitioner and Plaintiff Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation ("CERF") is a
14 non-profit public benefit corporation organized under the laws of the State of California with its
15 office located in Encinitas, California. CERF was founded by surfers in North San Diego
16 County and is active throughout California's coastal communities. CERF was established to
17 advocate for the protection and enhancement of coastal natural resources and the quality of life
18 for coastal residents. Members of CERF are residents and taxpayers of San Diego County who
19 will be adversely affected by the SB 743 Implementation Project's significant environmental
20 impacts. CERF submitted written comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the
21 SB 743 Implementation Project and related approvals.

22 14. The interests that CNFF and CERF (together, "Petitioners") seek to further in this
23 action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners and their members
24 have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with laws bearing on the SB 743
25 Implementation Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project,
26 which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and which would cause substantial harm to
27 Petitioners' members, the natural environment, public health, and the quality of life in the
28 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
2 harms alleged herein.

3 15. Respondent and Defendant County of San Diego is, and at all times herein
4 mentioned was, a political subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and
5 controlling land use within the County, including but not limited to implementing and
6 complying with the provisions of CEQA as well as other state and local laws. The County is the
7  "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with principal
8 responsibility for conducting environmental review of proposed actions. The County has a duty

9 to comply with CEQA and state law.

10 16. Respondent and Defendant Board of Supervisors of the County of San Diego is,
11  and at all times herein mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent
12 County. As the decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors was charged with
13 responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's
14 environmental impacts and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project. The Board
15 also is and was responsible for implementing and complying with CEQA, including the
16 provisions of SB 743, in connection with land use planning and development projects occurring
17 in the County. The Board and its members are sued in their official capacities.

18 17. Respondent and Defendant County of San Diego Planning and Development
19 Services ("PDS") is listed as the "Project Applicant" on the County's July 9, 2020 Notice of
20 Exemption related to the Project. Based on information found at a website maintained by PDS,
21 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that PDS is "responsible for long
22 range land use planning, including the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, which
23 determine how our communities will grow. The department analyzes privately initiated land use
24 projects to ensure compliance with land use regulations, and advises the Board of Supervisors
25 and Planning Commission on the projects."I

18. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and
2 Defendants Does - through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are
informed and believe, and on that basis allege, the fictitiously named respondents are also

4 responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of
these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the

6 Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

7 19. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities, whether individual,
8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Doe 11 through Doe 40, inclusive,
0 and therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon
10 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some
11 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material interests affected
12 by the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. Petitioners will amend this
13 Petition to show their true names and capacities if and when the same have been ascertained.

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 20. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1060, 1085, 1087, and
16 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County

r remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably
2 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and their
3 members for that harm.

4 29. This petition is timely filed pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167(d)
5 and Judicial Council Emergency Rule 9 (as amended May 29, 2020).
STATEMENT OF FACTS
SB 743 and Vehicle Miles Traveled

30. The County's action purports to implement-but fails to comply with-Senate
9 Bill 743 ("SB 743"), codified at Public Resources Code section 21099.

10 31. SB 743 directed the Office of Planning and Research to prepare and develop, and
11 the California Natural Resources Agency to certify and adopt, guidelines establishing criteria for
12 determining the significance of transportation impacts under CEQA. The legislation provided
13 that transportation impacts should be evaluated in terms of vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") or
14 similar metrics, rather than "levels of service" or other measures of vehicular capacity or
15 roadway congestion. (See Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b)(1), (2).)
16 32. The Legislature specifically directed that transportation significance criteria "shall
17 promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal
18 transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses." (Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b).)
19 33. The Office of Planning and Research developed guidelines and criteria in response
20 to SB 743 and transmitted the guidelines to the California Natural Resources Agency. In late
21 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency promulgated those guidelines and criteria by
22 adding a new section 15064.3 to the CEQA Guidelines 3

23 34. Under SB 743, local agencies like the County retain authority to establish their
24 own thresholds of significance for analyzing VMT, but only to the extent that those thresholds
25 are "more protective of the environment" than the state guidelines require. (Pub. Resources
26 Code § 21099(e).)

27 References to the "CEQA Guidelines" are to the California Code of Regulations, title 14,
28 section 15000 et seq.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 35. In December 2018, contemporaneously with the promulgation of CEQA
2 Guidelines section 15064.3, the Office of Planning and Research published a document entitled

3 "Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts in CEQA" ("Technical Advisory").

4 The Technical Advisory provided "technical recommendations regarding assessment of VMT,
5 thresholds of significance, and mitigation measures." (Technical Advisory at 1.)

6 36. The Technical Advisory explained that VMT analysis and mitigation are critical to
7 achievement of California's legislatively mandated targets for greenhouse gas emissions
8 reduction. Indeed, "it will not be possible to achieve the State's 2030 and post-2030 emissions
9 goals without reducing VMT growth." (Technical Advisory at 2.)
10 37. The Technical Advisory further explained that necessary reductions in VMT can
11 occur under CEQA through identification of significant VMT impacts and adoption of
12 mitigation measures to reduce VMT. (Technical Advisory at 2-3.)
13 38. The Technical Advisory stressed that in evaluating VMT, "[I]ead agencies should
14 not truncate any VMT analysis because of jurisdictional or other boundaries, for example, by
15 failing to count the portion of a trip that falls outside the jurisdiction or by discounting the VMT
a 16 from a trip that crosses a jurisdictional boundary." (Technical Advisory at 6.)

17 39. The Technical Advisory recommended thresholds of significance for use in
18 determining whether specific projects may have significant transportation impacts, and thus
19 require VMT mitigation, under CEQA. Specifically, the Office of Planning and Research
20| "recommend[ed] using quantitative VMT thresholds linked to [greenhouse gas] reduction targets
21 when methods exist to do so." (Technical Advisory at 8.)
22 40. Informed by a quantitative assessment by the California Air Resources Board
23 evaluating the degree of VMT reduction necessary to meet the State's long-term climate goals,
24 the Technical Advisory concluded that project with per capita or per employee VMT that is
25 15% below that of existing development may reasonably be found not to have a significant a
26 transportation impact. (Technical Advisory at 10-12, 15.)
27 41. The Technical Advisory concluded that "existing" VMT "may be measured as
28 regional VMT per capita or as city VMT per capita." (Technical Advisory at 15.)
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

42. The Technical Advisory used the term "region" synonymously with the "areas"
2 subject to metropolitan planning organization jurisdiction. (Technical Advisory at 15.)
43. In San Diego County, the relevant metropolitan planning organization is the San
Diego Association of Governments ("SANDAG"), and the relevant "region" is the San Diego

5 region encompassed by SANDAG's regional transportation plan.
44. For residential projects in unincorporated areas, the Technical Advisory stated that
7 the project's VMT can be compared to either "(1) the region's VMT per capita, or (2) the
8 aggregate population-weighted VMT per capita of all cities in the region." (Technical Advisory

9 at 15.)

10 45. The Technical Advisory also discussed a possible "screening threshold" for
11 | "smaller projects," under which projects generating fewer than 110 average daily trips ("ADT")
12 could be assumed to cause a less-than-significant transportation impact. (Technical Advisory at
13 12.) The Technical Advisory derived this screening threshold from a CEQA categorical
14 exemption for "existing facilities, including additions to existing structures of up to 10,000
15 square feet, So long as the project is in an area where public infrastructure is available to allow
16 for maximum panned development and the projëct is not in an environmentally sensitive area."
17 (Technical Advisory at 12 & fn. 19.)

18 46. The Technical Advisory identified a range of potentially feasible mitigation
19 measures and alternatives that could be adopted to reduce significant VMT impacts from
20 development projects. (Technical Advisory at 26-28.)

21 47. Although local agencies could "elect to be governed by" its provisions at any time

22 after promulgation, CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3 took effect statewide on July 1, 2020,
23 and applies to all environmental documents set out for public review after that date. (CEQA
24 Guidelines §§ 15007(c), 15064.3(c).)
25 II. The County's Review and Approval of the SB 743 Implementation Project
26 48. On May 7, 2020, the County issued a "Notice of Intent to Adopt Updated
27 Transportation Study Guide," along with a draft version of proposed "Transportation Study
28 Guidelines." According to the Notice of Intent, the draft "Guide" included "options for the
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Board of Supervisors to consider related to: 1) the geography to use in calculating total/average
2 VMT for the unincorporated county; 2) criteria to use in determining which projects must
3 conduct detailed VMT analysis; and, 3) the VMT threshold to use in determining significance."

4 The Notice of Intent stated that public comments on the Transportation Study Guidelines would

5 be accepted through June 8, 2020.

6 A. The Planning Commission's Consideration of the Project

7 49, On May 15, 2020, the San Diego County Planning Commission considered the
8 proposed Transportation Study Guidelines. According to the Planning Commission's agenda,
9 planning staff requested that the Planning Commission "make recommendations to the Board of
10 Supervisors on a range of options."

11 50. County staff prepared a "Hearing Report" in connection with the May 15, 2020
12 agenda item. A copy of the proposed Draft Transportation Study Guidelines was attached as an
13 exhibit to the Hearing Report.
14 51. The Hearing Report explained that staff proposed "transitioning from [level of
15 service analysis] to VMT as a methodology for CEQA analysis." (Hearing Report at 2.)
16 52. The Hearing Report identified "three policy decisions that require Board
17 direction to implement SB 743 and establish VMT as the methodology for CEQA transportation
18 analysis": (1) establishment of a "gcographic boundary" to serve as the "average baseline VMT"
19 for comparison to estimated VMT from particular projects; (2) establishment of "project
20 analysis screening criteria for which projects must conduct a VMT analysis"; and (3)
21 establishment of a "Level of Significant Impact (Significance Threshold), which is the amount
22 of VMT created by a project that will be considered to have a transportation impact." (Hearing
23 Report at 9.)

24 53. In connection with the first policy decision-establishment of a "geographic
25 boundary'-the Hearing Report asserted that "[t]he State does not provide a recommended
26 geography to use, and jurisdictions, like the County, have discretion in defining the geography
27 to use in calculating average baseline VMT." (Hearing Report at 11.)
28 54. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines attached to the Hearing Report, in
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 contrast, acknowledged that the Technical Advisory discussed using the "region" as an
2 "appropriate geography to establish average VMT and thresholds." (Draft Transportation Study
3 Guidelines, Appendix F at F-2.) The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines further
4 acknowledged that the term "region," as used in the Technical Advisory, "refer[s] to a
5 [metropolitan planning organization] region as a basis for determining average VMT."

6 55. The Hearing Report identified three different options for "geographic boundaries"
7 to be used as possible "baselines" for VMT analysis: "the San Diego region as a whole," the
8 unincorporated area of the County, and "smaller subareas within the unincorporated area."
9 (Hearing Report at 11.) The Hearing Report designated these options as Option A, Option B,
10 and Option C, respectively. (See Hearing Report at 12-14.) The Hearing Report proposed that
11 these geographic baseline averages be used to define "VMT-efficient" areas of the County,
12 within which VMT would be expected to be 15% or more below the baseline average. (See
13 Hearing Report at 10.)
14 56. The Hearing Report stated that average VMT in the San Diego region is 21.85
15 miles per capita, while average VMT in the unincorporated area is 32.54 miles per capita.
16 (Hearing Report at 12.) Average VMT in the unincorporated area is higher because "trips
17 originating within the unincorporated area . tend to be fewer and longer in distance." (Id.)
18 57. The Hearing Report did not compare the three proposed options for "geographic
19 boundaries" based on their utility in determining total VMT, reflecting actual traffic patterns, or
20 elucidating the relative significance of transportation-related environmental impacts.
21 58. Instead, the Hearing Report compared the three options primarily in terms of how
22 much of the unincorporated County, and how many "potential dwelling units" contemplated in
23 the County's General Plan, would be exempt from VMT analysis and mitigation under each
24 option.

25 59.. The Hearing Report stated that Option A-using the San Diego region as the
26 relevant geographic boundary -would result in 61,881 acres (2.7%) of the unincorporated
27 County being designated "VMT efficient," and would exempt approximately 1,108 potential
28 dwelling units from VMT analysis. (Hearing Report at 12.) The Hearing Report further stated
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 that among other things, Option A would result in more VMT reductions, greater mitigation
2 requirements for development projects in the unincorporated area, more development projects
3 having to prepare environmental impact reports under CEQA, an increase in cost and time to

4 process land development permits, and a decrease in developments within the unincorporated

5 area. (Id.)

6 60. The Hearing Report stated that Option B-using the unincorporated County as the
7 relevant geographic boundary-would result in 81,215 acres (3.5%) of the unincorporated
8 County being designated "VMT efficient," and would exempt approximately 18,940 potential
9 dwelling units from VMT analysis. (Hearing Report at 12.) The Hearing Report further stated
10 that Option B would result in "less required VMT reductions," fewer development projects
11 having to prepare environmental impact reports, reduced costs and time to process land
12 development permits, and "less of a decrease" in developments within the unincorporated area.
13 (Id. at 13.) According to the Hearing Report, Option B would provide an advantage to
14 developments "along the western edge of the unincorporated area." (Id.)

15 61. The Hearing Report stated that Option C-using "subareas within the
16 unincorporated area" as the relevant geographic boundaries-would result in 85,550 acres
17 (3.7%) of the unincorporated County being designated "VMT efficient," and would exempt
18 approximately 17,676 potential dwelling units from VMT analysis. (Hearing Report at 13.) The
19 Hearing Report further stated that the effects of Option C on development would be similar to
20 those of Option B, except that Option C would not "provide an advantage to villages along the
21 western edge of the unincorporated area where we have seen more development occurring."
22 (Id.)

23 62. The Hearing Report recommended Option B-using the unincorporated area of
24 the County as the "geographic boundary"-claiming that it "follows General Plan Goals and
25 Policies" and "reflects the pattern of General Plan compliant development observed since 2011.3
26 (Hearing Report at 13.)
27 63. According to the Hearing Report, the General Plan identifies the potential for
28 60,748 dwelling units to be built across four regional land use categories. (Hearing Report at
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 11.) Option B would exempt 18,940 of these potential units about 31.2% of the County
2 total- -from any requirement to analyze or mitigate transportation impacts under CEQA.

3 64. An appendix to the Draft Transportation Study Guide attached to the Hearing
4 Report contained maps showing the location of proposed VMT efficient areas under Options A,
5 B, and C. (Draft Transportation Study Guide, Appendix C.) These maps designate large areas of
6 the unincorporated County as having "insufficient data to determine average VMT." (Id.)
7 Neither the Hearing Report nor the Draft Transportation Study Guide explained whether or how
8 VMT would be analyzed or mitigated for projects in areas with "insufficient data to determine

9 average VMT."

10 65. In connection with the second policy decision-establishment of a "screening
11 threshold" for "small" projectsthe Hearing Report recommended that projects generating less
12 than 110 average daily trips ("ADT") be exempted from VMT analysis and mitigation
13 requirements. (Hearing Report at 14.) Using this threshold, the Hearing Report concluded that
14 all of the potential General Plan dwelling unit capacity in the rural and semi-rural land use
15 categories approximately 30,860 potential General Plan dwelling units, or roughly 50% of
16 the County total-would be "exempt from SB 743." (Id. at 10.)
17 66. In connection with the third policy decision-establishment of a "threshold of
18 significance"-the Hearing Report proposed that projects with VMT at least 15% below the
19 existing regional VMT average be found to have less-than-significant transportation impacts.
20 (Hearing Report at 14-15.)

21 67. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines indicated that the same "regional"
22 average baseline used to designate "VMT efficient" areas of the County would be used in
23 applying the project-specific threshold of significance. (See Draft Transportation Study
24 Guidelines at 19.)

25 68. The Hearing Report and findings accompanying a draft Planning Commission
26 resolution proposed that the County find its approval of the Transportation Study Guidelines and
27 associated thresholds of significance exempt from CEQA.
28 69. The Hearing Report and findings stated four basic rationales for finding the project
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

exempt from CEQA: (1) the project is not a "project" under CEQA because it simply "codifies
2 existing law"; (2) the project is exempt from CEQA as a "ministerial" action because the County
3 must comply with SB 743; (3) the project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section

4 15308, which exempts public agency actions to enhance or protect the environment; and (4) the
project is subject to CEQA's "common sense" exception (see CEQA Guidelines section
6 15061(b)(3)) because it can be seen with a certainty that there is no possibility the project may
a 7 have a significant environmental impact. (Hearing Report at 18-19 & Attachment A, Ex. A.)

8 70. Individuals and organizations submitted comments to the Planning Commission

9 objecting to the Draft Transportation Study Guide and accompanying thresholds of significance.
10 Comments objected, among other things, to the proposed selection of the unincorporated County
11 as the "geographic boundary" for determining existing average VMT.

12 71. Notwithstanding these objections, the Planning Commission on May 15, 2020
13 voted 5-2 to recommend approval of the staff recommendations outlined in the Hearing Report.
14 72. Individuals and organizations continued to submit comments to Planning and
15 Development Services objecting to the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
16 significance.
17 73. CNFF submitted comments to Planning and Development Services dated June 8,
18 2020. Among other objections, CNFF's comments addressed the following:
19 a. The thresholds of significance recommended in the Hearing Report and
20 Draft Transportation Study Guidelines, which would use the unincorporated County as the
21 "geographic boundary" for calculating existing regional VMT, were unsupported by substantial
22 evidence.

23 b. The recommended "geographic boundary" lacked support because it was
24 not established to reflect actual travel patterns or indicate the significance of environmental
25 impacts. Rather, the "geographic boundary" was established in order to exempt future
26 developments from VMT analysis and mitigation requirements and to promote certain kinds of
27 development in certain locations.

28 C. The recommended "geographic boundary" conflicted with clear guidance in
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the Technical Advisory regarding the "region" to be used in calculating existing average VMT:

2 d. The recommended "threshold of significance" was unsupported because it
3 relied on the average VMT derived from the flawed "geographic boundary" as a baseline for
4 comparison.

5 e. The "screening threshold" recommended in the Hearing Report and Draft
6 Transportation Study Guidelines was unsupported by substantial evidence.
f. The "screening threshold" departed significantly from and was unsupported
8 by the rationale articulated for such threshold in the Technical Advisory.

9 g. By focusing solely on the number of daily trips, the "screening threshold"
10 failed to account for the length of trips originating in the unincorporated County, and thus failed

11 to serve as a rational proxy for VMT.

12 h. The "screening threshold" had the counterintuitive and counterfactual effect
13 of exempting all potential General Plan development in rural and semi-rural land use categories
14 from VMT analysis and mitigation requirements.
15 i. Each of the County's proposed rationales for finding adoption of the Draft
16 Transportation Study Guidelines and associated thresholds of significance exempt from CEQA
17 was contrary to law and without substantial evidentiary support.

18 j. Adoption of the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
19 significance had the potential to cause a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect effect on the
20 environment, and thus met the definition of a "project" in CEQA Guidelines section 15378.
21 Among other things, the recommended thresholds of significance would result in increased
22 I greenhouse gas emissions. The thresholds also were proposed explicitly because they would
23 encourage particular kinds of development and direct it to particular locations, which itself may
24 cause environmental impacts.

25 k. Adoption of the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
26 significance was not exempt from CEQA as a ministerial action.
27 1. Adoption of the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
28 significance was not exempt from CEQA as a proposal for legislation to be enacted by the State
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Legislature.

2 m. Adoption of the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
3 significance was not exempt from CEQA as an action to protect or enhance the environment. On
4 the contrary, the Project would reduce environmental protection by increasing greenhouse gas
5 emissions and exempting the vast majority of potential residential development under the
6 General Plan from analysis and mitigation requirements necessary to protect and enhance the

7 environment.

8 n. Adoption of the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of

9 significance was not exempt from CEQA under the "common sense" exception.

10 0. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance
11 conflicted with SB 743.

12 74. CERF also submitted comments to Planning and Development Services dated June
13 8, 2020. Among other things, CERF objected that using the unincorporated County to determine
14 average existing regional VMT not only would conflict with both the Technical Advisory and
15 SB 743, but also would cause increased greenhouse gas emissions and air quality impacts.
16 75. Sierra Club submitted comments to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors
17 dated June 8, 2020. Among other objections, Sierra Club's comments addressed the following:
18 a. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines improperly relied on the
19 County's Climate Action Plan in concluding that the overall "VMT trend" in the County "can be
20 considered downward." The Climate Action Plan had been ordered set aside by the Superior
21 Court for the County of San Diego, and further did not support the conclusion stated in the Draft
22 Transportation Study Guidelines.

23 b. Adoption of the unincorporated County as the "geographic boundary" for
24 analysis would be a discretionary project with the potential to have a significant effect on the
25 environment, and thus would require CEQA review. Specifically, exempting developments in
26 rural and semi-rural areas from VMT analysis using the proposed "screening" threshold would
27 increase both greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of conventional air pollutants such as
28 ozone, threatening compliance with both state and federal targets and standards.
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

C. The County's decisions to exempt future developments from VMT analysis

2 and mitigation, and its determinations regarding the potential environmental impacts of the Draft
Transportation Study Guidelines, were not supported by substantial evidence.

4 d. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines adopted a methodology that
5 impermissibly created a presumption that exempt projects would not result in air quality, noise,
6 safety, or other transportation-related impacts, in violation of SB 743. (Pub. Resources Code §
7 21099(b)(3).)

e. The thresholds in the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines are not linked
9 to meeting statewide goals for GHG reduction.

10 f. The Draft Transportation Study Guidelines proposed only vague,
11 conceptual, and inadequately supported measures for mitigating VMT impacts. Moreover, the
12 measures proposed in the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines would not address localized
13 impacts of VMT on air quality.

14 g. The screening process proposed in the Draft Transportation Study
15 Guidelines for determining whether future projects would be subject to VMT analysis would be
16 conducted entirely out of public view, in violation of CEQA's information disclosure and public
17 accountability requirements.

18 76. On June 12, 2020, the Fourth District Court of Appeal, Division One, issued an
19 opinion affirming the San Diego County Superior Court's judgment and writ of mandate
20 ordering that the County's February 2018 approval of its Climate Action Plan be set aside and
21 vacated. (Golden Door Properties, LLC v. County of San Diego (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 467.)

22 B. The Board of Supervisors' Consideration and Approval of the Project

23 77. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors held a hearing to consider the Draft
24 Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance on June 24, 2020.

25 78. County staff prepared a report to the Board of Supervisors ("Board Letter")
26 regarding the proposal.
27 79. The Board Letter acknowledged that in comparison to the County's incorporated
28 cities, "the number of vehicle trips in the unincorporated area are less in quantity, but longer in
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 distance. Lacking transit services and with a much less developed road network, many of the
2 residents within the unincorporated area drive to the cities for employment and services." (Board
3 Letter at 7.)

4 80. The Board Letter reiterated that the Board would need to make several "policy
5 decisions" to implement SB 743, including three "decision points": (1) defining a significance

6 threshold, i.e., the level at which transportation impacts from a proposed project would be
7 presumed significant; (2) defining a "geographic boundary to determine the average VMT"; and
8 (3) "*establishing project screening criteria for projects that do not have to conduct: VMT
9 analysis." (Board Letter at 10.)
10 81. The Board Letter presented two options for the first decision point (the
11 | "significance threshold"): 15% below the average VMT, or less than 15% below the average
12 VMT, based on the geographic boundary chosen in the second decision point. (Board Letter at
13 11.) Staff recommended the first option: 15% below average VMT. (Id. at 11-12.)

14 82. The Board Letter presented three options for the second decision point (the
15 | "geographic boundary" used to establish average VMT): the San Diego region; the
16 unincorporated County; and subregions within the unincorporated County. (Board Letter at 11.)
17 83. The Board Letter stated that using the San Diego region as the geographic
18 boundary would result in an average VMT of 21.85 miles. According to the Board Letter, this
19 option may likely result in "[t]he greatest amount of [greenhouse gas] reductions,' higher levels
20 of CEQA analysis, higher mitigation requirements for projects in the unincorporated area,
21 "[t]east benefit to infill development in the unincorporated area," and "[m]inimal incentive to
22 locate development" in the western portion of the unincorporated area. (Board Letter at 13.)

23 84. The Board Letter further stated that using the San Diego region as the geographic
24 boundary would provide "only 2,467 acres of VMT efficient areas" and would exempt
25 approximately 1,108 "potential General Plan dwelling units" from VMT analysis. (Board Letter
26 at 13.)

27 85. The Board Letter stated that using the unincorporated County as the geographic
28 boundary would "increase[] the VMT average for the unincorporated area to 32.54 miles."
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(Board Letter at 13.) According to the Board Letter, this option would likely result in "[n]ot as
2 much GHG reductions with not as many General Plan compliant projects subject to a higher
3 level of CEQA analysis" and mitigation requirements, the "greatest benefit to infill development

4 in the unincorporated area," and "the greatest incentive to locate" development in the western

5 portion of the unincorporated area. (Id. at 14.)

86. The Board Letter further stated that using the unincorporated County as the
7 geographic boundary would result in 45,444 acres of VMT efficient areas and would exempt
approximately 18,940 potential General Plan dwelling units from VMT analysis and mitigation.
9 (Board Letter at 13.)

10 87. An appendix to the Draft Transportation Study Guidelines attached to the Board
11 Letter further explained that using the unincorporated County as the geographic boundary would
12 support the County's "ability to establish thresholds that reflect agency specific goals and
13 policies." (Draft Transportation Study Guidelines, Appx. F at F-2.)
14 88. The Board Letter stated that using subareas within the unincorporated County as
15 the geographic boundary would result in average VMT ranging from 29.79 to 64.43 miles.
16 (Board Letter at 14.) The Board Letter found that this option would be similar to the option of
17| using the unincorporated County, except it that it would not create incentives to locate as much
18 development in the western portion of the unincorporated area. (Id. at 14-15.) The Board Letter
19 further found the subarea option would exempt approximately 17,676 potential General Plan
20 dwelling units from VMT analysis.

21 89. Staff again recommended using the unincorporated County as the geographic
22 boundary to determine average VMT. (Board Letter at 15.)
23 90. The Board Letter presented two options for the third decision point (the
24 "screening" threshold for small projects): exclude projects with less than 110 ADT, or exclude
25 projects with less than 200 ADT (based on SANDAG trip generation rates). (Board Letter at
26 11.)

27 91. Staff again recommended a "screening" threshold under which projects generating
28 fewer than 110 ADT would be exempt from VMT analysis and mitigation requirements. (Board
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Letter at 17-18.)

92. The Board Letter asserted that the County's adoption of the Transportation Study
3 Guidelines and thresholds of significance would be exempt from CEQA for four basic reasons:
(1) the Project is not a "project" as defined in CEQA because it has no potential to cause a
physical change in the environment; (2) the Project is exempt under CEQA Guidelines section
6 15378(b)(1), which excludes "proposals for legislation to be enacted by the State Legislature"
7 from CEQA's definition of a "project"; (3) the Project is ministerial; and (4) the project is
exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15308, which exempts actions to enhance or protect the
9  environment. (Board Letter at 20-21.) An exhibit to the draft resolution attached to the Board
10 Letter articulated the same basic rationales for finding the Project exempt from CEQA. (Board
11 Letter Attachment A, Ex. A.)

12 93. Numerous individuals and organizations filed comments with the Board of
13 Supervisors objecting to the proposed Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
14 significance.

15 94. CNFF filed comments with the Board of Supervisors dated June 22, 2020,
16 objecting to adoption of the Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance on
17 numerous grounds, including the following:

18 a. Substantial evidence did not support using the unincorporated County as
19 the geographic boundary for determining VMT.
20 b. The proposed thresholds of significance were not based on any
21 determination as to whether environmental impacts would be significant, but rather on an effort
22 to exempt as much development as possible from VMT analysis and to thereby create incentives
23 for development in certain locations. The proposed thresholds therefore were unsupported by
24 substantial evidence.

25 C. The proposed "screening" threshold for small projects was unsupported by
26 substantial evidence.

27 d. The proposed rationales for finding approval of the project exempt from
28 CEQA lacked both legal and evidentiary support.
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

95. CERF filed comments with the Board of Supervisors dated June 23, 2020,
2| objecting to adoption of the Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance on
3 numerous grounds, including the following:

4 a. The County's proposed approach would undermine the intent of SB 743

5 and the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.
b. The County's proposed approach would incentivize inefficient sprawl
7 development and result in significant environmental impacts, including increases in greenhouse

8 gas emissions and air pollution as well as greater VMT.

9 C. The proposed "screening" threshold did not accurately reflect the true VMT
10 impact of rural and semi-rural development.

11 d. The CEQA exemptions relied on in the Board Letter were inapplicable and
12 inconsistent.

13 96. At the June 24, 2020 Board of Supervisors meeting, Supervisor Fletcher
14 introduced a motion to use the San Diego region, including incorporated cities and the
15 unincorporated County, as the "geographic boundary" for establishing average VMT. The
16 motion failed for lack of a second.

17 97. On the motion of Supervisor Jacob, seconded by Supervisor Gaspar, the Board of
18 Supervisors instead voted 4-1 to:

19 a. Adopt Resolution No. 20-082, adopting the Transportation Study Guide
20 and thresholds of significance for vehicle miles traveled;
21 b. Use the unincorporated County as the "geographic boundary" for
22| establishing VMT;

23 C. Establish a significance threshold of 15% below average VMT; and

24 d. Adopt "screening" criteria that would exclude projects generating less than
25 110 daily vehicle trips from VMT analysis and mitigation; and

26 e. Find the proposed resolution complies with CEQA because: (1) it is not a
27 "project" as defined in CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and therefore is not subject to CEQA;
28 (2) it is considered "ministeria]" because the County is mandated to comply with SB 743; (3) it
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

is categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15308 as an action taken to enhance

2 and protect the environment; and (4) it is subject to the "common sense" exemption because it
3 implements existing law and therefore has no possibility of causing a significant impact on the
4 Ienvironment.

5 98. The County filed a notice of exemption regarding the project on July 9, 2020.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violations of CEQA - Against All Respondents

8 Lack of Substantial Evidence to Support Adopted Thresholds of Significance
9 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq; CEQA Guidelines;

10 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

11 99. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
12 in their entirety.

13 100. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of
14 long-term protection of the environment into their decisions. CEQA applies to any discretionary
15 action taken by an agency that may cause a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

16 101. Public agencies may not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible
17 mitigation measures or alternatives that would substantially lessen the significant environmental
18 effects of those projects. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.) Public agencies are thus required to
19 mitigate or avoid the significant environmental effects of projects they approve whenever it is
20 feasible to do so. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.1(b).)
21 a 102. "Determining whether a project may have a significant effect plays a critical role
22 in the CEQA process."(CEQA Guidelines 15064(a).) If there is substantial evidence in light
23 of the whole record that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead

24 agency must prepare an environmental impact report. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a)(1).) And if
25 the final environmental impact report identifies one or more significant effects, the agency must
26 make specific findings that feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that reduce or avoid
27 those effects have been incorporated into the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a)(2); see Pub.
28 Resources Code § 21081.)
23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

103. The determination of whether an impact is significant "calls for careful judgment"

2 on the part of the public agency, "based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data."
3 (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(b)(1).)

4 104. A "threshold of significance" is "an identifiable quantitative, qualitative, or
5 performance level of a particular environmental effect, non-compliance with which means the
6 effect will normally be determined to be significant by the agency and compliance with which
7 means the effect normally will be determined to be less than significant." (CEQA Guidelines §
8 15064.7(a).)

9 105. • Thresholds of significance may assist public agencies in determining whether an
10 environmental impact is significant. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(b)(2).) However, compliance
11 with a threshold of significance does not relieve an agency of responsibility for determining
12 whether substantial evidence indicates an impact may be significant notwithstanding compliance
13 with the threshold. (Id.; Protect the Historic Amador Waterways v. Amador Water Agency
14 (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1106-1107.)
15 106. An agency's determination as to whether an environmental impact is significant
16 must be based on substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f).)
17 107. Thresholds of significance serve the same purpose: to aid the agency in
•18 determining whether environmental impacts are significant. Accordingly, a threshold of a
19 significance adopted by a public agency for general use in that agency's environmental review
20 process also must be supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b).)
21 108. The thresholds of significance contained within the Transportation Study
22 Guidelines are not supported by substantial evidence.
23 109. Respondents' decision to use the unincorporated County as the "geographic
24 boundary" for calculating existing average baseline VMT was unsupported by substantial
25 evidence for several reasons:

26 a. The County's decision was not based on substantial evidence that using the
27 unincorporated County as the "geographic boundary" would result in a threshold of significance
28 that rationally distinguishes between significant and less-than-significant environmental
24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impacts.

2 b. The County's decision was not based on substantial evidence that using the
3 unincorporated County as the "geographic boundary" accurately reflected actual existing travel

4 patterns and VMT in the San Diego region.

5 C. The County's choice of a "*geographic boundary" instead reflects an attempt
6 to exempt certain types of development in certain locations from VMT analysis and mitigation,
7 and thereby to create incentives that would direct development to certain locations by reducing
8 perceived burdens of CEQA compliance. Such exemptions and perceived incentives are not the
9 type of substantial evidence that CEQA requires to support a threshold of significance or a
10 determination regarding the significance or non-significance of environmental impacts.
11 d. The County chose a "geographic boundary" that supported its ability to
12 reflect its own planning goals and policies, rather than a boundary that would aid the County in
13 distinguishing significant from less-than-significant environmental impacts. The County's
14 preconceived planning goals and policies are not the type of substantial evidence that CEQA
15 requires in order to support adoption of a threshold of significance or a determination of
16 significance.

17 e. The County's decision was unsupported by, and directly conflicted with,
18 recommendations in the Technical Advisory to use "regional" average VMT as the baseline for
19 analysis. The "region" referenced in the Technical Advisory was the "region" subject to
20 metropolitan planning organization jurisdiction-here, the San Diego region under SANDAG's
21 jurisdiction.

22 110. Because the County's selection of the unincorporated area as the "geographic
23 region" was unsupported by substantial evidence, the County's designation of "VMT efficient"
24 areas where VMT analysis will not be required also was unsupported by substantial evidence.
25 111. Because the County's selection of the unincorporated area as the "geographic
26 region" was unsupported by substantial evidence, the thresholds of significance of 15% below
27 average existing VMT adopted in the Transportation Study Guidelines were unsupported by
28 substantial evidence.
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 112. Respondents' decision to adopt a "screening" threshold exempting projects
2 generating less than 110 ADT was unsupported by substantial evidence for several reasons:

3 a. The "screening" threshold took into account only the number of daily trips,

4 not their length. Vehicle trips originating in rural and semi-rural areas of the County are longer
5 than vehicle trips originating elsewhere. Accordingly, there is no substantial evidence ADT
6 serves as an adequate proxy for VMT in the unincorporated County.

7 b. Available trip-generation data do not support the "screening" threshold.

8 C. The Technical Advisory does not provide substantial evidence to support

9 the County's application of the "screening" threshold to rural and semi-rural residential
10 development.
11 d. The County's attempt to exempt all residential development in rural and
12 semi-rural areas-where vehicle trips are likely to be the longest-from VMT analysis is
13 unsupported by substantial evidence.
14 113. The Transportation Study Guidelines impermissibly relied on the County's
15 Climate Action Plan in concluding that VMT trends in the County are on a downward trajectory.
16 The Climate Action Plan has been found invalid by both the San Diego County Superior Court
17 and the Court of Appeal, and has been ordered vacated and set aside. The Climate Action Plan
18 does not provide substantial evidence in support of the Project.

19 114. The County prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting thresholds of
20 significance that are unsupported by substantial evidence.

25 115. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
26 in their entirety.
27 116. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by finding and determining that
28 their adoption of the Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance was exempt
26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 from a CEQA. As a result, Respondents failed to disclose or evaluate the potentially significant
2 environmental effects of their actions, and further failed to consider mitigation measures and
3 alternatives that could lessen or avoid those impacts.

4 117. Each of Respondents' rationales for finding the Project exempt from CEQA is

5 both legally erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence.

6 118. Adoption of the Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance is
7 a "project" under CEQA because it has the potential to cause direct or reasonably foreseeable

8 indirect changes in the environment. (Pub. Resources Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines §
9 15378.) The Project is not subject to any of the exceptions to the definition of a "project"
10 provided in CEQA Guidelines section 15378(b), including the exception for proposed state
11 legislation.

12 119. The Project is not exempt from CEQA as a ministerial action.
13 120. The Project is not subject to the categorical exemption in CEQA Guidelines
14 section 15308 for agency actions taken to protect or enhance the environment.

15 121. The Project is not subject to CEQA's "common sense" exception (CEQA
16 Guidelines section 15061(b)(3)) because it cannot be seen with a certainty that there is no a
17 possibility the Project may have a significant environmental impact.
18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Violation of State Law - Declaratory Relief - Against All Respondents
20 Conflict with SB 743

21 (CCP § 1060)

22 122. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
23 in their entirety.

24 123. An actual and immediate controversy has arisen and now exists regarding the
25 legality of the County's action in adopting Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of
26 significance that could exempt the vast majority of potential General Plan dwelling units from
27 the VMT analysis and mitigation required by SB 743.

28 124. SB 743 mandates that "criteria" for determining the significance of transportation
27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts "promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the development of multimodal
2 transportation networks, and a diversity of land uses." (Pub. Resources Code § 21099(b)(1).)
125. The Technical Advisory states that local agencies should select thresholds of

4 significance for transportation impacts that align with all three of these goals.
126. The County's Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance not
6 only fail to align with the goals of SB 743, but also directly conflict with and undermine the
7 Legislature's purpose and intent in enacting SB 743.

8 127. The primary purpose and effect of the Transportation Study Guidelines and

0 thresholds of significance is to exempt development in large areas of the County from any
10 requirement to analyze transportation impacts under CEQA. Under the County's thresholds, the
11 vast majority of potential General Plan dwelling units (units in "VMT efficient" areas and
12 residential developments in rural and semi-rural land use categories) would not be required to
13 analyze or mitigate VMT.

14 128. The Board of Supervisors expressly rejected a motion to select the "geographic
15 boundary" for establishing average VMT that would have achieved the greatest greenhouse gas
16 reductions among the options considered. Instead, the County selected the geographic boundary
17 for establishing existing average VMT that would exempt the most potential development from
18 VMT analysis requirements, achieve the least greenhouse gas emissions, and require the least
19 analysis and mitigation of transportation impacts.
20 129. Achieving California's legislatively mandated climate goals will require
21 reductions in VMT. Yet there is no evidence that the Transportation Study Guidelines and
22 associated thresholds of significance will actually reduce VMT in the County.
23 130. The Transportation Study Guidelines impermissibly create a presumption that
24 future projects will not result in significant impacts related to air quality, noise, safety, or other
25 impacts associated with transportation, and thus violate the plain requirements of SB 743. (Pub.
26 Resources Code § 21099(b)(3).)
27 131. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that the
28  parties ascertain the correct interpretation of SB 743 in light of its contemporaneous
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 construction by the Office of Planning and Research, and further ascertain their rights and
2 obligations with respect to the selection of thresholds of significance necessary to comply with

3 and implement SB 743.

4 132. Therefore, Petitioners seek a declaration that the County's action in approving
5 Transportation Study Guidelines and thresholds of significance that will achieve the least
6 greenhouse gas reductions of the options considered and interfere with disclosure and mitigation

7 of other transportation impacts, while at the same time exempting the vast majority of potential

8 General Plan dwelling units from VMT analysis and mitigation, conflicts with the intent and

9 purpose of SB 743, is an abuse of discretion, or otherwise fails to comply with the law.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

12 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and
13 set aside all approvals related to the SB 743 Implementation Project, including adoption of
14 Resolution No. 20-082, the Transportation Study Guidelines, associated thresholds of
15 significance, and accompanying findings and determinations;
16 2. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with
17 the requirements of CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public Resources Code
18 section 21168.9;

19 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
20 injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and all others
21 acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action to implement the SB
22 743 Implementation Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the
23 CEQA Guidelines, and other applicable authority;

24 4. For a declaration that the SB 743 Implementation Project as adopted conflicts with
25 and impedes the purposes and intent of SB 743;
26 5. For costs of the suit;

27 6. For an order awarding Petitioners their attorneys' fees under Code of Civil
28 Procedure section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and
29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
