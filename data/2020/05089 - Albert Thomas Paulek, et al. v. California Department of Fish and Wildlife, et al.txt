PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2

3 1, In this action, Petitioner and Plaintiffs Albert Thomas Paulek (Paulek) and the

4 Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley (Friends) challenge the August 24, 2020
decision by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to approve the
5 San Jacinto Wildlife Area Land Management Plan (LMP) and certify the Program
6 Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) for the Project (SCH No. 2016061018).

7

8 2. The San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) was established in the early 1980's as

9 the primary mitigation site for the State Water Project's (SWP) direct impacts to

10 wildlife in southern California. In 1981/82 the California Wildlife Conservation

11 Board (WCB), implementing the "1979 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the

12 Mitigation of SWP Wildlife Losses in Southern California, made the first land
acquisitions of 3,318 acres establishing the new state wildlife area. Subsequently, the
13 WCB continued the acquisition programs by expanding the SJWA into two wildlife
14 management units comprised of the 10,000-acre Davis Road Unit and the more
15 easterly 9100-acre Potrero Unit,

16

17 3. The provision of a reliable and abundant water supply for the newly

18 established SJWA was an essential component for realization of the SWP mitigation

19 objectives at the Davis Road Unit. In 1987 the Department of Fish and Game
[renamed the Department of Fish and Wildlife in 2007] entered into a contract with
20 Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) to deliver reclaimed water to agriculture
21 users and the newly developing San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA). The WCB
22 provided $1.1 million dollars to fund 1/3 of the reclaimed water delivery pipeline

23 construction. In return for the $1.1 million dollars, the SJWA receives a reclaimed

24 water allocation of 4500-acre feet each year and EMWD reserved for the state a 20-

25 acre foot per day [6.5 mgd] capacity right in the pipeline.

26
44 The initial term of the reclaimed water contract was for 25 years. The contract
27 recognized the pipeline's long-term benefits would accrue for both wildlife and the
28 public and provides the contract is extended for the life of the pipeline with a pipeline

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

1 replacement provision to ensure the reclaimed water allocation would always remain

2 available for the SJWA. The initial 25-year contract term expired in June of 2014.

3 EMWD then sought to curtail the 4500-acre foot annual allocation of water and to
revoke the state's 20-acre foot per day reserved capacity right in the pipeline. After 4 public protest, EMWD agreed to extend the water contract for one year, pending the
5 development of the SJWA Land Management Plan. The reclaimed water contract has
6 been subject to annual extensions for the last 6 years with the California Department
7 of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) apparently consenting to the contract diminution

8 hoping public protest would disappear.

9

10 5. In November, 2003 the WCB approved the 25-million-dollar acquisition of the

11 9117-acre Potrero Canyon property for inclusion within the SJWA. The property was
owned by Lockheed Martin Corporation which is currently implementing a Consent 12 Order remediation of perchlorate groundwater contamination as a result of rocket
13 testing activities. The perchlorate contamination is limited to a 565-acre area on the
14 property. Lockheed Martin represented that the treatment of the perchlorate ground
15 water would not prevent the development and use of the 565-acre site.

16

17 6. In order to avoid the State becoming liable for hazardous substances on the

18 property , Lockheed Martin transferred fee title to 8552 acres of the 9117-acre

19 property to the state and encumbered the remaining 565-acre contaminated site
with a conservation easement. The conservation easement includes the transfer to
20 the State of Lockheed Martin's development rights. Lockheed also granted to the
21 state an option to acquire the fee interest in the 565-acre contaminated site at the
22 conclusion of remediation, without the payment of additional consideration. The

23 public will own the 565-acre site in fee once the state exercises the option with a

24 token consideration.

25

26 7. Since the WCB acquisition 17 years ago the 9117-acre Potrero Unit has been
locked up allowing no public access or public use for no credible/justifiable reason. 27 The denial of public access and public use is contrary to law [Fish and Game Code §
28 1347 and 1351], as well as the WCB Mission, Vision and Values statements.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

1 8. In 1996, CDFW entered into a Management Authorization (MA) for the

2 implementation of the Stephens' Kangaroo Rat Habitat Conservation Plan (SKRHCP)

3 with Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency (RCHCA). The MA authorized
the RCHCA member agencies to "take" [ to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill...] the 4
endangered Stephens' Kangaroo Rat (SKR) throughout western Riverside County
5 pursuant to Fish and Game Code sections 2081 [CESA] or 2835 [NCCP Act]. The
6 SKR "take" was permitted by CDFW in exchange for the designation and
7 management of seven core area reserves. The SJWA, managed by CDFW, is among

8 the most prominent for conservation of SKR in perpetuity. The SKRHCP "take"

9 permit has a 30-year term.

10

11 9. In 2004, CDFW issued an additional Natural Community Conservation

12 Planning Act permit concurrent with the federal Multiple Species Habitat
Conservation Plan (MSHCP) issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The
13 MSHCP/NCCP permit allows the "take" of 146 species of plants and animals
14 throughout western Riverside County outside the designated Conservation.
15 Area/Reserves including the Davis Road and Potrero Units of the SJWA. The

16 MSHCP/NCCP "take" permit has a 75-year term.

17

18 10. Under state law the SKRHCP and the MSHCP "take" permits are authorized

19 pursuant to the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Act (NCCP Act) (Fish
and Game Code §§ 2800-2835). Section 2826 of the NCCP Act provides: "Nothing in 20 this chapter exempts a project proposed in a natural community planning area
21 from Division 13 (commencing with section 21000) [CEQA] or otherwise alters the
22 applicability of that division."

23

24 11. The subject Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) fails to follow the

25 substantive mandates of CEQA. The PEIR fails to correctly analyze Project impacts

26 and require adoption of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would

27 lessen or avoid mandatory significant impacts to Biological Resources and allow the
public to safely access and use the Potrero Unit of the SJWA. Petitioners accordingly
28 request that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Cal. Code of Civil Procedures §§

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

1085 and 1094.5 directing Respondent CDFW to vacate and set aside the August 24,
2020 approval of the SJWA Land Management Plan (LMP) and CEQA certification of
the Final Program Environmental Impact Report (SCH # 2016061018).

4
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5,
7 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5

8 of the Public Resources Code.

9

10 13. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because

11 Respondent and the SJWA Land Management Plan Project are located in Riverside
County.
12

13 THE PARTIES
14

15 14. Petitioner/Plaintiff ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK (Paulek) is a retired (28.5

16 years) Department of Fish and Wildlife Associate Wildlife Biologist and was the area

17 manager of the Department's San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) from 1991 to 2006.

18 Paulek is a Certified Wildlife Biologist [The Wildlife Society] having extensive

19 knowledge and experience working with the wildlife resources and conservation
programs of western Riverside County and the state of California. Paulek 20 participated in the CQA review of the SJWA Land Management Plan as an
21 individual and as the Conservation Chair for the Friends of the Northern San Jacinto
22 Valley. Petitioners seek to compel the CDFW to properly implement its CEQA duties
23 to avoid and mitigate Project impacts to the plant and animal resources of western

24 Riverside County and the state of California and to conserve existing and future

25 wildlife habitat values and public uses of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area.

26
15. Petitioner/Plaintiff the FRIENDS OF THE NORTHERN SAN JACINTO
27 VALLEY (Friends) is a California non-profit conservation group dedicated to
28 preserving and protecting the northern San Jacinto Valley, the San Jacinto Wildlife

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

Area and surrounding environmental resources. Friends members reside and

2 recreate in the San Jacinto valley area of Riverside County. The organization

3 sponsors regular nature walks and environmental restoration activities at the SJWA,
Mystic Lake and the northern San Jacinto Valley.

16. Petitioners presented written comments and objections during the CEQA
6 review and provided oral comments and written objections during public hearings on
the matter being challenged in this petition. Petitioners and their members would be

8 directly, adversely and irreparably affected if the Project proceeds. Petitioners would

9 continue to be prejudiced by the project and its components, as described herein,

10 until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition.

11
17. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE 12 (CDFW) is the state agency having jurisdiction by law over the natural resources of
13 California. The fish and wildlife resources of California are held in trust for the people
14 of the state by and through the Department (Fish and Game Code § 711.7). The
15 Mission of the Department of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish,

16 wildlife and plant resources and the habitats upon which they depend for their

17 ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. CDFW is responsible

18 for the management of the SJWA Davis Road and Potrero Units.

19
18. Does through 20, inclusive are persons presently unknown to petitioners, 20 which are subdivisions or officers of the State of California who are responsible for
21 the actions described herein or for carrying out functions of the State and who may be
22 affected by this litigation. Petitioners will amend this petition to specifically identify

23 each respondent as required and as the capacity and identity of each respondent

24 becomes known.

25

26 19. Petitioners are informed and believe and based thereon allege that Real Party

27 in Interest the WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD (WCB) is an entity within the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the Wildlife Conservation
28 Law of 1947 (Fish and Game Code §§ 1300 - 1375). As a result of studies, the WCB

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

1 shall determine what areas, lands or rights in lands or waters should be acquired by

2 the state in order to a effectuate a coordinated and balanced program resulting in the

3 maximum restoration of wildlife in the state and in the maximum recreational

4 advantages to the people of the state. Since the initial land acquisition in 1981-82, the
WCB has approved and funded substantially all the land acquisitions and facility
5 projects implemented at the SJWA to date.
6

7 20. Does 21-50, inclusive are persons presently unknown to petitioners and who

8 have a legal interest in the project being challenged herein or are real property

9 owners, developers or others with a legal or equitable interest in the real property at

10 issue herein. Petitioner will amend this petition to specifically identify each such

11 respondent as required and as capacity and identity of each such respondent becomes
known.
12

13 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
14

15 21. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in

16 paragraph 1 through 20 inclusive.

17

18 22, In May 2007, the WCB approved $221,000 dollars for the development of the

19 SJWA Land Management Plan (LMP). In August 2010 the WCB approved an
additional $260,000 for the development of the SJWA Land Management Plan. In
20 November 2016, the WCB augmented the SJWA Land Management Plan funding
21 once again with $323,000 dollars bringing the total funding for the Land
22 Management Plan (LMP) to $804,000 dollars as of September 2020.

23

24 23. On June 6, 2016 CDFW issued the Notice of Preparation (NOP) of a Draft EIR

25 for the SJWA LMP to responsible agencies and the public in order to solicit

26 comments concerning the scope and content of the Draft EIR. On June 15, 2016

27 CDFW conducted two public scoping meetings at the SJWA warehouse, one in the
morning and one in the evening. Agencies and particularly the public provided
28 extensive written comments to the NOP regarding project impacts and concerns

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

1 requiring analysis in the DEIR. CDFW merely chronicled the NOP comments [Final
PEIR - Appendix A] rather than address the public concerns and impacts in the
forthcoming EIR (CEQA Guideline § 15064).

4
24. The purpose of the CEQA Initial Study is to determine if the project may have
5 a significant effect on the environment (CEQA Guideline § 15063). The Initial Study
prepared by the CEQA Lead Agency is intended to determine whether an EIR or a

7 Negative Declaration must be prepared or to identify significant environmental

8 effects to be analyzed in the subsequent EIR [emphasis added] (CEQA Guideline §

9 15365).

10

11 25. CDFW failed to correctly perform a CEQA Initial Study for the SJWA Land
Management Project, merely including the CEQA Guidelines Checklist [Appendix G] 12 questions without CDFW responses as required by CEQA Guidelines § 15063(d)(3).
13 The CDFW Initial Study misfeasance/malfeasance then allowed CDFW to
14 disregard/ignore the critically important CEQA Guideline § 15065 - Mandatory
15 Findings of Significance.

16

17 26. CEQA Guideline 15065 - Mandatory Findings of Significance:

18 (a) A lead agency shall find that a project may have a significant effect on the

19 environment and thereby require an EIR to be prepared for the project where
there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that any of the
20 following conditions may occur: (emphasis added).
21

22 1) The project has the potential to: substantially degrade the quality of the
23 environment; substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife

24 species; cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining

25 levels; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community; substantially

26 reduce the number or restrict the range of and endangered, rare or
threatened species. 27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

1 No CDFW Initial Study Response: The CDFW should have stated:

2 The CDFW implementation of the SJWA LMP ( Reclaimed Water Storage
area, existing and proposed waterfowl/upland game hunting, proposed
agricultural leases, new dog training areas, Tri-colored Blackbird
4 management or lack thereof, lack of a multiple species water management
5 plan and invasive species control plan etc.) will or potentially will reduce the
number or restrict the range of numerous MSHCP/NCCP covered plants and

7 animals.

8

9 2) The project has the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals

10 to the disadvantage of long-term environmental goals.

11
No CDFW Initial Study Response: The CDFW should have stated:
12 Implementation of the subject SJWA LMP has the potential to achieve a
13 short-term CDFW environmental goal (SJWA LMP) to the disadvantage of
14 long-term conservation of endangered species (MSHCP/NCCP Covered

15 species)

16

17 3) The project has possible environmental effects that are individually

18 limited but cumulatively considerable. "Cumulatively considerable"

19 means that the incremental effects of an individual project are
significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,
20 the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future
21 projects.
22

23 No CDFW Initial Study Response: The CDFW should have stated:

24 The MSHCP/NCCP "take" as a result of past projects, current projects and

25 possible future projects occurring throughout western Riverside County may

26 result in the species-specific extirpation of MSHCP/NCCP covered plants and
animals. The "take" associated with the implementation of the SJWA LMP
27
may be "cumulatively considerable".
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

1 4) The environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse

2 effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly.

No CDFW Initial Study Response: The CDFW should have stated: tt Adverse effects on human beings will/may result from the proposed public
access and use of the Potrero Unit in light of the Lockheed Martin
6 Corporation Consent Ordered remediation of the former rocket/munitions

7 testing site.

8

9 27. CDFW failure to correctly consider Mandatory Significant Project Impacts

10 resulted in the corruption of the entire CEQA review of the SJWA Land Management

11 Plan going forward. It allowed CDFW to avoid/circumvent the correct CEQA analysis
of impacts, mitigation and alternatives for the "take" of MSHCP/NCCP Covered 12 Species. It allowed CDFW to avoid the analysis of the Cumulative effects of species-
13 specific impacts both on the SJWA [NCCP Conservation Area] and off the SJWA
14 [NCCP "take" Area]. It precluded the correct analysis of the adverse effects on

15 human beings of public access and use of the SJWA Potrero Unit in light of the

16 Lockheed Martin Corporation former use of the site as a rocket/munitions testing

17 facility. Ultimately it allowed CDFW to avoid making the required Findings for these

18 mandatory significant impacts under CEQA Guideline § 15091: "No public agency
shall approve or carryout a project for which an EIR has been certified which 19 identifies one or more significant environmental effects of the project unless the
20 public makes one or more written findings for each of those significant effects..."
21 These CEQA procedural errors of law are clearly prejudicial and require correction by
22 CDFW.

23

24 28. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies since the initiation of

25 the CDFW Land Management Plan Project in 2007 by submitting written and oral

26 comments, including oral and/or written comments regarding issues raised in this
Petition to the Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) public meeting of May 20, 2020
27 and August 26, 2020, to request compliance with CEQA and the completion of a full
28 and adequate environmental review of the SJWA LMP. All issues raised in this

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

1 petition were raised before Respondents by Petitioners, other members of the public,

2 or public agencies prior to the approval of the project.

29.
4 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior
service upon the California Department of Fish and Wildlife indicating its intent to
file this petition. Proof of Service of this notification with the notification, is attached
as Exhibit A.

8 30. Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-

9 captioned proceedings or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation

10 pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to Prepare

11 the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.

12
31. Petitioners have served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's Office
13 to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney
14 general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is attached as
15 Exhibit C.

16

17 32. Petitioners have filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied with

18 Pub. Res. Code 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D.

19
33. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Pub. Res. Code section 21167
20 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112.
21

22 34. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law

23 in the following ways:

24

25

26

27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 VIOLATION OF CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

3 The California Department of Fish and Wildlife Did Not Comply with CEQA.

4
35. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
5 above.

6

7 36. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature

8 declared it is the policy of the state to: "prevent the elimination of fish and wildlife

9 species due to man's activities, insure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop

10 below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generations representatives

11 of all plant and animal communities... (Public Resources Code § 21001(c)). "Public

12 agencies should not approve projects if there are feasible alternatives or
feasible mitigation measures, which would substantially lessen significant
13 environmental effects of such projects, and that the procedures required by this
14 division are intended to assist public agencies in systematically identifying both
15 significant effects of the proposed project and feasible alternatives or

16 feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such

17 significant effects.' '[emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002.1(a)). "The

18 purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to identify the Significant

19 effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate
the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."
20 [emphasis added] (public Resources Code § 21002.1(a)).
21

22 37. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies
23 with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public

24 review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation.

25 An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision makers can

26 intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife certification of the Program 27 Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) for the SJWA Land Management Plan
28 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. "…the policy of the state that

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

1 noncompliance with the information disclosure provisions of this division [CEQA]

2 which precludes relevant information from being presented to the public

3 agency, or noncompliance with substantive requirements of this division, may
constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion..." [emphasis added] (Public Resources
4
Code § 21005(a)).
5

6 38. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is

7 inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Respondents:

8

9 a. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the project impacts on Biological

10 Resources, Public Safety [Potrero Unit], the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, the

11 MSHCP and SKRHCP "take" of endangered and sensitive species.

12 b. Failed to provide a stable, consistent and adequate description of the project,
13 which prohibited an accurate depiction of the project's impacts on the
14 environment.

15

16 C. Failed to provide an adequate description of existing environmental settings of

17 the project, vicinity, and regional context.

18

19 d. Failed to adopt a consistent and appropriate environmental "baseline" for
analysis of the project's environmental impacts that contributed to the EIR's
20 faulty analysis of environmental impacts.
21

22 e. Failed to adequately identify and analyze the project's biological resource

23 impacts - including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the SJWA, the

24 MSHCP, and the SKRHCP and wildlife resources in general.

25
f.
26 Failed to adequately identify and analyze and adopt all feasible mitigation
measures and/or alternatives that would minimize direct, indirect and
27 cumulative impacts on biological resources and the adverse effects of public
28 use of SJWA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

g. Improperly relied upon regional plans [MSHCP and SKRHCP] to avoid full

2 disclosure and mitigation of project's impacts. MSHCP/NCCP compliance

3 does not constitute CEQA compliance.

4 h. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures in
5 contravention of CEQA requirements that mitigation measures be clearly
6 defined and enforceable.

7

8 i. Failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or

9 avoid significant impacts in direct contravention of CEQA substantive

10 mandate that all feasible mitigation measures be adopted to avoid or reduce a

11 project's significant and potentially significant impacts.

12 j. Failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by improperly dismissing
13 feasible alternatives, including those recommended by the public and
14 responsible agencies, and relying upon an improperly narrow list of project
15 objectives to justify the elimination of feasible alternatives.

16

17 k. Failed to properly disclose, analyze or mitigate conflicts with existing local,

18 state and federal laws.

19
1. Failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by the public and
20 governmental agencies during review of the EIR.
21

22 m. Failed to recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR, despite the availability

23 of significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code

24 section 21092.1 and CEQA Guideline § 15088.5

25

26 n. Failed to adopt an adequate Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program in
order to assure that the mitigation measures and program revisions identified 27 in the EIR are implemented.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 14

0. Failed to adopt adequate findings that alternatives to the project and proposed

2 mitigation measures and alternatives that would have avoided or lessened the

3 significant impacts of the project were infeasible and failed to disclose the
readily available mitigation measures and alternatives that would meet the
basic project objectives.

6 39. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

7 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the

8 project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the EIR and

9 approval of the project must be set aside.

10
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
11
(Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in
12 Interest)
13 40. Petitioners hereby allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations
14 contained in the foregoing paragraphs.

15

16 41. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,

17 Respondents and Real Parties will implement the Project despite its lack of

18 compliance with CEQA. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm by Respondent's

19 failure to take the required steps to protect the environment and the implementation
of the Project. Injunctive Relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure 6 525 et
20 seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq.
21 and 1094.5 et seq. and under Public Resources Code § 21168.9 to prevent irreparable
22 harm to the environment.

23

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
