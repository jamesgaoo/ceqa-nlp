20 Pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7, Petitioner Comité Civico del Valle ("CCV")

21 hereby gives notice of its Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate filed September 11, 2020

22 (*Petition"), attached hereto as Exhibit A, which includes claims made under the California

23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

24 The Petition challenges the actions of the County of Imperial ("County") in approving an

25 expansion-essentially doubling in acreage and head--of an existing roughly 80-acre, 17,000-

26 head cattle feedlot ("Project") located 96 East Fawcett Road in Heber, California ("Site")-an

27 AB 617 community. Specifically, on August 11, 2020, the County approved the Project's request

28 Zone Change that eliminated the Site's "NO GROWTH ALLOWED" special condition adopted

JORDAN R. SISSON NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

1 by the County in 2007. The Petitioner alleges that the County relied upon a fundamentally flawed

2 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") lacking critical analysis involving air quality impacts,

3 odors, and greenhouse gas emission. So too, it appears that this is but the most recent incident of

4 inadequate analysis for cattle lot projects and alike by the County.

5 Petitioner urges the Attorney General to review the Petition.

2 Petitioner Comité Civico del Valle ("Petitioner" or "CCV") files this Verified Petition for
Writ of Mandate ("Petition") and alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1.

5 By this Petition, Petitioner challenges the approval by the Board of Supervisors of

6 Imperial County ("Respondent" or "County") of an approximate 17,000-head expansion

- IVI 7 ("Project") of an existing roughly 80-acre feedlot located at 96 East Fawcett Road Heber,

ipenai oupenui vuul nebepicu ui vuyu cuclvel! ouvmaugu v7-1I™cUCU ai UO.UC.VI 8 California 92249 ("Site") proposed by Real Party El Toro Exports LLC or ETX, LLC ("Real

9 Party" or "ETX"). Specifically, in furtherance of the Project, the County approved/adopted on

10 August 11, 2020: 1) a Zone Change (No. 18-0006) ("Zone Change"); 2) a Mitigated Negative

11 Declaration (State Clearinghouse No. 2020059027) ("MND"), inclusive of its Mitigation

12 Monitoring and Reporting Program (*MMRP"); and 3) various other approvals (e.g., Ordinance

13 1562, Resolution 2020-78, Resolution 2020-79) (collectively "Project Approvals").
2.

14 Petitioner alleges that the Project Approvals violated the California Environmental

15 Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq., ("CEQA"). Specifically, as set forth in the First

16 Cause of Action herein, Respondent used an MND in lieu of a more comprehensive

17 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), despite substantial evidenceincluding expert

18 comments-establishing a fair argument that the Project poses various significant environmental

19 impacts including but not limited to air quality and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, and

20 threatens public health and human safety. As set forth in the Second Cause of Action, Respondent

21 abused its discretion in approving the Project Approvals contrary to applicable land use plans and
zoning laws.

22 JURISDICTION

23 3.

24 This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 and Code

25 Civ. Proc §§ 1085 or 1094.5. The parties and the Project Site are located in Imperial County.

26 The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the Project Approval per Gov. Code

27 con 65009, and timely brought within 30 days of the August 13, 2020 posting of the CEQA Notice

28 of Determination for the Project per Pub. Res. Code § 21167. Petitioner served a Notice of Intent

LAW OFFICE OF to file this Petition on Respondent pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by mail prior to filing

JORDAN R. SISSON 2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

this Petition, as reflected in Exhibit A attached hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this action,

2 Petitioner has notified the Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of this Petition

3 in accordance with Pub. Res. Code 8 21167.7.

4 4. As alleged herein, the violations by Respondent have affected the beneficial

5 interests of Petitioner and/or its supporting members, as well as enforcement of important rights

6 affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a

IVI 7 substantial benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers affected

8 by the County's actions here, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by

9 requiring Respondent and Real Party to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements

10
AZAZ-U1-AA NanItIAnG KiNSnA ufnoun naidanw unc applicable to the proposed Project.

11 5. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this

12 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside the Project

13 Approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Party from taking further actions concerning the

14 Project until it has complied with those legal requirements. In the absence of such remedies,

15 Respondent's decision will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner

16 and the public. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress the likelihood of future

17 injury and interference with Petitioner's beneficial interests, its supporting members, and the

18 public's interest in having the law duly followed.

19 PARTIES

20 6.

21 Petitioner Comité Civico del Valle is a non-profit corporation located at 235 Main
Street, Brawley, California 92227, whose members include affected individuals who have a

22 beneficial interest in the matter set forth in this Petition. Petitioner's mission is to ensure

IDIOAUI Jupeny 23 environmentally responsible development and informed decisionmaking by public officials with

24 particular attention to environmental justice issues affecting stakeholders in Imperial County.

25 Petitioner's interest, and the public's interest, will be directly affected by the Project and

26

27 Respondent's failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA in connection with the Project,

28 including but not limited to air quality, odor, and GHG impacts resulting from the Project, as well

LAW OFFICE OF as adverse effects to the public health and welfare. In addition to having standing via is members,

JORDAN R. SISSON 3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner has public interest given the Project involves the County's duty to enforce applicable

2 laws. (See Rialto Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rialto (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 899,

3 914-916, n6.)

4 7. Petitioner objected to the Project Approvals before the close of the public hearing

5 on the Project. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies in that the determinations by

6 the Respondent are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by State or
E O.JE.UIrI 7 local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and

8 disputed with Respondent before the final approval of the Project. Respondent was given notice

9 and the opportunity to act in compliance with CEQA and other applicable laws but failed to do

: 10 so. It is well-established that any party who participates in the administrative process can assert 0207-11-e0 nonmunne CIOABAGA |RnaIn vour alLepiou IAuAdno muAd 11 all factual and legal issues raised by any commenting party, official, or agency. (See Citizens for

12 Open Government v. City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 875.)

13 8. Respondent County is a political and geographical subdivision of the State of

14 California with its principal offices located in the E1 Centro, California, with the legal ability to

15 be sued. (See Gov. Code § 23001 et. seq.). The County, via its subagents including its Board of

16 Supervisors, acted as the lead agency for environmental review of the Project and adopted the

17 Project's MND in that capacity, as indicated in the Project's CEQA Notice of Determination filed

18 August 13, 2020. The County has a mandatory duty a to comply with applicable local planning

19 documents, local ordinances, and state law requirements, including CEQA and 14 Cal. Code

20 Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines"), when considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory

21 actions, such as the Project.

22 9. Real Party ETX is believed to a be a California corporation and will be the ultimate

23 recipient of the Project Approval.

24 10. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

25 Real Parties named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who,

26 therefore, sues said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

27 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

2 11. THE SITE: The Project Site is approximately 160 acres located at 96 East Fawcett

3 Road at the southwest corner of the Pitzer Road/Fawcett Road intersection in the unincorporated

4 town of Heber (see figure below [outlined in red]). Currently, the northern half of the Site (appx.

5 80 acres) is used for an existing cattle feed operation (appx. 17,000 cattle) (see figure below [no

6 crosshatching marks]) with composting operations located along the southeastern corner of the

E 7 Site (appx. 40 acres) (see figure below [yellow crosshatching marks]). The Site is in close

8 proximity to numerous sensitive receptors, such as residents and students.

23 12. THE PROJECT: The Project entails an expansion of the cattle feedlot operations in

24 two phases, including phase one entailing 8,500 additional head of cattle along the southwestern

25 portion of the site (see figure above [green crosshatching marks]); and phase two entailing 8,500

26 additional head of cattle along southeastern corner of the Site (see figure above [yellow

27 crosshatching marks]), as well as relocating the composting operation to an unknown location

28 outside a 2-mile radius of the Project Site.

LAW OFFICE OF
JORDAN R, SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

13.

2 PRIOR APPROVAL OF EXISTING OPERATIONS: In July 2007, the Project Site

3 received a conditional zone change from A-2 Medium Agriculture to A-3 Heavy Agriculture,

4 allowing composting operations subject to conditions ("2007 Approval"). At that time, the

5 County determined that the composting facility--absent special conditions-could be

6 incompatible in some respects with surrounding uses. Among those special conditions include
"S17" that provided:

E 7 S17

vO.JL.UI 8 NO GROWTH ALLOWED:

9 This zone change does not in anyway allow the existing feedlot operation to expand from its current size. This will be based on the

8
IEpelaI OupelluI vuuiL nolopiou A307-11-C0 nanunanc ÁisAlOna nRnaun 10 current number of corrals, size of corrals and footprint of the operation, being 148 corrals.
14.

11 The 2007 Approval relied upon a Negative Declaration finding there would be no

12 new or additional air impacts. Petitioner is informed and believes that this determination was

13 made absent any air quality or GHG modeling, but rather based on the County's understanding

14 that the then-existing cattle feed operation had been in use for 25 years and would merely keep

15 the status quo. Over the objections of the public, including those made by Petitioner, the County
granted ETX the 2007 Approvals.

16 15.

17 APPROVAL OF PROJECT: In October 2018, Real Party submitted its application for

18 the Zone Change that would remove special condition S17. By February 2020, the MND was

19 prepared for the Project. In May 2020, the County's Environmental Evaluation Committee

20 reviewed and recommended approval of the MND. In June 2020, the County's Planning

21 Commission recommended approval of the Project Approvals. On August 11, 2020, the County's

22 Board of Supervisors ("BOS") approved the Project Approvals. On August 13, 2020, Respondent

23 filed CEQA Notice of Determination for the Project.

16.

24 Prior to the BOS's August 11, 2020 approval of the Project, Petitioner objected to

25 the Project, including written testimony through counsel that included expert comments that

26 identified fundamental flaws in the MND's air quality, odor, and GHG analysis. So too,

27 numerous other commenting parties raised significant issues about these and other environmental

28 and land use/zoning issues with the Project.

LAW OFFICE OF

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (WRIT OF MANDATE - CEQA VIOLATIONS)

3 17. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-16, as if fully set forth herein.

4 18. CEQA has a strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an EIR. This

5 reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an agency presumption is

6 must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a

1V1 7 project may have a significant effect on the environment. (See Laurel Heights Improvement
Ouvillueu 0g-11°zuou at VO.JG.VI vuun ALLapIeu unvuyu cucively IAAdnO IDHAAIU 8 Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; No Oil. Inc, V. City of Los

9 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.) A lead agency must prepare an EIR if a project may cause

10 significant effects on the environment, even if the project is beneficial. (See Pub. Res. Code §§

11 21100, 21151 and CEQA Guidelines § 15063(b)(1).)

12 19. The fair argument test is a "low threshold" where a project "may" have a

13 significant effect on the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a

14 significant impact. (No Oil, Inc, 13 Cal.3d at 83-84 n. 16.) Substantial evidence is enough

15 relevant information and a reasonable inference that a fair argument can be made to support a

16 conclusion, even though other conclusions. (See CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).) Substantial

17 evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinions

18 supported by facts. (See Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines §§

19 15064(f)(5), 15384.) Hence, an agency must prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued by

20 substantial evidence that a project may have a significant environmental impact-if there is

21 substantial evidence both for and against preparing an EIR, then the agency must prepare the EIR.

22 20. Here, multiple commenting agencies and/or parties informed Respondent that

23 substantial evidence showed the MND was flawed and failed to disclose, analyze, and adequately

24 mitigate potentially significant impacts on multiple resources. For example, as set forth in

25 Petitioner's comments including expert opinionsthe MND failed to analyze potential impacts

26 involving air quality, odors, GHG emissions or translate human health effects of these impacts.

27 Other impacts left unresolved by the MND's inadequate analysis include, but not limited to,

28 impacts on land use consistency, agriculture/forest resources, traffic, and cumulative impact (to

LAW OFFICE O 7
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 name a few). Nor did the MND or Respondent take into acount the unique environmental justice

3 community where the Projet Site lies, which will suffer acutely from Project impacts as compared

4 to other populations. So too, substantial evidence was presented that the Project improperly

5 removed special condition S17. (See e.g., Katzeff v. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2010)

6 181 Cal.App.4th 601, 614; Lincoln Place Tenants Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130

UO.UC.UI IAI J 7 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1508.) Additionally, substantial evidence was presented that the Project failed

8 to incorporate feasible mitigation measures that would substantially lessen or avoid Project

9 impacts that were not described in the MND, as required by CEQA. (See Pub. Res. Code §

8
IpOlas upaluI vuuil nubopiou nnuAno ÁIasuAnA uRnaun v7-11-CUCU 10 21081.6(b).) Also, Respondent was presented with substantial evidence there was a fair argument

11 contrary to the Respondent's CEQA findings, and requested more thorough EIR for the Project.

12 So too, no analysis was provided regarding the relocated composting activities, which amounts to

13 improper project piecemealing. (See e.g., CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a); Bozung v. LAFCO

14 (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284; McQueen v. Bd. of Supervisors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136,
1146-47.)

15 21.

16 Furthermore, Petitioner is informed and believes that this Project's inadequate

17 environmental review is but the latest instance in a pattern and practice by the Respondent of

18 inadequately reviewing the environmental impacts of cattle-feed projects and alike.

22.

19 In sum, Respondent failed to acknowledge that there was a fair argument of

20 potentially significant impacts despite being confronted with credible opinions and substantial

21 evidence on numerous issues. Respondent should have prepared an EIR. Anyone of the impacts

22 mentioned above would lead to the requirement that an EIR be prepared. The Respondent's

23 refusal to prepare an EIR was not based on substantial evidence and was a failure to proceed in

24 accordance with CEQA. Nor is Respondent's pattern and practice of inadequate environmental

25 review of these types of projects proper under CEQA.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 23. (WRIT OF MANDATE - INCONSISTENCY WITH APPLICABLE ZONING LAWS)

28 Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-22, as if fully set forth herein.

LAW OFFICE OF
JORDAN R. SISSON 8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 24. The California Supreme Court has described General Plans and zoning schemes in'

2 many ways. (See e.g., DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 [as a 'constitution,'

3 "for future development located at the top of "the hierarchy of local government law regulating

4 land use]; Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

5 517-518 [as a 'contracts,' where "each party foregoes rights to use its land as it wishes in return

6 for the assurance that the use of neighboring property will be similarly restricted, the rationale

7 being that such mutual restriction can enhance total community welfare"]; Orange Citizens for

8 Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 159 [as a 'yardstick,' where "one

9 should be able to 'take an individual parcel and check it against the plan and then know which

10 uses would be permissible"].) While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their
19-1I-ZUZU nannAnG fi2MAnA uRnaun naidanu uinn 11 zoning laws, "deference has limits" and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations

12 contrary to the plain language of regulations and statutes. (Id. at 146, 156-157 [rejecting attempts

13 to "downplay the facial inconsistency," the Court held the city abused its discretion finding

14 residential project consistent with general plan designation where "no reasonable person could

15 conclude that the Property could be developed without a general plan amendment"]; see also

16 Stolman, 114 Cal.App.4th at 928-930 [vacating variance based on the zoning administrator's

17 interpretation contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code].)

18 25. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that granting the Project Approvals,

19 including but not limited to removal of special condition S17 and approval of the Zone Change,

20 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondent failing to proceed in the manner

21 required by law and/or making the required land use findings (required under the Imperial County

22 Municipal Code ["Code"]) supported by substantial evidence. Without a Project-specific EIR,

23 oupenv mipena Code-required findings cannot be made given the numerous potential impacts affecting public

24 health and welfare, such as adverse impacts on air quality, odors, and GHG emissions (to name a

25 few). Here, the County's Code-required findings simply fail to "bridge the analystical gap

26 between the raw evidence and the ulitmate decision 3 (Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 515.) So too, it

27 would be contrary to applicable land use plans, such as the Site's underlying SPA Heber land use

28 designation under the General Plan and Heber Urban Area Plan. Also, Petitioner is informed and
9 LAW OFFICE C
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2

3 believes that various procedural errors were committed when Respondent approved the Project

4 (e.g., maintaining adequate documentation of the 2007 Approvals, missing information in public
hearing notices, etc.), which defeated adequate public participation here.

26.

5

6 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

FIVI 7 sought in this Petition. If Respondent persists in their refusal to rescind the Project Approval, and

UO.U4.UI 8 if Respondent and Real Party are not enjoined or stayed from undertaking acts in furtherance of

9 the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate

8
IOuAdno IDIAdI tuuil nucepiou ulluuyii CUGIIVGI nanIlinne J9-II-CUGU 10 remedy at law in that the Project can be occupied, operations commence and significant adverse
impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to the requirements of the law.

27.

11

12 For the foregoing reasons, the County has failed to proceed in accordance with

13 applicable land use plans and zoning laws and, therefore, Petitioner is entitled to the issuance of a
writ of mandate setting aside all Project Approvals.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief:

1.

16

17 That the Court enters a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondent to set

18 aside and void the Project Approvals, pending its full compliance with CEQA, including adequate

environmental review.

2.

19

20 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondent by CEQA to prepare

21 an adequate environmental review that addresses potential impacts to the environment in any
subsequent action taken regarding the Project.

3.

22

23 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondent by CEQA to
adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent action taken
regarding the Project.

24 4.

25

26 That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or an

27 injunction ordering the Respondent, Real Party, their agents and successors to refrain from

28 proceeding with the Project and issuing further permits while this Petition is pending. is
