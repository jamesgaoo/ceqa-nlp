11 INTRODUCTION

1.
12 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Allianco, formerly the SoCal

13 Environmental Justice Alliance, ("Petitioner") challenges the World Logistics Center ("Project"),

14 located in the County of Riverside. The proposed Project analyzed in the REIR calls for the

15 development of an approximately 40.6 million square foot warehouse building, most of it as

16 high-cube logistics space, on 2610 acres on the eastern end of Moreno Valley.
2.
17 City of Moreno Vallcy and City of Moreno Valley City Council ("Respondents")

18 certified the Revised Environmental Impact Report (*REIR") for the Project.

3.
19 In approving the Project, the Respondents violated provisions of CEQA requiring

20 that the REIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondents

21 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it

22 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondents failed to adopt all feasible mitigation

23 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain

24 and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondents was insufficient and

25 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences

26 of the Project, ::

4.
27 Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were

28 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations

F was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen
2 significant project impacts.

2

3 DOES through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are
unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to
4 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and
5 believes and on that basis, alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants
6

7 through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project that is the subject
of this procceding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through

12
13 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
14
22. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by
15 Respondents. In particular, Petitioner secks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the
16 Project on the grounds that Respondents has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and
17 other laws.
18
23. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources
19

20 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
21 24. Pctitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedics requirements to maintain this
22 procecding. By way of cxample and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition
23 to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.
24
25. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-
25

26 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
26.
27 Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA

28 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.
2 27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
3 law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
4
Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondents' approval of the Project also
5 rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those
6 laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in
7 approving projects under those laws, it remains under a clear, present, ministerial duty to
8 exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
9 Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within
10 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondents have failed and
11 refused to do so and have exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not
12 consistent with those laws.
13 28. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all its
14 legal duties as alleged in this pleading.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2
Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
3
(Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
4 29. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are fully incorporated into this paragraph,

5 30. Under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), this complaint on the REIR
6 for the World Logistics Center project ("the Project"), State Clearinghouse Number
20120210451 is on behalf of the Golden State Environmental Justice
8 Alliance (formerly the

9 SoCal Environmental Justice Alliance). The Project is to construct 40.6 million square feet of

10 warehouse space, most of it as high-cube logistics space, on 2610 acres of the eastern end of

11 Moreno Valley. Our complaint is in two parts, first addressing flaws of the REIR, and next

12 addressing the environmental justice impacts of this Project.

14
ANALYSIS OF REIR
15

16 § 4.3, Air Quality

17 31. The REIR's discussion of "Regional Air Quality Improvements" is irrelevant, given the
18 situation of the local area within the South Coast Air Basin whereby the area receives a

19 significant portion of the Basin's ozone pollution, The section contains these statements:

20 "The number of days exceeding the ozone national 8-hour standard has decreased between 1992
21 and 2011. During the 1992 time period, nearly all of the South Coast Air Basin had more than 50
22

23 exceedance days, with more than 100 days in nearly one-third of the Basin. This is equivalent to

24 more than three months during a year with ozone concentrations above the level of the standard.

25 Much of this area currently meets the national standard, including about two-thirds of Orange

26

27 After the City's loss to the Petitioners on five issues in the consolidated cases under Paulek v. City of Moreno Valley in 2018, the City originally circulated Revised Sections of the Final EIR, as if it had no obligation to recirculate a REIR, The City then determined that it had to revise and recirculate portions of that document relating to Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and 28 Energy. Apparently, the City now understands that its obligation was to recirculate a revised EIR, and we will accordingly refer to the document as an REIR.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1 County and one-third of Los Angeles County, where the majority of the Basin population lives
2 and works" (CARB, 2013).
3 32. REIR at 4.3-2. These statements are highly misleading and out of date; the relevant
4

5 situation for residents is that of the Riverside-Rubidoux air quality monitoring station, where

6 violations of the national ozone standard have been steadily increasing: as Table 4.3-3 tells us,

7 there were 84 days excecding that standard in 2017, as opposed to 47 in 2016, 39 in 2015 and 41

8 in 2014.

9 33. As the REIR also notes, the South Coast Air Basin is in Extreme Nonattainment for the
10 federal ozone standard, and in Nonattainment for the State standard regarding PM10 and PM2.5.
11
We note that Table 4.3-3 discloses the number of days there were violations for various criteria
12

13 pollutants, and to do the REIR's health studies later in the document the REIR's consultants must

14 have calculated the additional number of days of nonattainment in the Project vicinity that would
15 be attributable to the Project, but this was not disclosed in the REIR.

16 34. At 4.3-10 to -11, the REIR discusses RECLAIM as a source of additional PM2.5

17 reductions for the 2012 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). RECLAIM will not reduce
18 PM2.5 emissions attributable to the Project, and the South Coast Air Quality Management
19

20 District's ("SCAQMD's") Indirect Source Rule is unlikely 10 change this.

21 35, At 4.3-11, the REIR discusses 2012 AQMP mobile source implementation measures
22 including the Clean Vehicle Rebate Pilot Program for 1,000 vehicles statewide per year, and

23 funding assistancc of up to 1,000 light-heavy and medium-heavy duty trucks statewide per year

24 at up to $25,000 per vehicle. These limited programs are highly unlikely to significantly improve
25 air quality in the Project arca. At buildout, the Project is expected to have 18,202 truck trips per
26 day, of which the applicant assumes (incorrectly) that 379 will be natural-gas fueled. See
27

28 RSFEIR Appendix F (Revised TIA, July 2018) at 93, Table 23 (summing truck trips at full

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

buildout). And 10,831 of those truck trips will be attributable to heavy-heavy duty trucks which
2 would not be eligible for this very limited assistance. The REIR refers also to "Accelerated

retirement of older light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles through funding incentives"

without specifying how extensive those funding incentives are, and "Further emission reductions
5

6 from heavy-duty vehicles serving near-dock rail yards," which does not affect this Project.

7 36, None of the emission reduction measures at REIR 4.3-12 for off-road mobile sources

8 would relate to this Project.

9 37. The REIR also says that the 2012 AQMP relies on the 2012-2035 RTP/SCS from SCAG.
10 This Project is not consistent with that RTP/SCS because the Project required an amendment to
11 the General Plan, and regardless of whether the amendment occurred through the initiative
12

13 process, the Project is not consistent with the AQMP.

14 38. The REIR also refers to the 2016 AQMP, conceding that: "The most effective way to

15 reduce air quality impacts on the health of our nearly 17 million residents, including those in
16 disproportionately impacted and environmental justice communitics that are concentrated along

17 our transportation corridors and goods movement facilities, is to reduce emissions from mobile
18 sources, the principal contributor to our air quality challenges".
19

20 39. Despite this admission, the City and applicant make essentially no effort to mitigate the

21 impacts of vehicular, primarily diesel truck, pollution attributable to this Project,

22 40. Indirect Source Rule. The REIR indicates that SCAQMD's work on an "Indirect Source

23 Rulc" is consistent with "Control Measures MOB 03 from the 2016 AQMP." To spell this out,

24 since the REIR doesn't, 2016 AQMP MOB 03, "Emissions Reductions at Warehouse
25 Distribution Centers," provides that, "The SCAQMD is currently working with industry
26 stakeholders on conducting in-use truck trip studies and obtaining emissions information from
27
various warehouse distribution
28 types. This information along with emissions occurring in and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

1 around industrial warehouse distribution centers will serve as the basis for seeking opportunities

2 to reduce emissions beyond existing requirements ..  To the extent that these actions are
3 voluntary .. ., the emission reductions may be credited as surplus reductions (as defined by US
4
EPA) into the SIP. If emission reductions are to be included in the SIP, enforceable
5

6 commitments to ensure that the emissions are permanent [sic] will need to be made and may be

7 in the form of a regulation adopted by the SCAQMD within its legal authority or by other

8 enforceable mechanisms". 2016 AQMP at 4-28 to 4-29.

9 41, The REIR sets forth other information regarding the Indirect Source Rule that Petitioner
10 GSEJA did not previously have. Specifically, it indicates that the Indirect Source Rule will be
11 brought before the SCAQMD Board in the second quarter of 2020, and that voluntary measures
12
"could include"
13

14 a. A CEQA air quality mitigation fund projects could opt into to provide financial
15 incentives to fleet owners to buy cleaner trucks,
16 i. This should be mandatory, not voluntary, and the SCAQMD should take ~ the funds it received in its settlement over this Project for such funding so 18 that mitigation benefits those exposed to emissions from the Project. 19
b. Updated guidance for siting and operations,
20
i, Like CARB, the SCAQMD does not have land use authority and this 21

22 guidance would not be followed.

23 c. Development of necessary fueling/charging infrastructure by working with

24 utilities and regulatory agencies,
25 i. Charging infrastructure should naturally be located at the distribution
26 centers themselves, as this is where the trucks will be located, and this
27
should be the responsibility of project proponents, such as the applicant 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

-N0t0ON for the WLC here. Further, this requirement should be mandatory, not
voluntary,
d. Development of green delivery options whereby consumers pay a voluntary
surcharge when purchasing goods online.
i. Consumers are highly unlikely to pay a voluntary surcharge in any
appreciable numbers; if funding is to come from consumers, it would have

00 to be a mandatory measure.

9 42, The REIR then recognizes that mandatory regulations are being proposed, "since the
10 recommended voluntary measures would only result in limited emissions reductions;" this
11 approach "could providc several compliance options . . . including": 12

13 a. Requirements for a voluntary fleet certification program for both construction and

14 operational flects,

15 i. This measure would have to be mandatory if it was the compliance path

16 chosen.

17 b. Facility emissions caps requiring warehouses to directly control emissions,
18 i. The Air District would have to monitor emissions directly or monitor each
19
facility.
20

21 C, Mitigation fees for exceeding cap levels,

22 i. This would defeat any environmental justice benefit as the emissions

23 damage would be local and the distribution of fees likcly will not be.

24 d. Crediting options for installation of charging/fueling infrastructure for cleaner
25 trucks and TRUs and conversion of cargo handling equipment to zero emission
26 technologies.
27

28 i. This installation and conversion should be mandatory.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

- N m e. Requiring facilities to utilize zero emission trucks and provide infrastructure, or

i. We agree this should be mandatory.

f. A points-based system.
4
43. Relevant to this Project, there should bc requirements for 100% zero-emission cargo 5

6 handling equipment and at a minimum raceways for truck and TRU charging at each loading

7 dock.

8 44. The REIR states that, "This proposed rule would further reduce air quality emissions,

9 beyond those calculated in this analysis, as future operations of the WLC would be subject to this
10 rule once it is proposed and approved".
11 45. Several things are wrong with this. First, the REIR takes the opposite position later, that
12

13 the Indirect Source Rule would only apply to later construction (if at all). See Mitigation

14 Measure ("MM") 4.3.6.3E. Second, this is an REIR under CEQA, and CBQA requires analysis

15 and mitigation of significant impacts before a project is approved, and the City acknowledges
16 impacts are significant and it must adopt all feasible mitigation measures without waiting for this

17 Rule. Second, frankly, if SCAQMD has pursued this Rule only by interacting with "industry
18 stakeholders" rather than the affected communities, it is a captive agency and its Rulc is not
19 going to adequately mitigate for impacts as CEQA requires. 20

21 46, At 4.3-13 to -14, the REIR discusses "Diesel Regulations" such as the "Clean Truck

22 Program" for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the CARB Drayage Truck Regulation,

23 and the CARB statewide Truck and Bus Regulation, but the REIR does not address what
24 specifically these programs do, and it is it not clear to what degree regulations from the Ports of
25 Los Angeles and Long Beach will limit emissions at the WLC, as many trucks going to the WLC
26 will not be going to or coming from the Ports.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

F 47. At 4.3-14 the REIR says it is providing Toxic Air Contaminant ("TAC") measurements at

2 the Riverside Rubidoux station, but not for Diesel Particulate Matter ("DPM"), even though this
3 TAC poses the greatest risk. If the REIR wanted to do its job, it would provide background
4
cancer risks from SCAQMD's MATES IV, and providing OEHHA's environmental justice data 5

6 from CalEnviroscreen?. As the Attorney General's Office recently noted in opposing this Project
before the Fourth District Court of Appeal, residents of WLC's census tract experience ozone at 7

8 a rate higher than 98% of the rest of the State, and they experience cardiovascular disease at a

9 rate higher than 95% of the State. While the MATES IV data would be out of date, because it
10 does not reflect the effects of multiple cumulative projects such as the approximately 59 other
11 warchouse projects in the region documented in the REIR's cumulative impacts section, it would
12

13 at least provide a start for evaluating the true magnitude of the impacts of this Project. A review

14 of the MATES IV Estimated Risk Interactive Map available from SCAQMD's website reveals

15 that the background cancer risk in roughly May of 2015, based on studies that were done earlier,

16 was 501-800 additional cancers per million people. The trial court's ruling on the petitions for
17 writ of mandate, which provided that "The FEIR should include consideration of recently
18 constructed and proposed large warehouse projects in the summary-of-projections method, and
19
should analyze whether individually insignificant impacts may be cumulatively significant,"
20

21 intended that further analysis be done.

22 48. At 4.3-17, the REIR includes Table 4.3-4, which contains perhaps the first of the REIR's

23 repcated assertions that "the Health Effocts Institute Study clearly demonstrates that the
24 application of new emissions control technology to diesel engines has virtually eliminated the
25 health impacts of diesel exhaust," We disagree strongly with the REIR's assertions. The HEI or
26 ACES study had several design flaws which biased it in favor of finding no health impacts.
27

28 2 The REIR does include a reference to MATES IV at 4.3-18, but it does not include any of the above information, instead asserting only that "cancer risks are declining.' without quantifying background risk.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

1 Specifically, the study was done only on rats, not humans (unlike the over 30 studies that were

2 conducted aftor humans were exposed to diesel exhaust), the study did not use young rats which
3 would have been more susceptible to poor health outcomes, the study used a particularly hardy
4

5 strain of rats rather than the more susceptible strain usually used, the study failed to directly

6 measure how much DPM the rats were exposed to, and used mass as an indicator rather than

7 volume, and the study did not use nearly enough rats to reach proper conclusions regarding
8 health impacts to it the rats it did analyze. See Shrader-Frechette, Kristin, Ph.D., "State-Variable

9 and Representativeness Errors Conceal 'Clean Diesel' Harm: Methodologically Fallacious
10 ACES Research," in Journal of Environment and Health Sciences (Sept. 7, 2015). This is a peer-
11
reviewed analysis. As Dr. Shrader-Frechette notes, "ACES errs because most diesel-exhaust
12

13 deaths are from DPM, and confirmed scientific consensus is that there is no safe dose of any type

14 of PM .. . Consequently, even 10 percent of a large-volume, no-safe-dose pollutant, obviously

15 can be deadly".). In fact, as she says, "NTDE-2007 engines, that have low DPM (mass)
16 cmissions - appear to emit both much smaller particles and higher particle-number
17 concentrations than pre-2007 diesel engines. As a result, NTDE-2007 includes a higher a
18 percentage of more dangerous particles than typical diesel exhaust."
19

20 49. At 4.3-19 the REIR addresses the supposedly over-"Conservative Nature of Health Risk

21 Assessments," contending that they improperly model people's exposure outside when in fact

22 residents are inside 18-20 hours a day. DPM can and does go inside and Health Risk

23 Assessments are conservative because they are mcant to model risk.

24 50. Around 4.3-21 the REIR asserts that the Traffic Impact Assessment calculates vehicle
25 miles traveled ("VMT") with and without a "net effect," which is the assumption that
26 constructing the WLC will lead to reduced commute times. More than that, the revised TIA
27

28 projects reduced interim VMT because of this Project. Sec Revised 2018 TIA at 400 (Table

2 former Moreno Valley mayor, to the effect that VMT is highly likely to increase with this Project
both in the near and long term. Air quality impacts should be modeled based on this assumption
4
and not the "net effect" assumption the REIR made.
5

6 51. Under heading 4.3.3.3, "Localized Construction/Operation" the REIR indicates that the

7 REIR assumed cach truck would idle only once per day. It is more reasonable to assume that a

8 truck will idle both when it stops and when it starts again, SO this appears to be an

9 underestimation of emissions again.
10 52. At 4.3-29 the REIR assumes mitigation conditions whereby all construction equipment is
11 Tier 4. What kind of Tier 4, Tier 4 Interim or 4 Tier 4 Final? Regarding either, the REIR should
12

13 demonstrate that the Project will have access to sufficient equipment in the near term if the REIR

14 is assuming that the equipment will be used.

15 53. In section 4.3.3.5 the REIR provides additional information intended to comply with
16 Sierra Club v. County of Fresno. The REIR indicates there that EPA's air quality modeling
17 guidelines recommend using a PGM, which the REIR does not define in the text.
18 54. In section 4.3.6.1, "AQMP Consistency," the REIR states that operational cmissions
19
would be reduced in part through a requirement for 2010 trucks or later. There must be
20

21 enforcement mechanisms for this to be a credible limitation and we do not sce them, MM

22 4.3.6.3C is the provision of an "alternative fueling station? «for the motoring public," not for

23 trucks, but the REIR have apparently assumed in its air quality analysis there will be alternative-
24 fueled trucks; this is unjustified. MM 4.3.6.3E is weakly worded and allows refrigerated space on
25

26 3 The Revised TIA shows ( net reduction in VMT from passenger cars relative to the No Project Scenario in 2025, with Freeway
27 VMT going down by 56,734 and Total VMT going down by 39,160. This is not possible because Moreno Valley already has many logistics centers and their managers report that they must employ out-of-city residents with more skills, who make löng
28 cummutes to get to Moreno Valley. The TIA thus understates the amount of VMT and this undercuts the Air Quality Analysis. This complaint goes to the present air quality analysis, and GSEJA was not required to submit complaints on the TIA itself, or at
any other time, for GSEJA's complaint to be considered.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

the site if a demonstration is made that there are no environmental impacts. Based on the REIR's

2 entirely improper reliance on the HEI Study we can sec the REIR trying to make that proof.
3 Refrigerated uses have not been modeled in the REIR's mitigated scenario for either the air
4

5 quality analysis or the health risk assessment, and they must be prohibited.

6 55. At 4.3.6.2, "Regional Construction Emissions," mitigated emissions will exceed
7 SCAQMD thresholds for everything except PM2.5 and SO2. At 4.3.6.3, the Project exceeds all

8 sorts of LSTs even with the mitigations the REIR lists. At 4.3.6.4, "Long Term Operational

9 Emissions," with buildout in 2020 the Project exceeds all criterial pollutant emission thresholds
10 except for SOx. The City acknowledges that the applicant settled with SCAQMD for an "Air
11 Quality Improvement Fee," which we have no guarantec will go to mitigating air quality
12

13 conditions at or near the Project site. This is not something the Project can claim as mitigation.

14 56. At page 4.3-65, under "Cancer Risks," the HRA assumes the heavy-duty truck fleet will

15 be 89 percent diesel, 9 percent gasoline, 3 percent natural gas, and 0 percent electric. The Project
16 should not be anticipating any electric truck usage at the Project sitc without charging

17 capabilities at the loading docks, which the Mitigation Measures and Project Design Features do
18 not provide for. The sentence "According to the WLC Transportation Energy Technical Report
19

20 (ESA 2019), a High EV Penetration scenario projects that the heavy duty truck fleet could

21 consist of 30 percent clectric by 2035," is highly misleading and should be struck (although it's
22 already misled the REIR's local readership). It is misleading because in the REIR's Energy

23 Section, it concludes that the High EV Penetration scenario is spcculative. Even the projections
24 the REIR did make are speculative, because the REIR is overestimating the number of gasoline-
25 powered trucks likely to visit the site: The 2018 TIA calculates 18,202 truck trips per day at full
26 buildout. 3064 of these would be light-heavy-duty ("LHD") trucks, or 16.8%. To support the
27

28 REIR's assumption of 9% gasoline-powered, more than half of these would have to be gasoline-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

F powered. But according to the California Energy Commission ("CEC"), LHD trucks are in

2 weight classes 3, 4, and 5, and vehicle sales in this class are about 70 percent diesel and 30
3 percent gasoline. See CEC Final Consultant Report, Forecast of Medium- and Heavy-Duty
4

5 Vehicle Attributes to 2030 (CEC April 2018), at 5. Multiplying 30% (for gasoline trucks) by the

6 percentage of LHD trucks yields about 5%, not 9%, for gasoline-powered trucks.

7 57. At4.3-68, Table 4.3-27, "Estimated Cancer Risk for Residential Receptors without
8 Mitigation at Full Project Operation in 2035," shows a risk of 34 in a million inside the Project
9 boundaries, and 29.9 outside, except for 34 in a million along the SR 60. Inexplicably, the Table
10 claims there is no exceedance of the SCAQMD 10-in-a-million threshold along SR 60. At 4.3-
11 69, Regional Freeway Network Risk, the text at least acknowledges there is an exceedance.

3 emissions and "encourage alternative fueled . trucks on the project site." But a
4

5 feasible and entirely proper MM would be to require the inclusion of raceways with wiring for

6 truck charging extending to each loading dock SO electric trucks can charge. It is frankly absurd

7 to posit a High EV Penctration Scenario absent charging capabilities for trucks,

8 60. We find the REIR's assertions in the Construction and Operation HRA and the

9 Operational HRA, both with mitigation, not to be credible. We have located an expert on HRAs
10 to comment on this aspect of the REIR but she is not available to us before the REIR's deadline.
11 We reserve the right to submit her comments once the City has issued the RFEIR,
12

13 61, We're confused by the REIR's presentation of Tables 4.3-28, Construction and Operation

14 HRA with Mitigation, 4.3-29, Sensitive Receptors Starting at Full Operation in 2035 with
15 Mitigation, and 4.3-30, Sensitive Receptors Starting at Full Operation in 2035 with Mitigation
16 and Installation of MERV-13 Filters. For one thing, 12400 World Logistics Center Parkway is
17 not evaluated in the first two Tables, but is evaluated in the last, with the application of the
18 MERV-13 filter only, with a stated risk with the filter of 7.1 in a million4 The REIR has "cooked
19

20 the books" because a proper health risk assessment would model the impacts to the receptors at

21 that location outside of the house and unaffected by the filter (which the REIR does not know
22 they will accept).

23 62. At 4.3-76, Figure 4.3-6 shows an incremental project cancer risk with mitigation
24 disclosing that several receptors (two or three) along the SR 60 outside of the Project site will be
25 exposed to a risk of 10 in a million or greater. This risk is nowhere discussed in the text or in a
26 table.
27

28 4 The corresponding table in the Air Quality Report, Table 55b, footnotes "DieselNet.com, 2002." We're not sure what the reference is for, or if it is accurate,
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 22

63. At 4.3-77 the REIR reiterates the assertion that "The HEI Study clearly demonstrates that
2 the application of new emissions control technology to diesel engines have [sic] virtually
3 eliminated the health impacts of diesel exhaust." This conclusion is unwarranted and the REIR is
4

5 misleading for reiterating it. Among other things, the HEl Study did not test enough rats, did not

6 test the right rats, did not test the amount of DPM the rats were exposed to, and excluded young

7 rats that would be more susceptible to impacts.

8 64. At 4.3-78, the REIR states that the cancer risk reduction from ASHRAE filters is 50%.

9 This ignores that the filters do not trap the particles of the smallest sizes, which carry the greatest
10 health risks. Also on this page, the REIR says the maximum cancer risk would be approximately
11
3.0 in a million at Bear Valley Elementary School for either the construction and operation
12

13 scenario or the full operation scenario. This statement gives us pause because in the unmitigated

14 analyses there was mention of Ridgecrest Elementary School where the risk was greater than 10

15 is in a million. Why is Ridgecrest not mentioned here? Also, the risk at Bear Valley Elementary is
16 not appreciably reduced - only from about 3.54 to a 3.0 in a million, SO the risk at Ridgecrest may
17 well exceed ten in a million.

1 66. To mitigate all these significant impacts, the City must adopt all feasible mitigation
2 measures, which would include providing electrical hookups for truck charging at all loading
3 docks, and a significant increase in the number of solar panels planned, which we will discuss
4

5 further under the Energy section.

6 67. Section 4.3.6.6, "Summary of Health Risks," claims that the Project will have "minimal"

7 health effects relative to background numbers which the REIR provides for the entire Southern
8 California region. We're not sure why the REIR thinks that an increase in mortality of 14.17

9 incidents per ycar, attributable to PM2.5 only, is "minimal"; even assuming the REIR's
10 calculations are correct (which we doubt), an additional 14+ deaths per year is too many. Further,
11 between PM2.5 and ozone, there would be approximately 13 additional asthma related ER visits. 12

13 We're not sure why the REIR used EPA's BENMAP tool as opposed to OEHHA's

14 CalEnviroscreen 3, which would have disclosed that the census tract has a current burden in

15 terms of cardiovascular disease exceeding 95% of the rest of the State, without the Project.

16 68. The REIR does nothing to address the significant likelihood that increased incidences of
17 dementia will be attributable to the "NTDE," which is 50-90 percent metals.
18 69, At 4.3-82 the REIR cites to several studies that conclude there is no impact from
19
particulate matter on health. These studies are in the obvious minority and the REIR's citation to 20

21 them is an obvious attempt to mislead the public.

22

23

24 § 4.7, Greenhouse Gases

25 70. At 4.7-6 the REIR refers to federal regulations between U.S. EPA and U.S. DOT,
26 including a Phase 2 set of standards to cut carbon pollution by 2027. These standards are
27

28 probably not in effect,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 24

1 71. At 4.7-7 to -8 the REIR refers to the Pavley regulations. The Trump Administration has

2 revoked California's waiver and we cannot count on the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions the
3 REIR posits here. This is just another reason the REIR's splitting emissions into "capped" and
4

5 "uncapped," and only counting the "uncapped," is unwarranted. By any reasonable measure and

6 under Guideline 15064.4 (either version), the Project will have a significant impact.

7 72. The Sustainable Freight Action Plan, E,O, B-32-15, includes a ZEV target of 100,000

8 trucks on the road by 2030. What is the Project doing to contribute? Without infrastructure or the

9 capacity for infrastructure, those trucks will not come.
10 73. At 4.7-11 the RHIR describes the California Cap-and-Trade Program, saying "Fuel
11 suppliers are required to reduce GHG emissions by supplying low carbon fuels or purchasing
12

13 pollution permits, called 'allowances,' to cover the GHGs produced when the conventional

14 petroleum-based fuel they supply is combusted." While the Cap-and-Trade Program is mcant to
15 reduce emissions from vehicles in part (we believe it is also intended to address direct emissions
16 from extraction and refining), it is more than clear that the Program is but one step down a road

17 of many required to reduce emissions. As the Attorney General wrote in opposing the REIR's
18 "interpretation" of CEQA complianoc with AB and SB 32, "Cap-and-Trade is not a program
19
designed to reduce emissions from local government actions, or land use; instead, it was 20

21 designed on the assumption that local actors would simultaneously work to reduce emissions

22 within their spheres. Cap-and-Trade alone was designed to account for less than 40% of the total
23 emissions reductions needed to achieve California's 2030 climate goals, and on the explicit

24 assumption that local design choices would continue to reduce overall emissions (and hence

25 economy-wide costs in the Cap-and-Trade Program)". Attorney General Amicus Brief ("AG's
26 Amicus Brief') (filed Jan. 10, 2020) at 20.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 25

74. It's clear that the Legislature did not intend Cap-and-Trade to be the sole regulation of
2 California's combustion of transportation fuels, or it would not have adopted SB 375, which was
intended to reduce VMT within California's MPOs by changing residential land use patterns.

5 And CARB explicitly addressed the Sustainable Freight Action Plan as a separate strategy from
the Cap -and-Trade Program. See CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 1.

7 75. At 4.7-13, discussing the 2014 Scoping Plan Update, the REIR notes that: "Emissions of

8 criteria air pollutants, including ozone precursors (primarily oxides of nitrogen, or NOx) and

9 particulate matter, must be reduced by an estimated 90 percent by 2032 to comply with federal
10 air quality standards".
11

12 76. Obviously, this Project is a huge step in the wrong direction, Combined with other

13 warehouse projects in the area, it will undercut reaching this goal, as the trial court recognized in

14 requiring an improved cumulative impacts analysis which would include those projects (an
15 analysis the REIR did not provide, as we discuss under the relevant section).

16 77. The REIR falsely asserts regarding the 2017 Scoping Plan Update that "The cornerstone .
17 is an expansion of the Cap-and-Trade Program to meet the aggressive 2030 GHG emissions
18 goal and ensure achievement of the 2050 limit set forth by E.O. B30-15.3 The 2017 Scoping Plan
19

20 Update clarifies that Cap-and-Trade is not the "cornerstone," and the Legislature has only

21 authorized it through 2030, See AB 398 (2017), Section 4, amending Health & Safety Code §

22 38562. Continuing this discussion, the REIR tries to imply that the Cap-and-Trade Program's

23 limits arc cnough to singlehandedly reduce GHG impacts from trucks and cars, but this is
24 directly contrary to the language in the 2017 Update which the REIR quotes at 4.7-14:
25 "Beyond plan-level goals and actions, local governments can also support climate action when
26
considering discretionary approvals and entitlements of individual projects through CEQA.
27

28 Absent conformity with an adequate geographicaily-specific GHG reduction plan as described in

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 26

F the preceding section above, CARB recommends that projects incorporate design features and
2 GHG reduction measures, to the degree feasible, to minimize GHG emissions. Achieving no net
3 additional increase in GHG emissions resulting in no contribution to GHG impacts, is an
4
uppropriate overall objective for new development (CARB, 2017e)". REIR at 4.7-14 (emphasis

6 in original, underlining supplied).

7 78, Moreno Valley does not have an "adequate geographically-specific GHG reduction plan

8 as described in the preceding section" of the 2017 Scoping Plan Update, andthe REIR does not

9 demonstrate that this Project will achieve "no net additional increase in GHG emissions . . .
10 [from] new development."
11 79. This is apparent from the 2017 Scoping Plan Update's "preceding section," which the 12

13 REIR fails to quote, so we will do that here. Under "Climate Action through Local Planning and

14 Permitting," and "Recommended Local Plan-Level Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Goals,"

15 the 2017 Scoping Plan states: "Local government efforts to reduce emissions within their
16 jurisdiction are critical to achieving the State's long-term GHG goals, and can also provide
17 important co-benefits, such as improved air quality , [1] CARB recommends statewide targets
18 of no more than six metric tons CO2e per capita by 2030 and no more than two metric tons 19
CO2e per capita by 2050. The statewide per capita targets account for all emissions sectors in the 20

21 state, statewide population forecasts, and the statewidc reductions necessary [under SB 32 for

22 2030 and E.O. S-3-05 for 2050]. [1l Numerous local governments in California have already

23 adopted GHG emissions reductions goals for ycar 2020 consistent with AB 32. CARB adviscs

24 that local governments also develop community-wide GHG emissions reduction goals necessary
25 to reach the 2030 and 2050 climate goals [and that they be based on mass emissions, per capita
26 emissions, and service population emissions].. . . [1] Contributions from policies and programs, 27

28 such as renewable energy and energy efficiency, are helping to achieve the near-term 2020

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 27

p targets, but longer-term targets cannot be achieved without land use decisions that allow more

2 efficient use and management of land and infrastructure. Local governments have primary
authority [in this realm]. Land use decisions affect GHG emissions associated with
4
transportation, water use, wastewater treatment, waste generation and treatment, energy
consumption, and conversion of natural and working lands. Land use decisions play a
7particularly critical role in reducing GHG emissions associated with the transportation sector,

8 both at the project level, and in long-term plans . . . While the State can do more to accelerate

9 and incentivize these local decisions, local actions that reduce VMT are also necessary to mect
10 transportation sector-specific goals and achieve the 2030 target under SB 32. Through
11 devcloping the Scoping Plan, CARB staff is more convinced than ever that, in addition to 12

13 achieving GHG reductions from cleaner fuels and vehicles, California must also reduce VMT".

14 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 99-101 (emphasis supplied).

15 80. This Project does not reduce VMT from trucks, or cars (see Owings Declaration), in mid-
16 range or long-range timeframes. Further, the 2017 Update states there is a gap between the VMT
17 reductions to be delivered by SB 375 (which, by the way, have not materialized), and what is
18 needed to meet the 2030 and 2050 goals, and that besides planning that reduces VMT, local
19 governments must "increas[e] low carbon mobility choices." 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 101. 20

21 Here, "increasing low carbon mobility choices" means providing for electric truck infrastructure

22 at loading docks (as well as including enough solar power and batteries to supply those trucks
23 with power).

24 81. At 4.7-14, under "4.7.2.3 Regional Regulations," the City asserts that: "The RTP/SCS
25 exceeds its greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets set by the CARB by achieving an 8
26 percent reduction by 2020, an 18 percent reduction by 2035, and a 21 percent reduction by 2040 27

28 compared to the 2005 level on a per capita basis". (emphasis supplied).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 28

-

2 82. As we just noted, CARB has stated that SB 375 reductions in VMT are not enough, and:

3 an 18 percent reduction by 2035 from 2005 levels is obviously not the same as a 40 percent

4 reduction by 2030 from 1990 levels, and a 21 percent reduction by 2040 from 2005 levels is not

5 nearly enough to achieve an 80 percent reduction by 2050 from the transportation sector as

6 mandated by E.O.'s S-3-05 and B-16-2012.55.

7

8 83. The REIR notes that the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS bas an Appendix on Goods Movement, but

9 it fails to include the facts that the Appendix provides for "Full Deployment of All Commercially

10 Viable Truck and Rail Technologies" between 2020 and 2040, and "Deployment of Existing

11 Near-Zero Emissions Truck Technologies" and "Continue[d] Evaluation of Zero-Emission Truck

12 Technologies in Operational Service" with an enddate of 2025. See 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Goods

13 Movement Appendix at 49. As this Project will not complete Phase 1 until 2025, it should

14

15 support zero-emission trucks by providing electric charging infrastructure at loading docks.

16 84. At 4.7-15 the REIR commences its discussion of the City of Moreno Valley "Climate

17 Action Strategy," stating that it outlines how the City can reduce its organizational consumption

18 of energy and water and outlining "actions that the City can encourage and community members

19 can employ." The City of Morcno Valley's Climate Action Strategy, which has an end-date of

20 2020, does not even comply with CARB's requirements for a 2020 climate action plan, because

21 it never identified hard targets for reduction per capita or per service population. And it is

22 blatantly inadequate to limit emissions beyond 2020, which is the timeframe for the Project to
23 commence even very limited operations. Finally, whilc the REIR purports to demonstrate the

24

25

26

27 5 It is also too late to argue that the 2050 goals included in these Executive Orders are not mandated by science and applicable to this Project. See Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts ("SANDAG") (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 497, 515 (tinding that Executive Order S-3-05's "2050 goal of reducing Califomnia's grecnhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 lcvels expresses the pace and magnitude of reduction efforts that the scientifie community believes necessary to stabilize the climate," 28 and that it therefore had to be discussed in the SANDAG EIR: "This scientific information has important yalue to policymakers and citizens in considering the emnission impacts of a project like SANDAG's"),

NO 00 N 0 0 A a. Strategy R3-E1 is described as "Energy Efficient Development, and Renewable
Energy Deployment Facilitation and Streamlining: Updating of codes and zoning
requirements and guidelines to further implement green building practices. This
could include incentives for energy efficient projects.* While the REIR claims
this Strategy is "Not Applicable," the Strategy directly calls into question the

10 apparent policy of the Moreno Valley Utility ("MVU") to limit PV installations to

11 "one-half the minimum electricity demand a building experiences during daytime

12 hours." The City, which owns the MVU, should clearly waive this limitation,

13 which massively undercuts the Project's ability to achieve net-zero energy

14 (*NZE") and provide electric power for trucks (indeed, in the Energy section, the

15

16 REIR refuses to consider the High EV Penetration Scenario based on the

17 increased need for load for the buildings, and states that the MVU won't consider
it either).
18

19 b. Strategy R3-L2 is described as "Heat Island Plan. Develop measures that address

20 'heat islands.' Potential measures include using strategically placed shade trees,

21 using paving matcrials with a Solar Reflective Index of at least 29, an open grid

22 pavement system, or covered parking." The REIR asserts the Project is

23

24 "Consistent" because the Specific Plan calls for landscaping providing "50

25 percent coverage at maturity." The Specific Plan will not be fully operational until

26 2035, when the carth's climate is likely to be in significantly worse shape than it

27 is now, and the "shade canopy" is unlikely to grow in until about 2050 (at the

28 carliest). Therefore the Project should be "using paving materials with a Solar a

-

2 Reflective Index of at least 29, an open grid pavement system, or covered

3 parking," none of which are considered.

4 85. The City's description of the Climate Action Strategy in the REIR is also not at all

5 comprehensive. Besides the policies discussed in the REIR, the Climate Action Strategy includes

6 these goals:

7 a. "C41. Set goals consistent with State's Long Term Strategic Plan: All new

CO

9 commercial construction in California will be zero net energy by 2030." The

2=N 92 Project does not comply, only requiring the buildings to be approximately NZE
for office uses, not, for example, lighting for the buildings as a whole, or

powering clectric trucks.

b. "C 42. Encourage installation of solar and wind power systems and solar hot

14

15 water heaters," and "C 46. Adopt and implement a policy to increase the use of

16 renewable energy," are not complied with here because the MVU's policy of

17 limiting PV installation to "onc-half the minimum electricity demand a building

18 experiences during daytime hours" is not supportive of the stated renewable

19 energy goals (and is likely illegal, given the State's NZE goals for commercial

20 buildings by 2030, if not otherwise). See 2012 Moreno Valley Climate Action

21 Strategy at 286.

22 86. At 4.7-18 the City acknowledges that the Project would have GHG impacts if it
23 "Generate[s] [GHG] emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact

24

25 on the environment (i.e., exceeds the SCAQMD's 10,000 mt CO2e emissions screening

26 threshold of significance)." We're willing to accept SCAQMD's screening threshold of 10,000

27

28 6 The Moreno Valley Climate Action Strategy should be a part of the administrative record for this REIR because the City relies on it and cites to it in the REIR. The direct url for the Climate Action Strategy, which is clearly in the City's files as well as those of its consultants, is currently at http://www.moval.org/pd0/efficiency-climate112012nr.pdf/
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 31

b MTCO2e for its own projects as an appropriate measure, but the method the City engages in to

2 calculate emissions from the Project, which excludes the usc of transportation fucls and energy
3 sources and most construction emissions from analysis because they are supposedly "capped" by
4
the Cap-and-Trade Program, is entirely inappropriate, as discussed extensively above. In the 5

6 mitigated scenario, the supposedly "capped" emissions represent about 96% of Project emissions

7 and they count toward the Project's GHG impacts. As the AG's Office writes, "The CEQA

8 Guidelines allow projects to consider regulations "[with] which the project complies" for

9 purposes of considering significance of GHG emissions. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15064.4,
10 subd. (b)(3).) However, that consideration does not apply here and Respondents' approach,
11 which in effect relies on other entities to undertake Respondents' CEQA mitigation, not only
12

13 violates both CEQA's legal requirements and public disclosure and mitigation purposes, but also

14 undermines the state climate objectives Cap-and-Trade is intended to further". AG's Amicus

15 Brief at 15.

16 87. The REIR writes at 4.7-18 that: "Some policymakers and regulators suggest that a zero

17 emissions threshold would be appropriate when evaluating GHGs and their potential effect on
18 climate change. Such a rule appears inconsistent with the State's approach to mitigation of
19 climate change impacts. AB 32 and SB 32 do not prohibit all now GHG emissions; rather, they 20

21 require a reduction in statewide emissions to a given level",

22 88. The REIR's rejection of CARB's approach in the 2017 Scoping Plan Update (which it
23 declines to quote, contravening CEQA's requirements for a good faith cffort at full disclosure) is
24 fundamentally flawed. As is evident from the extensive quotation from the 2017 Scoping Plan
25 Update above, what CARB (the precminent agency on compliance with California's climate
26 action goals) said was first, that local agencies needed to develop individual and enforceable
27

28 climate action plans ("CAPs") containing measured maximum per capita limits of 6.0 MTCO2c

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 32

for 2030 and 2.0 MTCO2e for 2050, such that individual projects demonstrating compliance
2 with those CAPs would be permissible, and second, regarding those projects not covered by a
CAP, they should be net zero. In this regard, CARB clearly was indicating that CAPs represent
4

5 the caps on emissions from local land use, not that the Cap-and-Trade Program provided such

6 limits. The REIR's analysis is incomplete and incorrect.

7 89, At 4.7-19 the REIR relies on two unspecified negative declarations by SCAQMD where

8 it concluded that capped emissions do not count toward the 10,000 MTCO2e threshold. These

9 probably were refinery projects directly subject to the Cap-and-Trade caps. And the policy of an
10 agency without jurisdiction, the San Joaquin Valley APCD, is entirely irrelevant and inadequate
11 precedent, given CARB's clear authority and its contrary pronouncements on the subject. 12

13 90. The REIR relies on MM 4.7.6.1D to install solar panels generating 24,083 MWh per

14 year, which it concedes is only 5 percent of the Project's electricity demand at buildout. This is

15 far less than the generating capacity of the Project, which we estimate to be about 1.46 million
16 MWh per year, in fact it is only about 1.7% of what the Project site could achieve using rooftops
17 alone. Based on the Project's estimated power usage, if 27,083 MWh per year is 5%, then the
18 Project could power its full usage with 115 square feet of solar panels. To the extent this
19

20 development would require a waiver from the MVU, the Project must get one.

21 91. At 4.7-37 to -40, the REIR makes the wholly unjustified assumption that 21% of

22 passenger vehicles and 22.5 % of light trucks would be electric by 2035. The assumption

23 regarding light trucks is unjustified unless they have a place to charge, and the Project is not
24 giving them that.
25 92, The REIR claims that the Project follows the Sustainable Freight Action Plan, though the
26 Project would hinder achievement of its goals. At 4.7-43 to -44, the REIR asserts that the Project
27

28 follows the 2017 Scoping Plan Update. It is not, as discussed above. The REIR erroncously

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 33

F focuses solely on the Natural and Working Lands provisions of the Scoping Plan and not those
2 we quoted above.
3

4
§ 4.17, Energy 5

6 93. The REIR says the project will be designed to eliminate the need for natural gas in

7 building systems, positioning the WLC to become an all-electric development with potential to

8 operate on 100% renewable energy. As noted immediately above, the Project could do this now

9 with 115 square feet of solar panels, depending upon its demand. If the MVU tries to limit the
10 power the facility can glean from solar, it may be contrary to state law (particularly since the
11 MVU has not met the RPS standards, which are also increasing rapidly).
12

13 94. At 4.17-14, the REIR discloses that CNG/LNG fuel use assumed, per the traffic study,

14 that all visits to the alternative fueling station were from trucks. This is contrary to the wording

15 of the MM.

16 95. At 4.7-15, the conclusion reached is that solar power without battery storage is the best

17 renewable energy technology, generating at a level that solely supplies the office uses with
18 power. it Then it states additionally that "the project proponent is committed to requiring on-site
19 rooftop solar generating capacity up to the maximum level currently permitted by the MVU, 20

21 which is defined as one-half the minimum electric demand a building experiences during

22 daytime hours." MM 4.7.6.1D does include installing solar panels up to the limit permitted by

23 the MVU; MVU's limit is too low, however, as is cvidenced by its apparent unwillingness to
24 handle the High EV Penetration Scenario. That Scenario is likely a necessary component to this
25 Project meeting SB 32 requirements under CEQA,
26 96. Under "Technology Advancement," the REIR concedes that the California Public
27

28 Utilities Commission ("PUC") has goal for all commercial construction to be ZNE by 2030.

PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 34

+ Yet the REIR merely states that, "By proactively embracing an all-electric building design and
2 committing to solar-ready roof construction, WLC would be net-zero ready and in a stronger
3 position for compliance with future Title 24 updates." This seems to ignore that buildings
4

5 constructed after 2030 should have to comply with ZNE requirements.

6 97. Under both Scenario A, Low EV Penetration, and Scenario B, Medium EV Penetration,

7 the REIR states that DC power blocks "would charge thousands of vehicles per day," but no

8 mitigation measure requires the installation of DC power blocks, s0 this speculation is

9 unwarranted.

10 98. Regarding Scenario C, High EV Penetration, 20 percent of heavy duty trucks would be
11 EVs, and 10 percent of medium duty trucks would be EVs, by 2025, and 30 percent of heavy
12

13 duty trucks, and 20 percent of medium duty trucks, would be EVs by 2035. Despite relying on

14 these percentages (or higher percentages) elsewhere in the document, the REIR concludes that
15 the High EV Penetration Scenario is unwarranted.

16 99. The REIR agrees that one threshold of significance requires consideration of "The

17 project's projected transportation energy use requirements and its overall efficient use of
18 efficient transportation alternatives," citing CEQA Guidelines Appendix F, Section II C6. For
19 this Project, that means analyzing and providing alternative energy for electrified trucks. 20

21 100. At 4,17-22 regarding On-Site Renewable Energy, the REIR says, "The WLC Specific

22 Plan commits the WLC project to meeting the annual energy requirements of all office spaces
23 with PV, thereby effectively achieving net-zero energy (NZE) officc operations". (emphasis

24 supplied.)

25 101. NZE office operations are not sufficient; the buildings should be NZE for full operation
26 (including truck charging).
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 35

F 102. Regarding battery storage, the REIR says that "MVU currently has no policies or rales
2 that would allow WLC to use battery storage." It docs not necessarily have any policies or rulcs
3 prohibiting such use, and therefore battery storage should be permitted.
4
103. The closest the REIR comes to committing to charging for trucks is at 4,17-23 to -24 5

6 where it states: "Although it is speculative to state what the regional fleet mix will be as each

7 phase of the project is completed, and the adoption of ZEVs by WLC employees and customers

8 will be beyond the direct control of the WLC, all EV types should be anticipated in planning for

9 the onsite charging infrastructure. To that end, the project will construct the WLC parking arcas
10 with cable raceways for installing future EV charging stations, which will enable WLC to more
11 rcadily and cost effectively provide this service to future tenants if and when demand dictates".
12
104. We don't see that as an enforceable commitment in any mitigation measure. It should be, 13

14 and raceways should go to all the loading docks.

15 105. As an apparent excuse for not providing raceway to the loading docks, the REIR
16 consultants write: "many warehouses implement the "drop and drag" proccdure, where a truck
17 will bring goods to the facility, and the trailer (or sea-going container) will be disconnected and
18 left on-site for the lengthy process of unloading. An empty trailer may be connected and the
19
truck quickly departs to return to its point of origin. Conversely, an out-bound truck is usually 20

21 scheduled to retrieve a delivery load only once the container/trailer is full", REIR at 4.17-30.

22 106. Obviously, if trucks are electric, as they must be soon, scheduling will change
23 because by far the most convenient location for trucks to charge is at the loading docks.

24 107. Next, the REIR provides its ultimate excuse for not providing raceways: "Medium-duty
25 and heavy-duty zero emission trucks are in the very carly stages of commercially market
26 deployment [sic] and currently cost substantially more than conventionally fueled trucks, and
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 36

F current funding assistance programs do not fully offset that cost difference (ESA and
2 CALSTART, 2018)".
3 108. New technologies always cost more in their infancy, and then come down in price. This
4
is simply no excuse for not preparing WLC for the inevitable future. 5

6 109. Then the REIR argues that the High EV Penetration Scenario is "highly speculative"

7 relative to electric demand. False. Climate change is a major threat in California, and the region's

8 criteria air pollutant exceedances must be addressed. Transition to electric trucks is needed for

9 both reasons.

10 110. Regarding the REIR's projections for MVU's capacity, since the City's consultants and
11 MVU seem to believe MVU can't power the WLC under the High EV Penetration Scenario, the 12

13 MVU should not limit the solar capacity of the site in the way that it apparently is. This should

14 be obvious. As noted above, the buildings have the capacity to gencrate at least 1.46 million
15 MWh of solar power. Further, the projections the REIR makes for the buildings' minimum
16 daytime use should include the power nceded for the trucks under the High EV Penetration
17 Scenario. The WLC should provide solar panels to power the trucks in particular because the
18 REIR discloses that "the WLC project's estimated electrical consumption would account for
19 between 74 and 113 percent of MVU's projected electricity projected [sic] sales, depending on 20

21 the EV penetration scenario for Phase 1 (2025)." If the WLC alone constitutes 113% of projected
22 sales, the MVU will have to expand its portfolio massively, while keeping in line with the
23 Renewable Portfolio Standard (something it apparently is not doing currently). This impact must

24 be ranked as significant, because as the REIR acknowledges, the thresholds of significance
25 require that the City and Project proponent evaluate "The effects of the project on local and
26 regional energy supplies and on requirements for additional capacity ([CEQA Guidelines]
27

28 Appendix F Section II C-2)," as a factor, and the separate criterion that "A project would result

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 37

-

2 in significant impacts with regard to energy use and consumption if it would require the

3 construction of new clectrical . . . facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of

4 which would cause significant environmental effects." REIR at 4.17-18 to 4.17-19.

5 111. Standalone solar facilities in California's desert, perhaps the primary source of renewable

6 power which utilities have been relying upon, have significant environmental impacts on desert

7

8 wildlife, including but not limited to profound impacts on avian populations using the Pacific

9 Flyway, the desert tortoise, and the burrowing owl. The City must remember that the mortality

10 threshold for sensitive, threatened or endangered avian species is the "one bird" take threshold

11 set forth in the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

12 See 16 § U.S.C. $ 703, 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(B) and Cal. Fish & Game Code § 86. Under this

13 threshold under CEQA, the death of even one special-status bird, or a desert tortoise, is a

14 significant impact if no take permit has been obtained (and GSEJA is not aware of any take
15 permits being issued to any solar facilities in the desert). See Pub. Res. Code 21002.1(c).
16 USFWS documented the doaths of at least two federally-endangered Yuma Clapper Rails at solar
17

18 projects in the desert in May of 2013 and April of 2014, as its comments on one Project, the Palo

19 Verde Mesa Solar Project, indicate. In sum, the WLC project would cause significant impacts

20 because it will require the construction or expansion of new electrical facilities which would

21 have significant impacts themselves.

22

23 112. Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines requires that the City and Project sponsor calculate
"The effects of the project on1 peak and basc period demands for electricity . . . (Appendix F
24 Section II C-3)." REIR at 4.17-19. The REIR notes that based on MVU's forecasts, peak demand
25

26 for its power grid will be 83.4 MW in 2025. Under the High EV Penetration Scenario, 2025 peak

27 demand from the Project alone would be 54,4 MW. The REIR seeks to give readers a false sense

28 of security, stating that; "MVU's 2018 IRP anticipates growth in the region and specifically

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 38

1 considers the electrical demand generated by energy-intensive account [sic] focused in the
2 logistics industry. The IRP states that large energy intensive projects like the WLC project are
3 included in the projected growth". REIR at 4.17-30.
4
113. It is clear, however, from what the REIR
5 says that MVU has not projected for the WLC,

6 because the WLC alone would account for 113 percent of MVU's projected sales in 20257.

7 114. Another reason this Project would lead to the "wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary"
8 consumption of energy is that the MVU apparently does not presently comply with the state's

9 RPS. Specifically, the REIR acknowledges that MVU only had renewable power sources
10 accounting for 17% of its "overall energy mix" in 2017, REIR at 4.17- 31, but under SB 1078
11

12 (2002), MVU had to have 20% in its renewables portfolio by that year, Because SB 350 requires

13 33% renewables generation by the end of 2020, MVU must double its renewables generation

14 between 2017 and the beginning of 2021. Further, the MVU 2018 Integrated Resource Plan (July
15 2018) ('MVU IRP"), which we presume will be part of the administrative record since the REIR
16 cites it. is out of date because under SB 100 (Sept. 10, 2018), the following procurement
17 requirements apply, including to local publicly owned electric utilities:
18
a. 44% by 12/31/24
19
b. 50% by 12/31/26
20

21 c. 52% by 12/31/27

22 d. 60% by 12/31/30

23

24
7
25 See also the contradietory discussion at REIR 4.17-35: Although the project would result in moderate increases in anmual electrical demand from EV charging compared to MVU's current supply (for the low and medium EV penetration scenarios), MVU is committed to meeting the project's electricity demand through a future IRP update and planning process. As 26 mentioned above, MVU's IRP addresses the fact that the project would exceed the utility's current and forecasted demand. However, the IRP states that energy-intensive logistics projects are considered in the projected growth. Any determination on
27 additional capacity would be speculative considering MVU is aware of the project aud its offect on grid electricity. MVU has a cunsiderable amount of time to procure energy resources in anticipation of the project's development.
28 MVU's IRP does not address WLC's exceedance of its current and forecasted demand. MVU does not have a *considerable amount of time" to procure further energy, particularly considering RPS demands. And projection of additional capacity is not speculative, in fuct, Appendix requires it.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 39

115. Thus, MVU must nearly triple its renewables generation by the end of 2026. Despite

2 these requirements, MVU has indicated that it disfavors local renewable resource development
3 on customer sites because it claims that utility-scale projects in the desert are cheaper. See MVU
4

5 IRP at 4-11. However, (1) utility-scale projects are having significant impacts, and (2) MVU's

6 policy of limiting solar development on customer sites is unreasonable, given its own failure to

7 comply with the RPS.

8 116. The REIR states that, "at full buildout WLC will feature the equivalent of twenty-seven

9 60,000 square-foot net-zero office buildings. To put this in context, the entirc State of California
10 has about 190 net-zero commercial buildings that are currently verified or designed as of 2017
11 (CPUC, 2017)". REIR at 4.17-31,
12

13 117. This is highly misleading, as the WLC buildings will each be about 1,500,000 square

14 feet, and the buildings will not be NZE with respect even to demand for lighting or cooling,
15 much less with respect to their ability to power trucks or cars.

16 118. It appears MVU is complicit in the WLC's desire to endanger the hcalth of the residents

17 of Moreno Valley and the safety of the planet, because the REIR says, "Although the project
18 would result in moderate increases in annual electrical demand compared to MVU's current
19

20 supply, for the low and medium EV penetration scenarios, MVU is committed to meeting the

21 project's electricity demand through a future IRP update and planning process", REIR at 4.17-

22 31.

23 119. If MVU has no such commitment regarding the High EV Penctration Secnario, the City
24 (which owns MVU) is single-handedly imperiling its residents and the planet.
25 120. The Projcct proposes a CNG/LNG fucling station, which the REIR says in combination
26 with large trucks, yard trucks and forklifts will consume 821,523 MMBtu/year. The REIR
27

28 compares this to statewide natural gas consumption in 2018 for some reason. The Project's

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 40

commitment to a CNG/LNG fueling station and yard trucks and forklifts running on CNG/LNG

2 ropresents a cumulatively considerable impact regarding GHGs, and is wasteful. Instead, the
3 proposed station should provide additional DC fast-charging capability, and the REIR should
4

5 have mitigation measures (1) requiring DC fastcharging (rather than Level Two) charging at

6 sites, and (2) requiring electric forklifts and yard trucks.

7 121. The REIR's analysis is based on the assumptions of the Revised Traffic Study, which

8 anticipated 204 trucks completely refueling at the CNG/LNG station per day. However, the MM

9 anticipates no truck use of the station, and the station should provide electric charging.
10 122. Regarding fuel efficiency, the REIR states that the Project would benefit from
11 California's Pavley standards, which are "the most stringent in the nation and among the most
12

13 stringent in the world." The Pavley/ACC standards are not enforceable, given U.S.

14 EPA's denial of California's Clean Air Act waiver. This information should have been
15 included in the REIR, which came out in December 2019, long after California sued the EPA in

16 September.

17 123. At 4.17-37 to -38, the REIR purports to discuss whether the Project will require the
18 construction or expansion of new clectrical facilities which could have significant environmental
19
effects. We have addressed this question above. The REIR fails to discuss the need for additional
20

21 utility-scale generation within this section.

22 124. At 4.17-39 to -40, the REIR addresses the threshold of the degree to which the Project

23 complies with existing energy standards, but it does not discuss the pending Title 24 requirement

24 that all commercial buildings be ZNE by 2030. See CPUC, California Energy Efficiency
25 Strategic Plan Update, 2011 at 30-33. Failure to comply with this requirement means the Project
26 "would conflict with or obstruct a state . plan for renewable energy or energy efficiency. REIR

at 4,17-19.

3 § 6.3, Cumulative Air Quality Impacts

4 125. Consistently throughout this analysis the REIR refers to 67 projects out of 359 that have

5 been completed or begun construction and concludes that therefore there are 289 potentially

6 cumulative projects. These numbers do not add up.

7

8 126. There is no real analysis of cumulative impacts in this section except regarding the HRA;

9 the REIR merely concludes that curnulative impacts will be significant based on Project impacts

10 being significant. The REIR also proposes no further mitigations for cumulative impacts, which

11 it must, because they were found to be significant.

12 127. Regarding the cumulative HRA, the REIR does not provide a significant amount of data,

13 however, it appears from the discussion at 6.3-32 that the consultants modeled dispersion of

14

15 DPM over a 3,500 square mile area even though the cumulative projects cover an arca that

appears

16 to be considerably smaller than 1024 square miles (see Figure 6.3-1). Nevertheless, the

HRA comes

17 out with significant cumulative impacts in terms of incremental cancer risk and

18 cancer burden. REIR at 6.3-48 to -49. We suspect this analysis significantly underestimates

19 cumulative impacts in terms of health risk, but again, the REIR proposes no
measures, although it is required to. additional mitigation

6 § 6.17, Cumulative Energy Impacts

7 129. The REIR does not consider the proper cumulative energy impacts of warchouse projects

8 relative to the solar they can produce, anymore than it does regarding the Project.

9 130. The REIR improperly claims that the MVU has projected for the additional planned
10 logistics centers when it apparently has not.

13 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS

14 131. As noted in the attached Declaration of Thomas Owings, this Project is highly unlikely to
15 employ any significant number of Moreno Valley residents; as he states, the Skechers facility

16 only employed 35 out of its 600 workers from the City according to its General Manager. This

17 not only means that the Project's air quality impacts are severely underestimated, it also has
18 significant environmental justice implications, because the additional burdens on the health of
19
Moreno Valley and surrounding communities' residents will not be offset by new economic
20

21 opportunities.

22 132. As we pointed out previously, warehousing and logistics jobs pay less than a living wage,

23 regardicss of whether the employces are temporary (51% are temporary, according to a 2015

24 UCLA study) or permanent, because the annual income these jobs generate in either event puts
25 them under the federal poverty line for a family of three. So even if local residents were hired,
26 the income generated would hardly set off the worsened health outcomes for the community.
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 43

Studies show that most of these workers won't get health insurance, and even if they do, they

2 may not get it for their families.
3 133. As we stated in our comment letter, the site of the WLC is one of very few remaining
4
non-logistics or industrial uses within the City. The REIR should have evaluated the impacts to
5

6 the City of the lost opportunity for its residents to be in a more livable environment.

7 134. As the Attorncy General's Officc noted in its Amicus Brief relating to this Project, the
8 Project will be built in a census tract in the 75th to 80th percentile of census tracts in California
9 in terms of the greatest pollution burden indicators and health and vulnerability factors according
10 to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA") CalEnviroScreen 3.0
11

12 tool, Even without the Project, the census tract alrcady has ozone at a rate higher than 98% of the

13 rest of California, and they have cardiovascular a disease at a rate higher than 95% of the state,

14 which is likely attributable to their air pollution burden, The census tract has low birthweight

15 babies at a rate greater than 82% of the state8. With its significant GHG impacts, the Project will

16 only make these things worsc, The City needs to consider these issues in connection with

17 amendments to its General Plan addressing environmental justice, and it should do so now.
18 135. A recent report from Jones Lange LaSalle IP, Inc. discusses the state of the logistics
19

20 industry in Southern California: The low unemployment rates in the Inland Empire reflect that

21 the Project will nced to find workers who take long commutes, and that Moreno Valley's

22 residents will not benefit from the Project. Further, the increased demand for IE warehouse space

23 projects further significant impacts in this alrcady pollution-burdened arca, in terms of further

24 criteria pollutants, TACs, and GHGs.

25 136. Government Code section 11135(a) requires local agencies to consider environmental
26 justice impacts on their residents, and section 11136 requires administrative hearings by the state
27

28 8 In the City as a whole, over half the census tracts score above the 61 st percentile for asthma, and only four of the City's census
tracts are below the 92.89th percentile for PM2.5.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 44

to decide whether a violation has occurred. Funding to the local agency may be curtailed by the

2 state because of a violation, and section 11135 may be enforced via a civil action for equitable
relief. Gov. Code §§ 11137, 11139. Further, under CEQA, the City must "[t]ake all action
4
necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water, cnjoyment of aesthetic,
5

6 natural, scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise." Pub.

7 Res. Code § 21001(b). We urge the City to take its responsibilities seriously this time.

8 137. Finally, if this Project goes forward in severely modified form in the future, the City must

9 mitigate its impacts by providing better education for its students, so they can obtain the jobs the
10 Project will offer.
11 138. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's REIR fails to provide adequate identification
12

13 and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the analysis of

14 alternatives in the REIR nor Respondents' certification of the REIR in this respect is supported

15 by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

16 139. CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives," Guidelines §

17 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if to some
18 degree they would limit accomplishment of the Project's objectives, or would be more costly.
19
Guidelines §15126.6(b).
20

21 140. Respondents failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that lessened

22 the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential alternatives to

23 the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic

24 objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the significant
25 effects." Guidclines § 15126.6(c).
26 141. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification 27

28 and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 45

fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither the analysis of mitigation

2 measures nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by substantial
3 evidence in the administrative record.

4

5 142. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will substantially

6 lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those mitigation

7 measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code $§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines § 15126.4. A

8 lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable without requiring the

9 imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reducc impacts to less than significant levels.
10 Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.
11 143. CEQA also requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding considerations"
12

13 for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of insignificance by

14 mitigation mcasures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find "that specific
15 overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project outweigh the
16 significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The statement of overriding
17 considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.5;
18 Guidelines § 15093(b).
19

20 144. Respondents adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible mitigation

21 measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21081;

22 Guidelines § 15092. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings regarding the

23 Project's impacts. Respondents also approved the Project based on one or morc written findings
24 that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse environmental
25 impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to support all such
26 findings. Moreover, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more non-written
27

28 findings that such considerations exist.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 46

F 145. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that the

2 decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of
3 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner
4
and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental 5

6 impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.

7

8
WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays 9

10 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondents to set aside

11 its decision certifying the REIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9,
12 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);

13 2. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondents to fully
14 comply with the requirements of CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and the applicable
15
Municipal Code prior to any future approval of the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
16

17 21168.9, Gov. Code § 65300 et seq., Code of Civil Procedure $§ 1085, 1094.5);

18 3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondents by CEQA to
19 adequately address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the environment in any
20 subsequent action taken regarding the Project;
21 4. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondents by CEQA to
22 adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent action taken to
23
approve the Project; 24

25 5. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the Respondents by CEQA 10
26 adopt a feasible environmentally superior alternative to reduce significant impacts in any
27 subsequent action taken to approve the Project;

Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 2

2. Section 9 of RESOLUTION 2020- Approved and Adopted by the Moreno Valley City Council on June 16, 2020 also included: REPEAL OF RESOLUTION NO. 2015-56 "That Resolution No. 2015-56 which certified the previous Final EIR and adopted findings, the MMRP and the Statement of Overriding Considerations, is hereby repealed and set aside as ordered by Hon. Judge Waters in the Peremptory Writ of Mandate dated June 12, 2018 (Case No: RIC 1510967 [MFJ)
5

6 3• The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report for the World Logistics Center is the second attempt by the City of Moreno Valley to comply with the Riverside County Superior Court Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate setting aside the August 2015 Final Environmental Impact Report
c0 (FEIR) for the World Logistics Center (WLC). The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact was preceded by the July 2018 Revised Sections of the FEIR (RSFEIR) circulated to the public for review and comment by the City of

10 Moreno Valley. The July 2018 RSFEIR and the City's responses to public comments on that document are incorporated into the subject Revised Final

11 Environmental Impact Report.

12 4. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the "take" (Kill, capture

13 or habitat destruction) of listed endangered or threatened species. In a like manner, the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) prohibits the "take" of

14 endangered or threatened species listed by the California Fish and Game Commission. Under the 2004 Western Riverside County Multiple Species

15 Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) / Natural Communities Conservation Plan (NCCP Act) the "take" of 146 plant and animal species is permitted for 75

16 years throughout western Riverside County, in exchange for the assembly and management of coordinated MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Areas. The most
17 prominent Conservation Area is the California Department of Fish and Wildlife

18 (CDFW) San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) located immediately on the southern boundary of the proposed World logistics Center (WLC).

19 5. Both the federal and state endangered species statutes provide for exceptions

20 to their "take" prohibitions. The federal exception requires applicants to submit a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). If approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

21 Service, the applicant will be issued an incidental «take" permit (the

22 MSHCP). The California "take" exception is authorized pursuant to the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act (Fish and Game Code §§ 2800-

23 2835). After approval of a NCCP Act Conservation Plan, the CDFW permits the "take" of covered species whose conservation and management is provided for in

24 the NCCP approved by CDFW. The NCCP Act section 2826 provides: "Nothing in this chapter exempts a project proposed in a natural community planning

25 area from Division 13 (commencing with section 21000) of the Public Resources

26 Code [CEQA - California Environmental Quality Act] or otherwise alters the applicability of that division.'

27

28 Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 3

1 6. In performing the necessary/required analysis of the WLC impacts on

2 Biological Resources the City of Moreno Valley must acknowledge/recognize the City is a signatory to the 1995 Stephens' Kangaroo Rat Habitat Conservation Plan
m (SKRHCP) and the 2004 Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP/NCCP). Most importantly, the City of Moreno Valley must acknowledge/recognize the San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) immediately

5 adjacent to the southern boundary of the World logistics Center project site, is the principle designated Conservation Area/Reserve for both of these "take"

6 permits, Both the initial August 2015 Final EIR and the subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report failed to address the mandatory significant

~ impact of the "take" of MSHCP Covered Species (CEQA Guideline § 15065(a)(1)(3)) in accordance with the mandates of CEQA.
1O 00 7. The subject Revised Final ETR fails to follow the substantives mandates of CEQA and consequently fails to require adoption of feasible mitigation measures

10 and alternatives that would lessen or avoid significant impacts to Biological Resources. Petitioners accordingly request that this Court issue a writ of

11 mandate under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §8 1085 and 1094-5 directing Respondent to vacate and set aside the approvals of the WLC Project and

12 certification of the Revised Final EIR.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14

15 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094-5, 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and

16 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

17 9. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because

18 Respondent and the proposed site of the WLC Project are located in Riverside
County,

19 THE PARTIES
20

21 10. Petitioner/Plaintiff ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK (Paulek) is a retired (28.5 years) Department of Fish and Wildlife Associate Wildlife Biologist and was the

22 area manager of the Department's San Jacinto wildlife Area (SJWA) from 1991 to

23 2006. Paulek is a Certified Wildlife Biologist having extensive knowledge and experience working with the wildlife resources and conservation programs of

24 western Riverside County and the state of California. Paulek participated in the CEQA review of the WLC Project as an individual and as the Conservation Chair

25 of the Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley, Petitioners seek to compel the City of Moreno Valley to properly implement its CEQA duties to avoid and

26 Mitigate Project impacts to the plant and animal resources of western Riverside County and the state of California and to conserve existing and future wildlife

27 habitat values of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area.

28

12. Petitioners presented written and oral comments and objections during the administrative hearings on the matter being challenged in this petition. Petitioners and their members would be directly, adversely and irreparably affected if the Project proceeds. Petitioners would continue to be prejudiced by

8 the project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition,

9 13. Respondent CITY OF MORENO VALLEY was incorporated in 1984 as a
10 general law city. A council-manager government governs the City. The City is divided into five districts, each of which elects a representative to the City
11 Council. On June 16, 2020 the Moreno Valley City Council voted to approve the

12 WLC Development Agreement, Tentative Parcel Map 36457 and certified the Revised Final Environmental Impact Report for the World Logistics Center.

17. Does 21-50, inclusive, are persons presently unknown to petitioners and who have a legal interest in the project being challenged herein, or are real property owners, developers, or others with a legal or equitable interest in the real property at issue herein. Petitioner will amend this petition to specifically identify each such respondent as required and as capacity and identity of each such respondent becomes known.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

18. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in paragraph 1 through 17 inclusive.
LD 00 19. The public lands of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area immediately south and contiguous with the WLC Specific Plan southern boundary were acquired by the

10 Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) in fee simple in May 2001. The WCB minutes of May 18, 2001* indicates the acquisition of these public lands were

11 funded using the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2000 (Proposition 12).

12

13 20. The May 18, 2001 WCB minutes indicate funding for these SJWA wildlife conservation lands was made pursuant to Proposition 12 § 5096.350 (a) (3) T &E

14 for the restoration or acquisition from a willing seller of habitat for threatened and endangered species or for the purpose of promoting the recovery of those

15 species. Proposition 12 made the funds available for the expenditure by the WCB

16 for "acquisition, development, rehabilitation, restoration and protection of real property benefiting fish and wildlife, for the acquisition, restoration, or

17 protection, of habitat that promotes the recovery of threatened, endangered or fully protected species, maintain the genetic integrity of wildlife populations and

18 serves as corridors linking otherwise separate habitat to prevent habitat fragmentation..".

19 21. The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) was

20 created in 2004 to implement the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan

21 (MSHCP), The MSHCP impetus is to assure the conservation of 146 species of plants and animals on designated reserve lands [the SJWA is the most significant

22 MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Reserve] in order to mitigate the "take" [loss] of species incidental to the development of lands not designated for MSHCP/NCCP

23 conservation. Similarly, the SKR Habitat Conservation Plan [state and federal endangered species "take" permits] includes the SUWA as a primary "Core"

24 reserve to mitigate the incidental habitat impact resulting from the development of lands not designated for SKR conservation.

25

26 Submitted with Petitioner's comment letters on the Draft EIR, April 5, 2013 and the Final EIR, June 9, 2015 for 27| inclusion in the administration record.
28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 6

22. Of the 1.26 million acres covered by the MSHCP/NCCP, 500,000 acres are designated for wildlife conservation. Of that half million acres, 347,000 acres
2 were already conserved as public or quasi-public land. The acquisition of the remaining 153,000 acres [additional Reserve Lands] for MSHCP/NCCP wildlife
3 conservation is the primary function of the RCA. After the 2004 approval of the MSHCP/NCCP, the 2001 WCB Proposition 12 SJWA land acquisition of approximately 1,000 acres was immediately included in the MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Area and counted as Additional Reserve Lands.

23. In February 2012 the CEQA Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the initial WLC Draft EIR [the Draft/Final EIR the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate subsequently repealed and set aside] was circulated to the public, Trustee and Responsible

8 agencies for comment. Petitioners March 22, 2012 NOP response letter advised the City of Moreno Valley that the NOP was deceptive in that the WLC Specific Plan wrongly identified the public lands acquired by the WCB in May 2001 as the CDFW Conservation Buffer Area. Similarly, the March 22, 2012 NOP
10 response letter from the California Department of Fish and Game?, the state agency having jurisdiction by law over fish and wildlife resources, advised the
11 City of Moreno Valley regarding the defective Project description, the need for

12 compliance with the requirements of CEQA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP and the incidental "take" permits for endangered, threatened and/or candidate species

13 (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.).

14 24. The initial Draft EIR [repealed and set aside by the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate] was released for public and agency review in February 2013. The
15 CEQA review presented by the City of Moreno Valley and the Project proponent

16 fashioned straw man fallacies using the "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" and the proposed SJWA "Open Space" designation. In doing so they sought to avoid
17 addressing the mandatory signiflcant impacts to biological resources the WLC project will realize. The straw man fallacies were presented in the EIR to avoid
18 the required CEQA consideration of significant impacts to the public lands of the SJWA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP, and the wildlife conservation mandates of the
19 state of California.

20 25. The Revised Final Environmental Impact Report (Draft Recirculated

21 RSFEIR), the subject of this CEQA challenge, misrepresents the 2018 Ruling on the Peremptory Writ of Mandate wrongly asserting:
22 "The Judge found that substantial portions of the FEIR did comply with CEQA
23 so that, only portions of the RSFEIR had to be circulated for public review and comment." (Draft Recirculated RSFEIR pages 2-2 and 2-3)
24

25 No such assertion occurs anywhere in Judge Waters ruling. To the contrary Judge Waters ruling specifically states:
26
The Department's name was changed to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) on January 1, 27 2013.
28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 7

"In issuing this writ and its February 8, 2018 Ruling, the Court does not make the required finding, including finding of severability, under Public Resources Code section 21168.9(b) partially limiting this writ to a portion of a determination, finding, or to the specific activity or activities found to in noncompliance. For these reasons, the EIR is voided in whole." [emphasis added] (June 14, 2018 Peremptory Writ of Mandate).

Gt 26. The City of Moreno Valley assertion that only portions of the RSFEIR had to be circulated for public review and comment is false. The City's current falsehood

a 0 is analogous to the City's use of the term "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" in the analysis of the Biological Resource section of the challenged 2015 Final EIR. The Court ruling on the Writ of Mandate agrees the City's analysis "distorts CEQA analysis of the impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources and

10 habitats on the adjacent San Jacinto Wildlife Area and Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) lands." The court agrees

11 the "false labeling* .."gives the false impression that the area [CDFW

12 Conservation Buffer] can be considered mitigation of significant impacts on biological resources and habitat." Most importantly the Court orders all

13 references to the false "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" should be removed and the ". potential environmental impacts on biological resources and habitats

14 should be re-unalyzed without any consideration of said buffer area.' [emphasis added] (February 8, 2018 Ruling on Peremptory Writ of Mandate)

15 27. The Çity of Moreno Valley has yet to re-analyze the direct, indirect and

16 cumulative impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources. Petitioners have

17 exhausted all administrative remedies since the initiation of the WLC Project in 2012 by submitting written and oral comments to the City of Moreno Valley prior

18 to the Project approvals to request compliance with CEQA and the completion of a full and adequate environmental review. All issues raised in this petition were

19 raised before Respondent by Petitioners, other members of the public, or publie agencies prior to the approval of the project.

20

21 28. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service of a notice upon the City of Moreno Valley indicating its intent to file

22 this petition. Proof of Service of this notification with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

23 29. Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-

24 captioned proceedings or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation

25 pursuant to Pub. Res. Code  21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.

26 30, Petitioners have served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's

27 office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is attached as Exhibit C.

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 8

2 31. Petitioners have filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied with Pub. Res. Code 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D,
32. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112.
33. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the following ways:
6

n c0 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF CEQA (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000, et seq.)
The City of Moreno Valley did not Comply with CEQA

10 34• Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
11

12 35• In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature declared it is the policy of the state to: "prevent the elimination of fish and

13 wildlife species due to man's activities, insure that fish and wildlife populations

14 do not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generation representatives of all plant and animal communities...' (Public Resources Code

15 § 21001(c)). "Public agencies should not approve projects if there are feusible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures, which would substantially

16 lessen significant environmental effects of such projects, and that the procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in

17 systematically identifying both the significant effects of the proposed project

18 and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." [emphasis added]

19 (Public Resources Code § 21002), The purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to identify the Significant effects on the environment, to

20 identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in which those

21 significant effects can be mitigated or avoided.' [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002.1(a).

22 36. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that Complies

23 with the requirements of the Statute. The Lead ageney must also provide for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental

24 documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when

25 acting on proposed projects. The City of Moreno Valley certification of the WLC Revised Final Environmental Impact Report constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

26 discretion. .the policy of the state that noncompliance with the information

27 disclosure provisions of this division [CEQA] which precludes relevant information from being presented to the public agency, or noncompliance

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 9

with substantive requirements of this division, may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion..."[emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21005(a)).
2 37. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Respondents:

4 a. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the projects impacts on the
1O environment, including but not limited to, the project's impacts on Biological Resources, the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, the MSHCP and the SKRHCP.
b. Failed to provide a stable, consistent and adequate description of the project,
T which prohibited an accurate depiction of the project's impacts on the environment.
DO
O C. Failed to provide an adequate description of existing environmental settings of the project, vicinity, and regional context.
10 d. Failed to adopt a consistent and appropriate environmental "baseline" for
11 analysis of the project's environmental impacts that contributed to the EIR's flawed analysis of environmental impacts.
12
e. Failed to adequately identify and analyze the project's biological resource 13 impacts-including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the SJWA, the MSHCP, the SKRHCP and wildlife resources. 14

15 f. Failed to adequately identify, analyze and adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives that would minimize direct, indirect and cumulative impacts
16 on biological resources.

17 g. Improperly relied upon regional plans to avoid full disclosure and mitigation of the project's impacts. 18

19 h. Improperly deterred impact analysis and mitigation measures in contravention of CEQA requirements that mitigation measures be clearly defined and
20 enforceable.

21 i. Failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or avoid significant impacts in direct contravention of CEQA substantive mandate that all 22 feasible mitigation measures be adopted to avoid or reduce : project's significant
23 and potentially significant impacts.

24 j. Failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by improperly dismissing feasible alternatives, including those recommended by the public, trustee and
25 responsible agencies and relying upon an improperly narrow list of project objectives to justify the elimination of feasible alternatives. 26

27

10 28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek

k. Failed to properly disclose, analyze or mitigation conflicts with existing local, state and federal laws.

2 1. Failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by the public and governmental agencies during review of the EIR.
m. Failed to recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR, despite the availability of

5 significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.
6
n. Failed to adopt an adequate Mitigating Monitoring and Reporting Program in
7 order to assure that the mitigation measures and program revisions identified in

8 the EIR are implemented.

9 0. Failed to adopt adequate findings that alternatives to the project and proposed mitigation measures and alternatives that would have avoided or lessened the
10 significant impacts of the project were infeasible and failed to disclose the readily available mitigation measures and alternatives that would meet the basic
11 project objectives.

12 38. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
13 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification
14 of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. On August 19, 2015, the City Council for the City of Moreno Valley ("City") approved the

3 World Logistics Center Project ("Project") -- a 2,610 acre, 40+ million square foot warehouse

4 complex that would be larger than New York's Central Park and may be the largest development of

5 its kind in the world. On the same day, the City also approved a final environmental impact report

6 (*Final EIR") that purports but fails to analyze the widespread impacts of the Project's construction

7 and operation.

8 2. Several entities challenged this approval under the California Environmental Quality Act

9 ("CEQA"). In 2018, Riverside County Superior Court issued a ruling in Petitioners' CEQA action
10 identifying deficiencies in five issue areas in the FEIR: energy, biological resources and habitat,
11 noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. This matter is being considered by the Court of Appeals.
12 3. In July 2018, the City released a document entitled Revised Sections of the Final

13 Environmental Impact Report ("RSFEIR"), and in December 2019, the City released a document
14 entitled Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Draft
15 Recirculated RSFEIR").

16 In April 2020, the City released a Revised Final Environmental Impact Report (the "Revised

17 FEIR") containing its Response to Comments on and revisions to the RSFEIR and Draft

18 Recirculated RSFEIR.

19 5. On or about May 15, 2020, the City's Planning Commission certified the Revised FEIR,

20 approved a tentative parcel map for the Project, and recommended approval of a Development
21 Agreement for the Project.

22 6. Two appeals were filed, including an appeal by the Petitioners filing this lawsuit.
23 7. On June 16, 2020, the City Council denied the appcals of the Planning Commission's actions
24 and approved both the Revised FEIR and the tentative parcel map.
25 8. On July 7, 2020, the City Council approved the Development Agreement for this Project.
26 Due to the size of the Project, the City's action to approve the World Logistics Center
27 commits approximately 10% of the City's total land mass to be developed and used solely for
28 warehouses and distribution centers, or other logistics support, indefinitely. If the Project is

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

constructed and operated as planned, residents of the City and its surrounding areas will see a future

2 that is dominated by large-scale massive warehouse developments, increased truck shipments and

3 traffic, and even worse air quality than they already experience.

4 10. Several governmental agencies, organizations, and individuals expressed deep concerns

5 about the Project and the associated environmental review conducted by the City throughout the

6 City's decision-making process. These concerns were also echoed by the California Air Resources

7 Board ("ARB"), which was just as concerned about the implications of the Project's dramatic

8 increase in heavy-duty truck traffic, and the resulting public health impacts that could not be

9 addressed by the City's currently proposed mitigation measures, set forth in the Revised FEIR. The

10 California Department of Fish and Wildlife also expressed significant concerns about the impacts of
11 the Project on biological resources.

12 11. As noted in the comments submitted by these entities and individuals, including Petitioners
13 and Plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Petitioners"), as well as others, there are
14 myriad concerns stemming from the Project's environmental and public health impacts. The size of

15 the Project alone, with its estimated thousands of truck trips per day, will substantially add to the
16 existing presence of ozone, ozone precursors, and other contaminants, such as carcinogenic dicsel
17 particulate matter, in an air basin that already suffers from some of the worst air quality in the nation.
18 This additional air pollution will only exacerbate the serious, direct health impacts already
19 experienced by nearby residents, including the impacts of Covid-19, as well as impacts from noise
20 caused by the construction and operation of the Project. In addition, the Project will contribute

21 unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions that will add to, rather than reduce

22 climate change impacts. As a result, the Project directly conflicts with existing State GHG reduction

23 goals. The Project will also imposc severe and detrimental impacts to a variety of imperiled species,
24 habitats and other biological resources. Yet, the Project's environmental review document and the

25 City's environmental review process have failed to adequately address these impacts.
26 12. The City has also failed to require re-circulation of the EIR in light of critical information

27 that must be analyzed in the document, and for which the public must be allowed the opportunity to
28 provide comments. These and many additional fatal flaws in the Revised FEIR's analyses have led

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioners and their organizational members to become deeply concerned by the City's decision to

2 approve this Project. Given the scope and significant impacts of the Project, it is critical that the City

3 comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

4 Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of

5 Regulations, section 15000 et seq., before moving forward on a project of this scale. To date, the

6 City has failed to do so.

7 13, As a result, Petitioners bring this action on their behalf, on behalf of their members, the

8 general public, and in the public interest, to compel the City to adhere to CEQA's critical

9 environmental review and mitigation requirements designed to maintain a high-quality, healthy
10 environment for all Californians.

11 Il. PARTIES

12 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

13 JUSTICE ("CCAEJ"*) is a membership-based California non-profit environmental health and justice

14 organization with its primary membership in and around Riverside County. CCAEJ's mission is to
15 bring people together to improve their social and natural environment, and to build community
16 power in order to create safer, healthier, toxic free placcs to live, work, learn and play in and around
17 the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino. CCAEJ has its physical offices in Jurupa Valley and

18 organizes to build leadership for community action in Jurupa Valley, Mira Loma, in the City and the

19 Count of Riverside, as well as other cities throughout the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino.

20 CCAEJ has identified the City as a "community at risk" for various environmental injustices

21 including bearing a disproportionate share of the impacts from high polluting industries, heavy-duty

22 diesel truck and other mobile source emissions, and suffering other disparities created by zoning and

23 irresponsible land use planning. Accordingly, CCAEJ, together with co-petitioners to this action and

24 other environmental groups, filed extensive comments that are part of the administrative record for
25 the City's approval of the Project and Revised FEIR. CCAEJ's members are extremely concerned

26 that the Project will detrimentally impact their health and wellbeing, and the health and wellbeing of

27 their children, their community, and the environment, and that it will detrimentally impact the area's
28 surrounding resources. Most of CCAEJ's members who reside in and around Riverside County and

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEP

- around the proposed site for the Project already suffer a disproportionate burden from existing
2 stationary and mobile sources of pollution, including significant air pollution from, inter alia, the

3 movement of goods throughout the region to existing warehouses and other large-scale storage and

4 distribution centers.

LO 15, Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a

6 nonprofit corporation with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere throughout
7 California and the United Stätes. The Center is actively involved in environmental protection issues

8 throughout California and North America and has over 70,000 members, including many throughout

9 California and in Riverside County, The Center's mission includes protecting and restoring habitat
10 and populations of imperiled species, reducing GHG pollution to preserve a safe climate, and
11 protecting air quality, water quality, and public health. The Center's members and staff include
12 individuals who regularly use and intend to continue to use the areas in Riverside County and
13 elsewhere affected by the Project, including numerous members who are particularly interested in
14 protecting the native, endangered, imperiled, and sensitive species and habitats found in the San
15 Jacinto Wildlife Area ("SJWA"), that will be detrimentally impacted by the construction and
16 operation of the Project, As such, the Center has submitted extensive comments to the City,
17 throughout its decision-making process regarding the Project, which are now part of the
18 administrative record of the City's decision to approve the Project and its Revised FEIR.
19 16. Petitioner and Plaintiff COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR ("CCA") is a California nonprofit
20 organization that is dedicated to restoring clean healthy air to California by advocating for effective
21 public policy and practical business solutions. For the past 50 years CCA has made significant
22 improvements to California's air by advocating for innovative policy solutions through both state
23 and fedcral legislation; encouraging the carly adoption of new technologies; advising businesses on
24 regulatory compliance and clean ait practices; and empowering its allies with technical and policy
25 expertise to educate decision-makers and the public on air pollution solutions. CCA has offices in
26 Los Angeles and Sacramento, and has a direct interest in protecting and improving the quality of the
27 air in Southern California and throughout the State. As such, CCA submitted comments to the City,

2 during its decision-making process regarding the Project, which are now part of the administrative

3 record of the City's decision to approve the Project and its Reyised Final EIR.
17.

4 Petitioner and Plaintiff STERRA CLUB is a national nonprofit organization of approximately

5 799,000 members. Sierra Club is dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of

6 the earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to
educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human
7 environment; and to using all lawful means

8 to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club's particular

0 interest in this case stems from the Sierra Club's local San Gorgonio Chapter's interests in

10 preserving the native, endangered, imperiled and sensitive species and wildlifc habitats of the

11 SJWA; decreasing rather than increasing heavy-duty and medium-duty truck traffic in an already

12 highly overburdened air basin; and ensuring that good, livable, and healthy jobs are brought to the

13 area. The members of the San Gorgonio Chapter live, work, and recreate in an around the areas that

14 will be directly affected by the construction and operation of the Project. Sierra Club submitted

15 extensive comments to the City throughout its environmental review process for the Project, which

16 are part of the City's record of its decision to approve the Project and its Revised Final EIR.

18.

17 Petitioner and Plaintiff SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY AUDUBON SOCIETY ("SBVAS")

18 is a local chapter of the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit corporation that focuses on inspiring
and mobilizing people nationwide to protect hundreds of bird species and their habitats through
19  conservation, education and advocacy efforts. Founded in 1948, the SBVAS chapter area covers
20 almost all of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including the Project site. The SBVAS chapter

21

22 has approximately 2,000 members, about half of whom live in Riverside County and regularly

23 engage in the bird watching, conservation, education and advocacy activities to protect bird species

24 in and around the arca where the Project construction and operation will take place. The SBVAS'

25 mission extends beyond the preservation of bird species and includes the preservation of imperiled

26 and sensitive habitats throughout the area for all wildlife, and maintenance of the quality of life in

27 the Inland Empire. As such, the SBVAS chapter is particularly concerned with the impacts that the

28 construction and operation of the Project will have on various species, including but not limited to,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

r bird species in the SJWA, in and around the City and throughout Riverside and San Bernardino

2 counties.

3 19. By this action, Petitioners seek to protect the health, welfare, and economic interests of their

4 members and the general public and to enforce the City's duties under CEQA. Petitioners' members

5 and staff have an interest in their health and well-being, in the health and well-being of others,

6 including the residents of the City, its surrounding areas in Riverside County, and in the region.

7 Petitioners also have a strong interest in conserving and protecting the environment, the aesthetic

8 and ecological integrity of the areas surrounding the Project arca, and economic interests in

9 Riverside County. Petitioners' staff and members who live and work near the Project also have a
10 right to and a beneficial interest in the City's compliance with CEQA. These interests have been, and

11 continue to be, threatened by the City's decision to certify the Revised FEIR and approve the Project
12 in violation of CEQA. Unless the relief requested in this case is granted, Petitioners' staff and
13 members will continue to be adversely affected and irreparably injured by the City's failure to

14 comply with CEQA.
15 20. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF MORENO VALLEY is a municipally funded, general
16 law City, incorporated, organized and existing under the laws of the state of California since the year

14 approved a tentative parcel map to be governed by both the Specific Plan and the City's
15 development agreement for the purpose of financing the Project's approved activities.
16 30. Petitioners are also informed and believe and on that basis allege that the MORENO
17 VALLEY COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRCIT ("CSD") is a governmental body within the City,
18 established pursuant to the Community Services Law (Cal Gov. Code section 6100 et seq.). CSD is a

19 dependent special district of the City and the City's five-member City Council serves as its Board of

20 Directors, CSD is responsible for setting forth certain funding mechanisms and services within the

21 territory covered by the Project and subject to Project related approvals within the territory and
22 jurisdiction of the City.

23 31. Pctitioners arc informed and on that basis believe that CSD's staff, contractors and

14 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 41. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside under Code of Civil

16 Procedure section 395 because the City, its City Council and the proposed project are currently

17 located, or will be located in Riverside County.

18 42. Venue is also proper in the Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394.

19 43. The action is filed in the Riverside Historic Courthouse, 4050 Main Street, Riverside, 92501,

20 in accordance with the Standing Administrative Order - Where to File Documents - dated

21 September 16, 2019, which requires all CEQA Petitions for Writ of Mandate to be filed in this

22 Courthouse.

23 44. The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168

24 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or in the alternative, pursuant to Public Resources Code

25 section 21168.5 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085).

26 45. This petition has been filed within 30 days of the filing and posting of the City's Notice of

9 environmental review and mitigation requirements in approving the Revised FEIR for the Project
10 and by the ensuing environmental and public health consequences that will be caused by the
11 construction and operation of the Project, as approved.

12 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

13 A. Community and Environmental Setting
14 49. Moreno Valley spans a total of 51.5 square miles of the Western portion of Riverside
15 County, located in the Inland Empire. It is surrounded by the cities of Riverside and Perris, the
16 March Air Reservc Basc, Lake Pcrris and Lakc Pcrris Statc Park, the San Timotco Badlands, and the
17 SJWA - an approximately 19,000-acre state conservation area, a portion of which shares an

18 approximately 2 mile border with the Project.

19 50. The City has a population of approximately 210,639 residents,' a small fraction of the over 2
20 million people living in Riverside County who will be subject to the immediate and direct
21 environmental impacts of the Project.
22 51. In the past several years, Riverside County and, specifically, the portion of the County where
23 the City is located, have scen a dramatic influx of large-scalc warchouse devclopment, impacting the
24 health of its residents, and the environment.

1 52. The City is already home to one of the largest warehouses in - the region - a 1.82 million

2 square foot distribution center - and, in addition to the Project, will likely see at least two other

3 large-scale warehouse developments in the very near future.

4 53. Notably, Riverside County and the City are over 80 miles away from the nearest ports, yet,

5 much of the area's recent development has been geared towards receiving goods from those ports,

6 for storage, sale, and distribution.

7 54. As a result of increased and continued industrial growth throughout the Inland Empire,
8 including a growing concentration of storage and distribution centers throughout Riverside County

0 and in the City, vehicle and truck traffic throughout the area has increased, causing severe traffic

10 issues on Riverside County roads, and along the region's interstate highways.
11 55. Indeed, the rapid increase in the construction and operation of warehouses, storage and
12 distribution centers in the area has been recognized as an environmental, public health and policy
13 concern by California government agencies and the State's executive officers, including the
14 Attorney General and the ARB. On the basis of comment letters filed by these agencies, Petitioners I5 are informed and therefore believe that these State officers and agencies are especially concerned

16 with the lack of environmental review conducted to analyze the environmental consequences of
17 large-scale commercial sales, storage and distribution centers like the Project, and the lack of
18 consideration for the traffic, air pollution and public health impacts these projects bring with them.
19 56. The part of Riverside County where the City is located falls under the jurisdiction of the
20 SCAQMD - the regional air pollution control agency with authority to regulate the "critical air

21 pollution problems" throughout the South Coast Air Basin ("Basin"), which includes all of Orange
22 County and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. (Health

23 & Safety Code § 40402(b).)

24 57. SCAQMD is specifically responsible for clean air planning in and throughout the Basin,
25 pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The air quality planning SCAQMD conducts is critical to meeting
26 national air pollution control standards set forth under the Clean Air Act, including the National
27 Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") aimed at reducing the presence of contaminants of

28 concern that severely impact public health and the environment, which contribute to climate change.

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 These contamninants include but are not limited to, nitrogen oxide ("NOx"), particulate matter

3 (*PM*), which produces soot, ground-level ozone (or "smog"), and ozone precursors that are highly

4 prevalent throughout the Basin, and specifically in the Western portion of Riverside County where
the City is, and where the Project will be located.

5 58.

6 The Basin experiences complex and significant air quality issues caused by an extremely

7 high concentration of a variety of industrial activities and on-road vehicle traffic including diesel

8 emissions from heavy-duty truck traffic. As a result, the Basin exceeds federal public health

4 standards for both ozone and PM, resulting in its residents experiencing some of the worst air
pollution in the nation.

10 59.

11 The Western portion of Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the area specifically

12 surrounding the City have been identified as air pollution hot spots by air quality regulators

13 including SCAQMD for decades. This area suffers some of the worst PM concentrations in the

14 nation as a result of pollution blowing in from both Los Angeles and Orange counties, combined

15 with high concentrations of air pollution from other sources farther east that become trapped by

16 surrounding mountain ranges. The area has also experienced worsening air quality as a result of
increased diesel pollution from trucks used to transport goods into the region's growing number of
17 warehouses and other storage and distribution facilities. Notably, diesel exhaust, or diesel particulate
18 matter ("DPM"), which is highly prevalent throughout the Basin and throughout Riverside and San
19 Bernardino counties, contains dangerous levels of PM, carbon, soot, and other harmful and

20 carcinogenic contaminants that can cause a host of short-term acute exposure impacts such as
21 respiratory diseases, including asthma, and lung cancer.

22 60.

23 ARB, the state agency charged with monitoring the regulatory activity of California's 35

24 local air districts including SCAQMD, has determined that diesel exhaust is responsible for over 70

25 percent of the health risks associated with air pollution statewide. SCAQMD has likewise

26 determined that DPM accounts for over 68 percent of the health risks associated with breathing air in
and around the Basin.

27 61. Consistent and continued exposure to DPM is, therefore, a serious concern for Basin
28 residents and particularly for those residing along heavy-duty truck thoroughfares. Interstate

14

4

2 highway 15 ("I-15") and state route 60 ("SR 60") are just some of the thoroughfares that especially
impact Riverside County, City residents and residents of the areas surrounding the City. Other
3 thoroughfares such as highway 710 ("I-710") and state routes 91 and 22, also impact numerous

4 residents living closer to the ports. These residents suffer impacts from heavy pollution caused by

6 ships and port-based pollution sources in addition to increased truck traffic to ship goods out of the
port area to storage and distribution centers located at far distances. Residents who live along these

8 and other thoroughfares experience some of the region's most concentrated vehicle traffic and

9 breathe some its most polluted air. Most of these residents also lack the financial means to address

10 the health problems caused by these exposures. Children, who are among the most vulnerable

11 residents, are not only subject to these avoidable health impacts, but they also experience some of

12 the highest rates of school absences, which means lost work days for parents and caregivers, all of

13 which only further impacts families and these communities.

62.

14 The introduction of the COVID-19 virus into these communities places them ai even greater

15 risk because people exposed to elevated levels of air pollution face worse outcomes if they contract
the virus.

16 63.

17 In addition to the region's grave DPM, ozone, and other PM emission concentrations, the
Basin and the western portion of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, like the rest of the state, are
18 experiencing increased impacts from climate change including decreasing water supply and rainfall
19 as well as increasing temperatures, which often exacerbate air pollution concentrations.
20 64.

21 GHG emissions contribule to local, regional, and global climate change impacts and, as such,

22 they have been the subject of increased statewide regulatory efforts.
65.

23 ARB and the Governor's office have adopted rigorous goals and standards to decrease the

24 state's GHG cmissions, and to decrease the impacts from climate change. Some of thesc targets havc

25

26

27

28

15
VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

been codified into state law, and others have been declared by executive order, or by agency action.2
2 The thrust of many of the State's most recent efforts has been to actively limit GHG emissions, e

3 recognizing that a pure "business as usual" approach will only exacerbate and accelerate the impacts

4 of climate change, rather than help to reduce and slow its negative consequences.* In setting forth its
5 GHG reduction efforts, the State has emphasized the importance of local agency involvement, and

6 local agency commitments to reducing GHG emissions through their policy and planning processes.
7 Continued coordination between State, regional, and local entities is instrumental to ensuring the

8 efficacy of the State's policies and to enabling the State to reach its reduction targets.

0 66. In addition to impacting human health and resource availability and access over time, climate
10 change also directly impacts the environment, including the presence and viability of numerous
11 biological species and their habitats throughout the State and locally, within Riverside County.
12 Many native, sensitive, and imperiled species and their habitats are found in and around the City,
13 and many are located in the immediate vicinity of the Project.
14 67. The SJWA's total 19,000 acres is home to a number of imperiled biological species, many of
15 which are native to California. Others migrating through the Pacific Flyway - a migratory bird
16 passago that extends from the southernmost tip of South America along the Pacific Occan, to the
17 North Slope of Alaskä - also rely on the SJWA en route. 9,000 acres of the SJWA is also comprised
18 of restored wetlands, which provide critical habitats to these migratory birds as well as terrestrial
19 species that may also migrate to the area in search of limited water.
20 68. Just some of the animal and plant species that are found in the SJWA include: the Burrowing
21 Owl (a species of special concern, whose viability is threatened by continued urban and sub-urban
22

23 See e.g., Health and Safety Code § 38500 et seq., the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 [setting forth a statewide requirement to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 - a
24 reduction of approximately 15 percent below emissions expected under a "business as usual" scenario
25 and requiring ARB to adopt regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost- effective GHG emission reductions; to mitigate risks associated with climate change; improve energy
26 efficiency; and expänd the use of renewable energy resources, cleaner transportation, and waste reduction practices].
27 See id., see also, California State Executive Order B-30-15, April 29, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown [increasing the state's GHG reduction target to achieye 40% below 1990 level reductions by

1 development); the Tri-Colored Blackbird (a bird that has received emergency protection status in
2 2014, and whose population remains in rapid decline); the fully protected California Golden Eagle;
3 25 species of raptors and at least 65 of the 146 species of plants and animals covered by the Western
4 Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan, including the Los Angeles pocket

5 mouse (a threatened and Stale special status species native to the San Bernardino and Riverside

6 County areas). The SJWA is also home to three threatened and endangered plant species such as the
7 Spreading Navarretia, Threadleaved Brodiaea, and the San Jacinto Crownscale.

8 69. A significant portion of the land found in the arca immediately adjacent to the approved

9 Project is used specifically for habitat and specics conservation, and is comprised of the part of the
10 SJWA and reserve lands that are governed by the Western Riverside County Multiple Species
11 Habitat Conservation Plan. In addition to conservation uses, there are a few residences and small
12 family farms in the vicinity of where the Project's 2,610 acre warehouse complex will be constructed
13 and will operate.

14 B. The Project and Its Environmental Impacts

15 70. The Project involves construction and operation of a 40.6 million square foot warehouse

16 complex, which, according to the EIR and other approval documents, will be used to provide a major
17 logistics center to accommodate an undefined "portion" of the trade volumes at the Ports of Los
18 Angeles and Long Beach.

19 71. The total area needed to effectuate the Project's construction and operations include
20 committing almost 4,000 acres within the City to indefinite future use for logistics - receiving and
21 distributing shipments by truck, conducting sales, and offering storage services - or logistics
22 support. Thus, in addition to the 40.6 million square foot or 2,610 acre warehouse envisioned by the
23 Project, the land use changes involved in the Project's approvals commit approximately 10 porcent
24 of the City's total land mass to be developed and used solely for warehouses, distribution centers,
25 and associated facilities indefinitely.

26 72. Given the size and scope of the Project, the Project approvals that bave been or will be issued
27 by the City include the following: a new Specific Plan and Specific Plan Amendment; a General
28 Plan Amendment; pre-annexation zoning changes for land that has not yet been acquired by Real

Parties in Interest, but is located within the Project area and is subject to the City's jurisdiction;

2 éxecution of a development agreement consistent with the construction of the Project as described in

3 its notice and environmental review documents; and adoption or approval of a tentative parcel map

4 1o be governed by the Project's approvals and used for the purpose of financing the Project's
operations,

6 73. As proposed, the Project will also involve drastic deviations from the City's current General
Plan designations and goals, which include, inter alia, (1) properly screening manufacturing and

8 industrial land uses to support mixed-use development and to avoid increased traffic flows as well as

0 disruptive construction and operation; (2) mitigating and minimizing where necessary, increased
10 traffic, noise, light, and glare caused by land use activities; and (3) requiring development along
11 scenic roadways to be visually attractive.

12 74. Because the Project involves construction and operation of a warehouse complex that is so
13 vast in size, the Project will necessarily involve single-use development throughout a vast portion of
14 the City's land; increased traffic flows and will involve disruptive construction and operation as well
15 as high levels of light, fumes, noise, and glare, which will also obstruct scenic views.

16 75. Because the Project will also necessarily attract increased truck and other vehicular traffic,

17 the Project will also significantly impact the air quality in the immediate vicinity of the Project, as
18 well as throughout the City, the County, and the region.

19 76. Moreover, because the Project will be located at least 80 miles away from the nearest port
20 and the only other point of entry for goods that appear likely to be stored at the World Logistics
21 Center is the Ontario Airport, the Project is likely to cause significant impacts along all roadways,
22 thoroughfares, highways and highway corridors linking the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to
23 Moreno Valley,

24 C. The City of Moreno Valley's Initial Project Approval and Environmental Review Process
25 1, The City's Draft EIR

26 77. On February 24, 2013, the City released a Draft EIR for a review and public comment

27 period, which closed on April 8, 2013.

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF

78. Hundreds of members of the public, including Petitioners, submitted extensive comments to

2 the City regarding numerous, severe flaws contained in the Draft EIR's analyses. Such comments

3 expressed serious concerns about the Draft EIR's failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the

4 Project's significant adverse traffic impacts; its failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the

5 Project's significant and adverse impacts to air quality and human health, including the Project's

6 potentially severe DPM and GHG emissions impacts, as well as its growth inducing impacts.
7 79. Numerous public commenters, including Petitioners, also discussed at length the Draft EIR's

8 failurc to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant and adverse impacts on biological

9 resources, including imperiled, sensitive, and endangered species and habitats located in the nearby
10 SJWA. These comments specifically highlighted the Draft EIR's omission of mitigation measures
11 necessary to address the impacts that both construction and operation of the Project will have on the
12 wildlife habitats.

13 2. The City's Final EIR and Draft Statement of Overriding Consideration
14 80. On May 1, 2015, the Final EIR was released for a 45-day comment period. At the same time,
15 the City also prepared and released for comment a draft Statement of Overriding Considerations
16 outlining the overriding cconomic, legal, social, tochnological, or other benefits of the Project that
17 allegedly outweigh the significant effects on the environment.

18 81. Given that the Final EIR failed to address the Draft EIR's deficiencies, Petitioners repeated

19 their concerns about the Final EIR's failure to, inter alia: adequately analyze the Project's impacts in
20 a project-level, rather than a programmatic EIR - again, in light of the project-level details contained
21 11 the City's draft development agreement; its failure to adequately evaluate and mitigate the
22 Project's significant traffic, air quality, public health, and environmental impacts, with specific
23 emphasis on its failure to adequatcly disclose and evaluate the Project's GHG, DPM and other toxic
24 air emissions as well as its failure to adequately analyze the Project's impacts to endangered,
25 imperiled, and sensitive biological species and habitats of the SJWA; and its inclusion of significant

26 new information.

27

28

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

i. Significant New Information and Changes

2 82. Petitioners and other commenters, including ARB, further noted that the Final EIR's

3 inclusion of new information that was omitted from the Draft EIR or unknown at the time of its

4 publication triggered yet another reason to re-draft, re-notice and re-circulate the full Final EIR

5 pursuant to CEQA.

6 83. In particular, the new information, which Petitioners and others noted in comments, was
7 included in the Final EIR but never studied, addressed, or commented on in the Draft EIR includes

8 the following:

9 A mistaken reliance on the use of a set of adjoining parcels of land purchased by the
10 State Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") for conservation purposes relating
11 to the SJWA habitats and species, and which are referred to throughout the Final EIR
12 documents as "CDFW parcels" as a "buffer," and included as part of the Project's
13 "mitigation." Petitioners pointed out the Final EIR's reference to such parcels as a
14 "buffer" was an addition made to the Final EIR document, which was not contained

15 in the Draft EIR, as the Draft EIR described the same parcels as part of the Project.
16 Petitioners pointed out that this amounted to significant new information because it
17 resulted in a complete failure to analyze the true impacts that the Project will have on
18 SJWA and other surrounding areas.

19 New mitigation approaches for impacts, including noise, GHG, and air quality.
20 ii. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Impacts
21 84. The Final EIR also included an additional approach to the Project's GHG emissions, which
22 Petitioners and other commenters noted impermissibly excludes a significant portion of the Project's
23 emissions from consideration under CEQA. The Final EIR claimed that although the Project is
24 estimated to result in almost 400,000 metric tons of GHGs annually, over three quarters of those
25 emissions did not need to be analyzed or mitigated because they are "capped" under California's
26 Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, known as "AB 32" -- an act that requires the ARB to adopt
27 and implement cost-effective "cap and trade" measures to reduce GHG emissions from certain

28 covered sources. ARB has adopted regulations implementing these "cap and trade" measures.

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 85. The Final EIR concluded that because refiners and suppliers of transportation fuels may hold
2 compliance obligations under the AB 32 "cap and trade" regulation, mobile source emissions

3 including emissions from truck traffic did not need to be analyzed or mitigated in the document.

4 86. Notably, however, California law authorizes the "cap and trade" regulation only through the
5 year 2030.

6 87. Petitioners and other commenters thus pointed out that because the Project's GHG emissions

7 would extend beyond the time-frame contemplated by AB 32, and because they dramatically exceed
8 SCAQMD's threshold level of significance for GHG emissions, which is 10,000 metric tons -these

9 emissions, which are many times greater than the applicable CEQA threshold levels, could not be
10 dismissed as less than significant under CBQA based on the claim that they are "capped" under
11 AB32.

12 88. Petitioners and others further pointed out that because those emissions have real, known, and
13 potential impacts, including impacts on climate change, they must be analyzed and mitigated
14 pursuant to CEQA, notwithstanding the "cap and trade" regulation. Petitioners also noted the danger
15 in setting forth this type of analysis, which could, in essence, allow project proponents or lead
16 agencies to evade necessary CEQA review of a project's severe environmental impacts.
17 iii. Additional Errors and Lack of Substantial Evidence

18 89. Finally, Petitioners pointed out that while the City included a Draft Statement of Overriding
19 Considerations, the Statement and its single supporting document - a report that only generally
20 described but did not state in detail how the Project would lead to good, secure, and stable jobs for
21 surrounding area residents - failed to set forth sufficient, detailed information to support the
22 Statement of Overriding Consideration's claims that the City and its residents would be benefitted by
23 the Project, notwithstanding the significant cnvironmental and public health impacts that a Project of
24 this size and scope brings with it.

25 3. The City's Approval of the Final EIR and Statement of Overriding Considerations

6-1 26 90. On June 30, 2015, the Moreno Valley Planning Commission approved the Project with
27 vote, despite Petitioners' arguments and comments regarding the severe flaws in the Final EIR's

28 analyses of the Project's public health, air quality, GHG, and biological species impacts, as well as

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

numerous other flawed points of analyses set forth in the Final EIR. After the City Planning

2 Department issued its approval, and before the Project was to be approved by the City Council,

3 Petitioners and other commenters continued to submit additional comments, emphasizing the need to

4 re-evaluate the Project's impacts and urged the City to reject the Final EIR as drafted.

5 91. After the City Planning Department issued its approval, but before the City Council

6 considered whether it would adopt or reject the Planning Department's approval, Petitioners

7 submitted to the City Council an expert report published by the University of Southern California

8 that refuted many of the claims made in the Draft Statement of Overriding Considerations.

9 192. Numerous other organizations and government agencies including the ARB and SCAQMD,

10 among others, also submitted additional comments to the City during the same time frame.

11 93. On August 19, 2015, the City Council decided to approve the Final EIR and the Project on a
12 3-2 vote. In so doing the City also approved the Statement of Overriding Considerations; Project
13 related entitlements, including a development agreement between the City and Real Parties in
14 Interest; and General Plan and Specific Plan amendments as well as the Specific Plan for the Project

15 area.

16 94. In September 2015, Petitioners and other cnvironmental, labor, and community organizations
17 initiated CEQA litigation in Riverside County Superior Court challenging the Final EIR and the
18 City's approval of the Project.

19 95. While the CEQA challenge was pending, Highland Fairview circulated initiative petitions in
20 the City that, among other things, purported to repeal and approve the development agreement
21 between the City and the Project applicants. On or before November 24, 2015, the City Clerk
22 determined that the initiative petitions contained sufficient signatures and presented the petitions to
23 the City Council. On November 24, 2015, the City Council adopted the initiatives without
24 submitting them to a vote by the people.

25 96. On February 22, 2016, Petitioners filed another petition for writ of mandate in Riverside

26 County Superior Court challenging the City Council's adoption of the development agreement by
27 initiative. The trial court denied the writ petition and entered judgment against Petitioners on
28 September 14, 2016.

22
VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a 97.

2 Petitioners appealed. On August 23, 2018, the Court of Appeal, in a published decision,

3 reversed the Superior Court's judgment and held that a development agreement cannot be adopted

4 by initiative. Center for Community Action & Environmental Justice v. City of Moreno Valley (2018)

5 26 Cal.App.5th 689, review denied (Nov. 28, 2018). On June 12, 2019, the Superior Court issued a

6 writ of mandate directing the City to set aside its adoption of the initiative measure that purported to
approve the development agreement.

7 98.

8 In February 2018, the Riverside County Superior Court issued a ruling in Petitioners' CEQA
action identifying deficiencies in five issue arcas in the FEIR: energy, biological resources and
9 habitat, noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. The Court denied Petitioners' challenge to the

10

11 FEIR's GHG analysis. In June 2018, the Court entered judgment and issued a writ of mandate

12 directing the City to set aside its certification of the FEIR and its approval of a tentative parcel map
for financing and conveyance purposes.

13 99.

14 Petitioners appealed the Superior Court's denial of their challenge to the FEIR's GHG

15 analysis; the City and Highland Fairview cross-appealed from the judgment granting Petitioners'

16 claims on the five identified issues. Paulek v. Moreno Valley Community Services District (Cal. Ct.
App. 4th Dist., Div. 2. No, E071184) ("Paulek"). On May 15, 2020, the Court of Appeal issued a
17 tentative opinion reversing the Superior Court's judgment on the GHG issue and largely affirming
18

19 the Superior Court's judgment in favor of Petitioners on the other issues. Oral argument in the
appeal is scheduled for August 5, 2020.

20

21 D. The City of Moreno Valley's Subsequent Project Approval and Environmental Review

Process

22 1, The City's Revised Sections of the Final EIR

23 100. In July 2018, the City released a document entitled Revised Sections of the Final
24 Environmental Impact Report ("RSFEIR") that purported to address deficiencies identified by the
25

26 Riverside Superior Court in its analysis of impacts related to energy, biological resources and

27 habitat, noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. The RSFEIR was open for a review and public
comment period, which closed on September 7, 2018.
28

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIER

- 101.

2 Numerous members of the public, including Petitioners, submitted extensive comments to

3 the City regarding the continuing severe flaws contained in the RSFEIR's analyses. Such comments

4 expressed serious concerns about the RSFEIR's failure to adequately address the deficiencies
identified by the Riverside Superior Court.

5 102.

6 In particular, comments noted that the RSFEIR continues to inadequately address the direct

7 and cumulative impacts of the Project on biological resources and habitat, including the San Jacinto
Wildlife Area.

8 103.

9 Comments also expressed concern with the RSFIER's weakened and insufficient analysis of

10 noise impacts and mitigation and the continued failure to adequately disclose, analyze the

11 significance of, and provide adequate mitigation for the Project's significant noise impacts.
104.

12 105. Comments additionally highlighted the RSFEIR's flawed cumulative impacts analysis.

13 Comments also pointed out that the RSFEIR fails to adequately address and mitigate the

14 significant agricultural impacts related to this Project and improperly defers mitigation of

15 agricultural impacts until future plans are produced related to the development of the Project.

16 106. 2, The City's Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR

17 In December 2019, the City released a document entitled Draft Recirculated Revised

Sections of the Final Environmental

18 Impact Report ("Draft Recirculated RSFEIR"). The City found

19 the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR included significant new information requiring revision and
recirculation of portions of the.RSFEIR pursuant to Section 15088.5 of the CEQA Guidelines. The
20 sections of the RSFEIR affected by the new information in this Draft Recirculated RSFEIR were Air

21

22 Quality including Human Health, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Energy. These sections were

23 made available for a 45-day public review beginning on December 17, 2019 and ending on January
31, 2020.

24 107.

25 With respect to GHG emissions, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR stated that if the Court of

26 Appeal were to reverse the Superior Court's judgment upholding the FEIR's GHG analysis, the City

27 would require the applicant to obtain GHG "offsets" as mitigation for the Project's emissions.

28 However, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR continued to rely on the Cap and Trade Program to

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

dismiss the significance of Project emissions, and it failed to include any new mitigation measures

2 requiring the purchase of GHG offsets.

3 108. As noted by public comments and agencies, including ARB and the Natural Resources

4 Agency, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's continued reliance on the Cap and Trade Program renders

5 its analysis unlawful. Comments also pointed out that the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR apparently

6 omitted any mitigation measure that would have required the applicant to offset the Project's GHG

7 emissions in the event the Court of Appeal struck down the FEIR's reliance on the Cap and Trade

8 Program.
9 |109. Comments also pointed out that the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR failed to assess the Project's
10 consistency with local climate measures, policies, and plans. For example, reliance on GHG offsets

11 instead of VMT reductions created inconsistencies with the regional transportation plan, which the
12 Revised FEIR failed to address.

13 110. Comments also expressed serious concerns about Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's failure to

14 adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant and adverse impacts to air quality and human
15 health, including the Project's potentially severe DPM and GHG emissions impacts.

16 111. Comments also identified the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's failure to disclose transportation

17 and energy related emissions, and to meaningfully analyze requirements that would mitigate the

18 harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this project.

19 3. The City's Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the Final EIR and Draft

20 Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR

21 112. In April 2020, the City published its Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the

22 Final EIR and Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR ("Revised FEIR"). The

23 document introduced the text, for the first time, of newly proposed Mitigation Mcasure (MM)

24 4.7.7.1, a requirement that the developer purchase "offscts and/or carbon credits," the amount of

25 which would be either the "Total Uncapped" GHG emissions or "Project Emissions" from new

26 Table 4.7-16, depending on the outcome of the appeal in Paulek. The Revised FEIR asserts that

27 with the application of all previous mitigation measures and the new Mitigation Measure 4.7.7.1, the

28

25
VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

WLC Project's GHG emissions will be reduced to "net zero" and that they are, therefore, below the

2 threshold of significance.

113. Members of the public, including petitioners, again submitted comments objecting to the

4 Revised FEIR's flawed analysis of impacts from GHGs and identifying numerous flaws in
Miugation Measure 4.7.7.1.
4. The City's Approval of the Revised Final EIR and Statement of Overriding
Considerations, and its Reapproval of the Tentative Parcel Map and Development

8 Agreement

Q 114. On May 14, 2020, the City posted an Additional Errata to the Revised Final EIR, which

10 incudes, inter alia, edits to Mitigation Measure 4.4.6.3D requiring a relocation plan for burrowing

11 owls if relocation is necessary.

12 115. On May 14 and 15, 2020, the City's Planning Commission considered and adopted

13 resolutions certifying the Revised Final EIR, approving a tentative parcel map for conveyance and

14 financing purposes, and recommending approval of a development agreement for the Project.

15 116. Petitioners filed timely appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions regarding the

16 tentative parcel map and the Development Agreement to the City Council.

17 117. On June 12, 2020, the Fourth District Court of Appeal issued a published opinion,
18 invalidating GHG mitigation measure that is functionally identical in material respects to
19| Mitigation Measure 4.7.7.1. Golden Door Properties, LLC v. County of San Diego (Cal. Ct. App, 4th
20 Dist. Div. 1 June 12, 2020) Cal.App.5th 2020 WL 3119041 ["Golden Door Properties"]. The

21 Court of Appeal found that a San Diego County mitigation measure relying on offsets purchased

22 from "ARB-approved" registries violated CEQA by, among other things, failing to ensure adequate
23 standards for offscts listed by carbon registries (including offsets from international sources), and
24 improperly deferring and delegating formulation of mitigation.

25 118. The City Council heard Petitioners' appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions and

26 a held a hearing 0n1 the Development Agreement on June 16, 2020.

27 119. In preparation for the June 16, 2020 City Council hearing, the City posted, a few business

28 days before the meeting, a staff report in excess of 5,000 pages that included, among other things,

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

further revisions to MM 4.7,7.1. Those revisions removed the reference to Paulek and referred to

2 Table 4.7-16 as identifying the amount of emissions to be mitigated.

120. Following its June 16, 2020 hearing, by a 3-1-1 vote, the City Council denied Petitioners'

4 appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions, certified the Revised FBIR, and approved the
lentative parcel map. The development agreement for the Project received final approval on July 7,
2020.

7 V. THE CITY COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION OF THE REVISED FEIR AND

8 ASSOCIATED PROJECT APPROVALS VIOLATED CEQA

9 121. In May 2020, the public submitted numerous comments that included significant new

10 information about the impacts of COVID-19 on communities exposed to elevated levels of air

11 pollution. This new information necessitates a Supplemental Revised FEIR. These concerns were

12 again raised and supported by additional expert studies in a May 26, 2020 appeal letter submitted to

13 the Planning Commission.

14 122. Commenters also noted the continuous changes in the Revised FEIR's GHG analysis and the

15 lack of opportunity for the public to comment on these changes. In particular, initially MM 4.7.7.I,

16 introduced for the first time in the Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the Final EIR

17 and Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR, proposed that the Project's massive GHG

18 emissions be mitigated through "proof" of either "offsets" or "carbon credits." MM 4.7.7.1 also

19 required the City to "conclusively presume[)]" that basic criteria required under the Health and Safety

20 Code are satisfied by any offset credit purchased from "a carbon registry approved by the California

21 Air Resources Board." Yet, the amount of GHGs to be mitigated was left undetermined, depending

22 on the outcome of Paulek.

23 123. To the extent MM 4.7.7.l reflects a substitution of a "net zero" analysis for the previous

24 "capped emissions analysis," the Revised FEIR fundamentally changes how climate impacts are

25 disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated. Moreover, under any such changed analysis, environmental

26 impacts previously dismissed as less than significant would be considered significant under the

27 thresholds applied in the Revised FEIR; accordingly, the changes in the Revised FEIR reveal new

28

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

significant impacts. The City's failure to recirculate the Revised FEIR is in violation of CEQA

2 Guidelines § 15088.5.

3 124. On June 11, 2020, the City released a document that removed the reference to Paulek in the

4 mitigation measure and referred to Table 4.7-16 as identifying the amount of emissions to be
mitigated. Then, on June 16, 2020, during the City Council hearing and after all opportunities for

6 public comment had closed, Petitioners are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the

7 City again modified MM 4.7.7.1.

8 125. Although the Revised FEIR proposed a new mitigation stratcgy in the form of MM 4.7.7.1, it

9 I did not change the FEIR's underlying analysis of the significance of the Project's GHG emissions.

10 As a result, the Revised FEIR continues to rely improperly and unlawfully on the Cap and Trade

11 Program to dismiss the significance of all purportedly "covered" emissions.

12 126. The Revised FEIR must, therefore, be revised and recirculated. The EIR's approach to

13 climate impacts and mitigation now consists entirely of revisions made after the Planning

14 Commission certified the Revised FEIR, which was only three working days before the City

15 Council's hearing on an appeal of that certification. As a result, the a Revised FEIR's new approach to
16 climate change impacts and mitigation has never been circulated for public review and comment as

17 CEQA requires.

18 127. In addition, and in the alternative, the changes to the Revised FEIR rendered the EIR

19 incoherent and fundamentally inadequate as an informational document. The Revised FEIR adopted
20 an entirely different mitigation strategy without changing the EIR's underlying analysis of the

21 Project's GHG emissions, which remains unlawfully grounded in a legally and factually erroneous
22 misinterpretation of the Cap and Trade Program.

23 128. Commenters also noted that the Revised FBIR fails to mcaningfully analyze requirements

24 that would mitigate the harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this Project. For

25 example, in response to the City of Moreno Valley's April 2020 Final Environmental Impact Report,
26 the California Attorney General and the ARB jointly submitted comments pointing out that requiring

27 zero-emission trucks for the Project is feasible and is something ARB has long recommended. In

28

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

addition, commenters raised issues around the failure to include sufficient clean energy generation

2 such as solar power as a mitigation for emissions associated with this project.

3 i. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Impacts

4 129. MM 4.7.7.1 is not fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally

5 binding instruments, in violation of CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a). The measure provides no

6 standards for the City's Planning Official to use in determining whether such "offsets" are "real,
7 permanent, additional, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable" by a public agency, as required by

8 State standards. The measure also impermissibly defers and delegates mitigation in violation of

9 CEQA. Finally, the measure is inadequate and invalid under the Golden Door Properties opinion.

10 130. The public submitted comments explaining the inherent uncertainty in the success of offsets

11 and the failure of carbon credit protocols to result in one-to-one GHG reductions, ensure compliance

12 with additionality requirements, and other flaws.

13 131. Comments specifically pointed out that the offsets are not verifiable because the developer,

14 "in its sole discretion," need only submit a copy of the relevant protocol, a verification report, and a

15 copy of the serial numbers pertaining to the credits, and nothing in the measure contemplates City
16 review of the protocol for consistency with purportedly applicable standards.

17 132. Additionally, comments noted that the measure fails to provide any performance standards

18 under which the City could evaluate whether the protocol ensures credits will be consistent with

19 state standards. Contrary to the City's assertion that "net zero" is a "performance standard," "net

20 zero" is merely a generalized goal that relies too heavily on "subjective" determinations of

21 adequacy.

22 133. Comments also identified the measure's improper deferral and delegation of mitigation and
23 its lack of objective porformance standards but also bocause it addresses emissions only after they

24 have occurred.

25 134. Moreover, comments noted that MM 4.7.7.1 is not adequately enforceable. Although

26 MM 4.7.7.1 purports to require that offset credits be "enforceable," nothing in the measure provides
27 any authority for the City to hold a particular party liable and to take appropriate action if any of the
28

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

applicable regulations are violated. Additionally, the measure is not adequately enforceable because

2 nothing in MM 4.7.7.1 limits reliance on international offset projects listed by private registries.

3 135. Comments also identified the apparent limitation of the measure to 30 years, which not only

4 leaves significant Project emissions unmitigated but also jeopardizes the State's ability to meet its

5 long-term GHG emission goals.

6 136. Comments emphasized that despite the potentially significant impacts of MM 4.7.7.1, the

7 Revised FEIR fails to address these impacts in violation of CEQA Guidelines. For example,

8 although Project emissions for 2020 through 2023 would exceed the 10,000 MT COe threshold in

9 each year, and thus would be significant before mitigation, the Revised FEIR. fails to disclose and

10 analyze the significance of these impacts. In addition, the Revised FEIR failed to address forcsecablc

11 impacts of using offset credits as mitigation, an evaluation which cannot be delegated to private
12 entities.

13 137. Comments also noted that the changes in analysis and new information associated with MM

14 4.7.7.1 revealed new significant impacts and/or more severe significant impacts than were

15 previously analyzed, and that the changes rendered the Revised FEIR's analysis as a whole
16 fundamentally and basically inadequate. The City failed to recirculate the Revised FEIR in light of
17 this significant new information as CEQA requires.

18 138. Comments reiterated that the Revised FEIR illegally disregards transportation and energy
19 related emissions.

20 139. Commenters also noted the Revised FEIR fails to meaningfully analyze requirements that

21 would mitigate the harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this project, including
22 requirements for use of trucks cleaner than the current commitment of trucks meeting 2010 emission
23 standards - a standard that would allow trucks 10 years or older to enter the project in perpetuity. 24

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ii. Biological impacts

2 140. Comments expressed concern for the fact that the Revised FEIR's biological impacts section

3 remains unlawful, for example, with respect to impacts on burrowing owls and other species.

4 141. Commenters expressed that the Revised FEIR failed to provide a cumulative analysis of the

5 Project's impact on biological resources. Nearby projects, including the Village of Lakeview

6 housing development that will also impact the southern portion of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, are

7 not included in the Revised FEIR's analysis in violation of CEQA.

8 142. Commenters also expressed concerns that the Revised FEIR also claims, without providing

9 substantial evidence, 250-foot development setback is adequate protection for biological resources.

10 Numerous commenters raised negative edge effects from human activity, traffic, lighting, noise,

11 pollutants, invasive weeds, and increased fire frequency, which have been found to be biologically

12 significant up to 300 meters (~1000 feet) away from anthropogenic features in terrestrial systems.

13 These negative edge effects were not fully analyzed nor mitigated in the Revised FEIR.

14 143. Commenters also expressed concerns about truck and vehicle traffic increases on Gilman

15 Springs Road and all roads adjacent to the San Jacinto Wildlife Area for both construction and

16 operation, which will increase anticipated wildlife "roadkill." Commenters critiqued the Revised

17 FEIR's failure to provide any analysis of the increase in wildlife injury and mortality that will occur

18 due to increased traffic. By failing to adequately analyze impacts from increased traffic on wildlife

19 injury and mortality, the Revised FEIR fails to also provide avoidance, minimization, and mitigation
20 measures. Under CEQA, "the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that,
21 notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the proposed
22 project followed meaningful consideration.

23 144. Commenters also expressed concerns over the failure to have a compliant buffer between

24 buildings at the WLC site and hunting areas south of the project arca, which violates California Fish
25 and Wildlife Code requirements.

26 ili. Noise impacts

27 145. Commenters noted that the Revised FEIR significantly weakened mitigation measures

28 designed to protect the public from noise pollution.

31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P 146. Commenters noted that mitigation measure 4.12.6.2A includes options that would eliminate

2 the need to install the on-site sound barrier if a vote by those affected fails to garner 50 percent

3 favorable votes or 100 percent favorable votes för a sound barrier placed on private property. These

4 two provisions were never considered in the original noise analysis nor do they seem to be fair to the
5 community due to the speculative nature of whether a sound barrier will be used or not. In addition,

6 the developer owns properties in those locations subject to the noise impacts and is entitled to a vote

7 on sound barrier installations.

8 147. Commenters noted that this mitigation measure poses vague and unclear obligations.
9 iv. Failure as an informational document

10 148. The Revised FEIR is a complex and incoherent web, comprising two revised versions: the
11 Revised Sections of the FEIR (RSFEIR) and the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR, and additional
12 important elements added in the Response to Comments and Errata, the most recent of which

13 occurred during the final City Council hearing after the close of any further opportunity to comment.
14 Further, the Revised FEIR relies on informnation from an invalidated EIR that was struck down in its

15 entirety by the Riverside County Superior Court. The many versions and amendments to the EIR
16 have rendered the its overall analysis incomprehensible. The public and decision-makers have not

17 been provided with sufficient information to participate meaningfully in the process or proceed with
18 rational decision-making. The Revised FEIR fails as an informational document.

19 v. Failure to recirculate the Revised FEIR

20 149. Commenters identified numerous changes in the Revised FEIR and other significant new
21 information that revealed new significant impacts, substantial increases in the severity of significant
22 impacts, feasible mitigation measures and alternatives, and fundamental and basic inadequacies in
23 the document. In addition, the Planning Commission failed to translate Spanish testimony for
24 planning commissioners. The City failed to recirculate the Revised FEIR prior to certification as
25 required by Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violations of CEQA - Failure to Comply with CEQA's requirements - Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, or 1094.5; Public Resources Section 21000 et seq.)

4 150. Pctitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in

5 the foregoing paragraphs.

6 151. The City has violated CEQA by certifying : legally deficient Revised FEIR and by approving

7 the tentative parcel map and development agreement without adequate environmental review.

8 152. Among other things, the City:

9 A. Failed to adequately evaluate the Project's environmental impacts, and failed to

10 adequately respond to public comments concerning a variety of significant

11 environmental effects of the Project, including the Project's direct, indirect, and

12 cumulative impacts. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100(b), 21100(d), 21002.1, 21068,

13 21060.5, 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15126.2(a), 15130(a).)

14 For example:

15 i. The Revised FEIR fails to adequately address the Project's GHG

16 emissions. By outright dismissing the Project's significant GHG

17 emissions, which the Revised FEIR concedes will be caused by the Project

18 and which far exceed the SCAQMD's threshold levels of significance, the

19 Revised FEIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirement that it "makc a

20 good-faith effort, based to the extent possible on scientific, and factual

21 data, to describe, calculate, or estimate the amount of [GHG] emissions

22 resulting from a project." (CEQA Guidelines $ 15064.4 subsection (a).)

23 The Revised FEIR further fails to evaluate GHG emissions by failing 1o

24 consider, among others,: (1) the extent to which the project may increase

25 or reduce GHG emissions; (2) whether emissions exceed a threshold of

26 significance; and (3) the extent to which the project complies with

27 regulations or requirements adopted to implement statewide, regional, or

28 local plans to reduce GHG emissions. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b).)

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ii. The Revised FEIR fails to adequately evaluate the incremental

2 significance of the Project's increase in GHG emissions in and around the
City, throughout the County, the region and the State.

4 iit. The Revised FEIR fails to address and analyze the significance of the

5 Project's traffic, public health and air quality impacts, as well as its

6 biological resources, including loss of agricultural lands, and wildlife

7 impacts.

iv, The Revised FEIR fails to properly analyze the Project's impacts to

9 biological resources. Among numerous other flaws, the Revised FEIR

10 fails to adequately analyze the true scope of the Project's impacts to
11 wildlife, sensitive habitats and plant and animal species. The Revised

12 FEIR also fails to adequately address comments that raised serious

13 concerns regarding the Project's significant impacts to imperiled and/or

14 endangered species, such as the burrowing owl.

15 B. The City failed to re-circulate the Revised FEIR in light of significant new

16 information. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1.) Such significant new information includes,

17 but is not limited to, information about: the impacts of COVID-19 on communities

18 affected by heightened levels of air pollution; the substitution of a "net zero" analysis

19 for the previous "capped emissions analysis," which not only reflected a fundamental

20 change in how climate impacts are disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated, but also

21 revealed significant impacts not disclosed or analyzed in the EIR and rendered the
22 EIR a as a whole fundamentally and basically inadequate; the assumption, in the staff

23 report, that detention basins will provide adequate habitat for burrowing owls; and
24 information from the California Attorney General, the ARB, and Petitioners showing
25 that a requirement for electric trucks for the project is effective and feasible.

26 C. The City failed to consider, discuss, adopt, or analyze the effectiveness of adequate
27 mitigation measures to minimize the Project's significant and detrimental impacts, or

28 otherwise improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's

34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 impacts. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1(b); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15002(a)(3)

2 15021(a)(1), 15126.4.) For example:

i. The Revised FEIR fails to analyze the impacts or effectiveness of MM

4 4.7.7.1.

5 ii. The Revised FEIR unlawfully relies on MM 4.7.7.1 as mitigation.

6 MM 4.7.7.1 fails to satisfy CEQA's requirements for mitigation
7 measures because, among other things, it is insufficiently enforceable

8 and illegally defers and delegates mitigation necessary to address the

Q project's significant GHG impacts.

10 iii. The Revised FEIR also fails to adopt or analyze the effectiveness of
11 adequate mitigation measures to address the Project's significant

12 impacts to wildlife and biological resources,

13 iv. The Revised FEIR fails to include legally sound mitigation mneasures

14 for noise impacts associated with the Project.

15 V. The Revised FEIR fails to include feasible mitigation measures to

16 address significant air quality and GHG impacts, including advanced

17 clean truck technologies and enhanced solar requirements.

18 D. The City failed to base its findings, including the findings made in its Statement of

19 Overriding Considerations, on substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is defined as

20 "fact[s], [] reasonable assumption[s] predicated upon fact[s], or expert opinion

21 supported by fact [which] is not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or

22 narrative, evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous, or evidence of social Or
23 economic impacts that do not contributc to, or are not caused by, physical impacts on
24 the environment." (Pub Res. Code § 21080(e); CEQA Guidelines § 15384.) As

25 Petitioners and others noted in comments, the Revised FEIR fails to include adequate

26 support for its traffic assumptions, its GHG and other air emissions and air quality

27 assumptions, its overall impacts assessments and its statements regarding the benefits
28 of this Project. The conclusions reached in the Revised FEIR regarding the

35
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 significance of these and other impacts are not supported by substantial evidence in

2 the record. The City's CEQA findings are therefore unlawful and unsupported.

3 153. If the City and/or Does 1-20 inclusive and Real Parties in Interest, and/or Roes 21-40

4 inclusive are not enjoined from moving forward with permitting, constructing, and operating the

5 Project without an adequate Revised FEIR, and without complying with CEQA's environmental

6 review and evidentiary requirements, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no

7 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate.

8 154. By certifying the Revised FEIR and by approving a Statement of Overriding Considerations,
9 as well as by approving the tentative parcel map and Development Agreement in reliance on the

10 Revised FEIR and Statement of Overriding Considerations, the City and Does 1-20 inclusive have
11 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

12 acted without substantial evidentiary support.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

15 155. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in
16 the foregoing paragraphs.
17 156. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined, Respondents
18 and Real Parties will implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with CEQA, Petitioners
19 will suffer irreparable harm by Respondents' failure to take the required steps to protect the
20 environment and Real Partics' initiation of construction of the Project. Injunctive relief is
21 appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under
22 Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 et seq. and under Public Resources Code §
23 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:

Re: California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 Notice of Intent to File CEOA Petition Challenging the Certification of the Revised Final Environmental Impact Report for the World Logistics Center (State Clearinghouse No. 2012021045)

Dear City Clerk:
Please be advised that as required under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, the Center for Biological Diversity, Coalition for Clean Air, the Sierra Club, and the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society (collectively "Petitioners") hereby provide notice through this correspondence of their intent to file petition under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Moreno Valley ("Respondent") and HF Properties, Sunnymead Properties, Theodore Properties Partners, 13451 Theodore LLC, HL Property Partners, and Highland Fairview (*Rcal Parties in Interest"). (See Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)
Petitioners seek to challenge the Revised Final Environmental Impact Report ("Revised FEIR") for the World Logistics Center (State Clearinghouse No. 2012021045) that was heard on Juno 16. 2020 by Respondent. Petitioners will file this CEQA challenge based on the Revised FEIR's failure to comply with CEQA requirements, including but not limited to the failure to adequately disclose or accurately evaluate environmental impacts, failure to adopt all feasible mitigation
measures, adopted pursuant to improper procedures, and the failure to adequately consider cumulatively considerable impacts. For these and other reasons, the certified Revised FEIR is procedurally and substantively defective. In addition, Petitioners seek to challenge the Project approvals that flowed from the certification of the Revised FEIR, including but not limited to, the tentative parcel map, the development agreement, and other approvals.
Among other relief, Petitioners will request that the Court issue a writ of mandate 1o vacale the
Revised FEIR certification and to compel the recirculation and preparation of an environmental
impact report that conforms to CEQA requirements, in addition to vacating approvals relying
upon the Revised FEIR. Additionally, Petitioners will seek costs and attorney's fees. (See Cal. Civ. Pro. § 1021.5.)

Golden State Env. Justice Alliance v. City of Moreno Valley RIC2002675

ATTACHMENT (Number):
(This Attachment may be used with any Judicial Council form.)

In accordance with California Rules of Court ("CRC") Rule 3.300, Respondents the City of Moreno Valley and City of Moreno Valley City Council hereby give notice that the following three Petitions for Writ of Mandate are related: Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance v. City of Moreno Valley, et al., Case No. RIC2002675 (the "Golden State Action," petition attached as Exhibit A), Albert T. Paulek, Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley v. City of Moreno Valley, et al., Case No. RIC2002672 ("the Paulek Action," petition attached as Exhibit B) and Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice v. City of Moreno Valley, et al., Case No. RIC2002697 ("the CCA Action," petition attached as Exhibit C).

Background:
In April 2020, the City of Moreno Valley ("City") released a Revised Environmental Impact Report (the
"REIR") for the World Logistics Center Project ("Project"), the development of an approximately 40.6 million square feet warehouse building situated on 2610 acres located on the eastern end of the City.
In May 2020, the City's Planning Commission certified the REIR, approved a tentative parcel map for the Project, and recommended approval of a Development Agreement between the City and HF Properties, et al., ("Development Agreement") for development of the Project. The Planning Commission's decisions were appealed to the City Council.
On June 16, 2020, the City Council denied the appeals and certified the REIR for the World Logistics Center
as having complied with CEQA, approved the tentative parcel map and introduced Ordinance 967, approving the Development Agreement in reliance on the certified Revised Final EIR. On July 7, 2020, the City Council approved Ordinance No. 967, approving the Development Agreement.
Subsequently, each of the three actions identified above were filed, challenging the adequacy of the certification of the Revised Final EIR under CEQA. The Golden State Action was the first to be filed on July
16, 2020; the Paulek and CCA Actions were filed on August 17, 2020.

Basis for Actions:

Collectively, the Paulek, Golden State and CCA Actions challenge Respondent's approval of the project's tentative map, adoption of the Development Agreement, and the adequacy of the REIR and its mitigation
measures.

The Paulek Action asserts Respondents' certification of the Revised Final EIR is inadequate and violates CEQA, citing to a range of perceived deficiencies in the project description, identification and analysis of biological resource impacts, and the mitigation monitoring and reporting program. The Paulek Action further asserts a laundry list of perceived inadequacies or shortcomings in the Revised Final EIR, such as the failure to recirculate any portion of the EIR despite the availability of significant new information, failure to adequately identify, analyze and adopt feasible mitigation measures and/or a reasonable range of alternatives, and failure to adequately respond to comments submitted by the public and governmental agencies during the review period.

SHORT TITLE: CASE NUMBER:

Golden State Env. Justice Alliance v. City of Moreno Valley RIC2002675

ATTACHMENT (Number):
(This Attachment may be used with any Judicial Council form.)
The Golden State Action similarly challenges Respondents' certification of the REIR, citing to inadequacies in its analysis of environmental impacts, including cumulative impacts, to energy, air quality, and greenhouse gases, while the CCA Action asserts Respondent City certified a legally deficient REIR and approved the Tentative Map and Development Agreement without adequate environmental review.
These three actions are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court ("CRC") Rule 3.300 as each arises from the same project approvals and each requires the Court to determine the adequacy of the REIR.
Analysis:

CRC Rule 3.300, subdivision (a) provides that pending civil cases are related where (i) the cases arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact (Rule 3.300(a)(2)) and/or (ii) if it is likely for other reasons the cases will require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges (Rule 3.300(a)(4).
Though each Petition at issue here highlights different perceived weakness of REIR, the prayers for relief are substantially similar:

• The Paulek Action prays for the Court to vacate and set aside Project approvals and that all activities be suspended pending Respondent's compliance with CEQA as directed by the Court.
The Golden State Action prays for the Court to require Respondents to set aside its decision to certify the REIR and to require Respondents, in any subsequent action taken regarding the project, to adequately address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the environment, adequately consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts, and adopt a feasible environmentally superior alternative to reduce significant impacts.
prays for the Court to order Respondents to set aside its certification of the REIR The CCA Action
certification and approval of the tentative map and adoption of the development agreement and that Respondent refrain from further approvals until the City's Planning Department and City Council comply with CEQA requirements.
Clearly, these three actions arise from the same event - the City's certification of the REIR and subsequent project approvals. Given the similarities, substantial duplication of judicial resources will result if each of these three cases are heard by different judges. Further, if these three cases are not deemed related, should any one of these cases succeed and the Court vacate Respondent's certification of the REIR. and project approvals, the two other Actions would necessarily become moot.

In the interest of judicial economy, these three cases should be related for adjudication by the same Court.

In accordance with California Rules of Court ("CRC") Rule 3.300, Respondents the City of Moreno Valley and City of Moreno Valley City Council hereby give notice that the following three Petitions for Writ of Mandate are related: Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance v.

10 INTRODUCTION
11
1. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly the SoCal 12

13 Environmental Justice Alliance, ("Petitioner") challenges the World Logistics Center (*Project"),
located in the County of Riverside. The proposed Project analyzed in the REIR calls for the 14 development of an approximately 40.6 million square foot warchouse building, most of it as 15 high-cube logistics space, on 2610 acres on the eastern end of Moreno Valley. 16
2. City of Moreno Valley and City of Moreno Valley City Council ("Respondents") 17

18 certified the Revised Environmental Impact Report ("REIR") for the Project.
3. In approving the Project, the Respondents violated provisions of CEQA requiring 19 that the REIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondents 20 further violated the requirement that it analyze a rcasonable rango of alternativos, and that it 21 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondents failed to adopt all fcasible mitigation 22 for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures is uncertain 23 and is unrcasonably deferred. The level of revicw adopted by Respondents was insufficient and
24 therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the environmental consequences 25
of the Project,
26
4. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were
27 not supported by substantial ovidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

2 was improporly adopted when feasible mitigation measurcs and alternatives existed to lessen

3 significant project impacts.

13 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
14
22. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by 15 Respondents. In particular, Petitioner secks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the 16 Projoct on the grounds that Respondents has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and 17 other laws.
18
23. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources 19 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq. 20 and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
21 24. Pctitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedics requirements to maintain this
22 procecding. By way of example and without limitation, Potitioner submitted written opposition 23 to the Project during the administrative proccedings for the Project.
24 25. Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)- 25 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner. 26 26. Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA 27 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discrction because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed to 28

2 procced in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

27.
3 Petitioner has no plain, spcedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

4 law, since its members and other membors of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of

5 Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondents' approval of the Project also

6 rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordancc with those

7 laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to cxercise its discretion in

8 approving projccts under those laws, it remains under a clear, present, ministerial duty to

9 exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws,

10 Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within

11 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondents have failed and

12 refused to do so and have exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in manner that is not

13 consistent with those laws.

28.
14 Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all its

15 legal dutics as alleged in this pleading.

- FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
3 (Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
4 29. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

5 30. Under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), this complaint on the REIR
6 for the World Logistics Center project ("the Project"), State Clearinghouse Number
7
20120210451 is on behalf of the Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance (formerly the
8
SoCal Environmental Justice Alliance). The Project is to construct 40.6 million square feet of 9

10 warchouse space, most of it as high-cube logistics space, on 2610 acres of the castern end of

11 Moreno Valley. Our complaint is in two parts, first addressing flaws of the REIR, and next

12 addressing the environmental justice impacts of this Project,

ANALYSIS OF REIR
15

16 § 4.3, Air Quality

17 31. The REIR's discussion of "Regional Air Quality Improvements" is irrelevant, given the

18 situation of the local area within the South Coast Air Basin whereby the area receives a

19 significant portion of the Basin's ozone pollution. The section contains these statements:

20 "The number of days exceeding the ozone national 8-hour standard has decreased between 1992
21 and 2011. During the 1992 time period, ncarly all of the South Coast Air Basin had more than 50
22 exceedance days, with more than 100 days in nearly one-third of the Basin. This is equivalent to
23

24 more than three months during a year with ozone concentrations above the level of the standard.

25 Much of this area currently meets the national standard, including about two-thirds of Orange

26

1
27 After the City's foss to the Petitioners on five issues in the consolidated cases under Paulek v. City v. of Moreno Valley in 2018, the City originally circulated Revised Sections of the Final RIR, as if it had no obligation to recirculate a REIR, The City then
28 determined that it had to revise and recirculate portions of that document relating to Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Energy. Apparently, the City now understands that its obligation was to recirculate a revised EIR, and we will accordingly refer to the document as an RHIR.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

County and one-third of Los Angeles County, where the majority of the Basin population lives

2 and works" (CARB, 2013).

32. REIR at 4.3-2. These statements are highly misleading and out of date; the relevant
4
situation for residents is that of the Riversido-Rubidoux air quality monitoring station, where
violations of the national ozone standard have been steadily increasing: as Table 4.3-3 tells us,

7 there were 84 days excecding that standard in 2017, as opposed to 47 in 2016, 39 in 2015 and 41

8 in 2014.

9 33. As the REIR also notes, the South Coast Air Basin is in Extreme Nonattainment for the

10 federal ozone standard, and in Nonattainment for the State standard regarding PM10 and PM2.5.
11

12 We note that Table 4.3-3 discloses the number of days there were violations for various critcria

13 pollutants, and to do the REIR's health studies later in the document the REIR's consultants must

14 have calculated the additional number of days of nonattainment in the Project vicinity that would

15 be attributable to the Project, but this was not disclosed in the REIR.

16 34. At4.3-10 to -11, the REIR discusses RECLAIM as a source of additional PM2.5

17 reductions for the 2012 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). RECLAIM will not reduce
18 PM2.5 emissions attributable to the Project, and the South Coast Air Quality Management
19

20 District's ("SCAQMD's") Indirect Source Rule is unlikely to change this.

21 35. At 4.3-11, the REIR discusses 2012 AQMP mobile source implementation measures

22 including the Clean Vehicle Rebate Pilot Program for 1,000 vehicles statewide per year, and
23 funding assistance of up to 1,000 light-hcavy and medium-heavy duty trucks statewide per year

24 at up to $25,000 per vehicle. These limited programs are highly unlikely to significantly improve
25 air quality in the Project area. At buildout, the Project is expected to have 18,202 truck trips per
26 day, of which the applicant assumes (incorrectly) that 379 will be natural-gas fueled. See
27

28 RSFEIR Appendix F (Rcvised TIA, July 2018) at 93, Tablo 23 (summing truck trips at full

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

-

2 buildout). And 10,831 of those truck trips will be attributable to heavy-heavy duty trucks which

3 would not be cligible for this very limited assistance. The REIR refers also to "Accelerated

4 retirement of older light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles through funding incentives"

5 without specifying how extensive those funding incentives are, and "Further emission reductions

6 from heavy-duty vehicles serving near-dock rail yards," which does not affect this Project.

7

8 36. None of the cmission reduction measurcs at REIR 4.3-12 for off-road mobile sources

would relate to this Project.

9 37.

10 The REIR also says that the 2012 AQMP relics on the 2012-2035 RTP/SCS from SCAG.

11 This Project is not consistent with that RTP/SCS because the Project required an amendment to

12 the General Plan, and regardless of whether the amendment occurred through the initiative

13 process, the Project is not consistent with the AQMP.

14 38. The REIR also refers to the 2016 AQMP, conceding that: "The most effective way to
15 reduce air quality impacts on the health of our nearly 17 million residents, including those in
16 disproportionately impacted and environmental justice communities that are concentrated along

17

18 our transportation corridors and goods movement facilities, is to reduce emissions from mobile

19 sources, the principal contributor to our air quality challenges".

20 39. Despite this admission, the City and applicant make essentially no effort to mitigate the

21 impacts of vohicular, primarily diesel truck, pollution attributable to this Project.

22 40. Indirect Source Rule. The REIR indicates that SCAQMD's work on an "Indirect Source
23 Rule" is consistent with "Control Mcasurcs MOB 03 from the 2016 AQMP." To spell this out,
24 since the REIR doesn't, 2016 AQMP MOB 03, "Emissions Reductions at Warehouse
25

26 Distribution Centers," provides that, "The SCAQMD is currently working with industry

27 stakeholders on conducting in-use truck trip studies and obtaining emissions information from

28 various warehousc distribution types. This information along with emissions occurring in and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

around industrial warehouse distribution centers will serve as the basis for seeking opportunities

2 to reduce emissions beyond existing requiroments ... To the extent that these actions are

voluntary the emission reductions may be credited as surplus reductions (as defined by US
4
EPA) into the SIP. If emission reductions are to be included in the SIP, enforccable

6 commitments to ensure that the emissions are permanent [sic] will need to be made and may be

7 in the form of a regulation adopted by the SCAQMD within its legal authority or by other

8 enforceable mechanisms". 2016 AQMP at 4-28 to 4-29.

9 41. The REIR sets forth other information regarding the Indirect Source Rule that Petitioner
10 GSEJA did not previously have. Specifically, it indicates that the Indirect Source Rule will be
11 brought before the SCAQMD Board in the second quarter of 2020, and that voluntary measurcs
12
"could include"
13

a. A CEQA air quality mitigation fund projects could opt into to provide financial 14

2, incentives to fleet owners to buy cleaner trucks,

16 i. This should be mandatory, not voluntary, and the SCAQMD should take
17 the funds it received in its settlement over this Project for such funding so
18 2 that mitigation bencfits thosc exposed to cmissions from the Project.

b. Updated guidance for siting and operations,
20
i, Like CARB, the SCAQMD docs not have land use authority and this 21
guidance would not be followed. 22

23 C. Devclopment of necessary fueling/charging infrastructure by working with

24 utilities and regulatory agencies,

25 i. Charging infrastructure should naturally be located at the distribution
26 centers themselves, as this is where the trucks will be located, and this
27 should be the responsibility of project proponcnts, such as the applicant 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

OUA0N- for the WLC here. Further, this requirement should be mandatory, not

voluntary.

d. Development of green delivery options whereby consumers pay a voluntary
surcharge when purchasing goods online.

i. Consumers are highly unlikely to pay a voluntary surcharge in any
appreciable numbers; if funding is to come from consumers, it would have

to be a mandatory measure.

9

10 42. The REIR then recognizes that mandatory regulations arc being proposed, "since the

11 recommended voluntary measures would only result in limited emissions reductions;" this

12 approach "could provide several compliance options including":

13 a. Requirements for a voluntary fleet certification program for both construction and

14 operational flccts,

15

16 i. This measure would have to be mandatory if it was the compliance path

chosen.

17

18 b. Facility emissions caps requiring warchouses to directly control emissions,

19 i. The Air District would have to monitor emissions directly or monitor cach

20 facility.

21 c. Mitigation fecs for exceeding cap lovels,

22

23 i. This would defeat any environmental justice benefit as the emissions

24 damage would be local and the distribution of fees likcly will not be.

25 d. Crediting options for installation of charging/fueling infrastructure for cleaner

26 trucks and TRUs and conversion of cargo handling equipment to zero cmission

27 technologies.

28 i. This installation and conversion should be mandatory.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

e. Requiring facilities to utilize zero emission trucks and provide infrastructure, or

2 i. We agree this should be mandatory,
f. A points-based system.
4
43. Relevant to this Project, there should be requirements for 100% zero-emission cargo

6 handling equipment and at a minimum raceways for truck and TRU charging at each loading

7 dock.

8 44. The REIR states that, "This proposed rule would further reduce air quality emissions,

9 beyond those calculated in this analysis, as future operations of the WLC would be subject to this
10 rule once it is proposed and approved".
11
45. Sevoral things arc wrong with this. First, the REIR takes the opposite position later, that 12

13 the Indirect Source Rule would only apply to later construction (if at all). See Mitigation

14 Mcasure ("MM") 4.3.6.3E. Second, this is an REIR under CEQA, and CEQA requires analysis

15 and mitigation of significant impacts before a project is approved, and the City acknowledges

16 impacts arc significant and it must adopt all feasible mitigation moasures without waiting for this
17 Rule. Second, frankly, if SCAQMD has pursued this Rule only by interacting with "industry
18 stakcholders" rather than the affected communities, it is a captive agency and its Rulo is not
19 going to adequately mitigate for impacts as CEQA requires. 20

21 46. At 4.3-13 to -14, the REIR discusses "Diesel Regulations" such as the "Clcan Truck
22 Program" for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the CARB Drayage Truck Regulation,

23 and the CARB statcwide Truck and Bus Regulation, but the REIR docs not address what
24 specifically these programs do, and it is not clear to what degree regulations from the Ports of
25 Los Angeles and Long Beach will limit emissions at the WLC, as many trucks going to the WLC
26 will not be going to or coming from the Ports. 27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

-

2 47. At 4.3-14 the REIR says it is providing Toxic Air Contaminant ("TAC") measurements at

3 the Riverside Rubidoux station, but not for Dicsel Particulate Matter (*DPM"), even though this

4 TAC poses the greatest risk. If the REIR wanted to do its job, it would provide background

5 cancer risks from SCAQMD's MATES IV, and providing OEHHA's environmental justice data

6

7 from CalEnviroscreen?. As the Attorney General's Office recently noted in opposing this Project

8 beforc the Fourth District Court of Appeal, residents of WLC's census tract experience ozonc at

9 a rate higher than 98% of the rest of the State, and they experience cardiovascular disease at a

10 ratc higher than 95% of the State. While the MATES IV data would be out of date, because it

11 does not reflect the effects of multiple cumulative projects such as the approximately 59 other

12 warchouse projects in the region documented in the REIR's cumulative impacts section, it would

13 at least provide a start for evaluating the true magnitude of the impacts of this Project. A review

14 of the MATES IV Estimated Risk Intcractive Map available from SCAQMD's website revcals

15

16 that the background cancer risk in roughly May of 2015, based on studies that were done earlier,

was 501-800 additional

17 cancers per million people. The trial court's ruling on the petitions for

18 writ of mandate, which provided that "The FEIR should include consideration of recently

19 constructed and proposed large warchouse projects in the summary-of-projections method, and

20 should analyze whether individually insignificant impacis may be cumulatively significant,"

21 intended that further analysis be done.

22

23 48. At 4.3-17, the REIR includes Table 4.3-4, which contains perhaps the first of the REIR's
repeated assertions that "the Health Effects Institute Study clearly demonstrates that the
24 application of new emissions control technology to diesel engines has virtually eliminated the
25

26 hcalth impacts of diesel exhaust." We disagree strongly with the REIR's assertions. The HEI or

27 ACES study had several design flaws which biased it in favor of finding no health impacts.

28 2 The REIR does include a reference to MATES IV at 4.3-18, but it does not include auy of the above information, instead asserting only that "cancer risks are declining," without quantifying background risk.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

- Specifically, the study was done only on rats, not humans (unlike the over 30 studies that were

2 conducted aftor humans were exposed to diesel exhaust), the study did not use young rats which
3 would have been more susceptible to poor health outcomes, the study used a particularly hardy
4
strain of rats rather than the more susceptible strain usually used, the study failed to directly 5

6 measure how much DPM the rats were exposed to, and used mass as an indicator rather than

7 volume, and the study did not use nearly enough rats to reach proper conclusions regarding

8 health impacts to the rats it did analyze. See Shrader-Frechette, Kristin, Ph.D., "State-Variable

9 and Rcprescntativeness Errors Conccal 'Clcan Dicsel' Harm: Methodologically Fallacious
10 ACES Research," in Journal of Environment and Health Sciences (Sept. 7, 2015). This is a peer-
11 revicwed analysis. As Dr. Shrader-Frechette notes, "ACES errs because most diesel-exhaust
12

13 deaths are from DPM, and confirmed scientific consensus is that there is no safe dose of any type

14 of PM ..  Consequently, even 10 percent of a large-volume, no-safc-dose pollutant, obviously

15 can be deadly".). In fact, as she says, "NTDE-2007 engines, that have low DPM (mass)
16 emissions - appear to emit both much smaller particles and higher particle-number
17 concentrations than pre-2007 diesel engines. As a result, NTDE-2007 includes a higher
18 percentage of morc dangerous particles than typical diesel cxhaust."
19
49. At 4.3-19 the REIR addresses the supposedly over-"Conservative Nature of Health Risk
20

21 Assessments," contending that they improperly model peoplo's exposurc outside when in fact

22 residents are inside 18-20 hours a day. DPM can and does go inside and Health Risk

23 Assossments are conservative because they are mcant to model risk.

24 50. Around 4.3-21 the REIR asserts that the Traffic Impact Assessment calculates vehicle

25 milcs traveled ("VMT") with and without a "net effect," which is the assumption that
26 constructing the WLC will lead to reduced commute times. More than that, the revised TIA
27

28 projects reduced intcrim VMT because of this Project. Sec Revised 2018 TIA at 400 (Table

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

-

2 102)3. This is not credible. We are submitting herewith the declaration of Thomas Owings, a

3 former Moreno Valley mayor, to the effect that VMT is highly likely to incrcase with this Projcct

4 both in the near and long term. Air quality impacts should be modeled based on this assumption

5 and not the "net effect" assumption the REIR made.

6 51. Under heading 4.3.3.3, "Localized Construction/Operation" the REIR indicates that the

7

8 REIR assumed cach truck would idle only once per day. It is more reasonable to assume that a

9 truck will idle both when it stops and when it starts again, SO this appears to be an

underestimation of emissions again.

10

11 52. At 4.3-29 the REIR assumes mitigation conditions whereby all construction equipment is

12 Tier 4. What kind of Tier 4, Tier 4 Interim or Tier 4 Final? Regarding cither, the REIR should

13 demonstrate that the Project will have access 1o sufficient equipment in the near term if the REIR

14 is assuming that the equipment will be used.

15 53. In section 4.3.3.5 the REIR provides additional information intended to comply with
16 Sierra Club v. County of Fresno. The REIR indicates there that EPA's air quality modeling
17 guidelines recommend using a PGM, which the REIR does not define in the text.
18

19 54. In section 4.3.6.1, "AQMP Consistency," the REIR states that opcrational emissions

20 would be reduced in part through a requirement for 2010 trucks or later. There must be

21 enforcement mechanisms for this to be a credible limitation and we do not scc them, MM

22 4.3.6.3C is the provision of an "alternative fueling station" "for the motoring public," not for
23 trucks, but the REIR have apparently assumed in its air quality analysis there will be alternative-
24 fueled trucks; this is unjustified. MM 4.3.6.3E is weakly worded and allows refrigerated space on

25

26

27 3 The Revised TIA shows a net reduction in VMT from passenger cars relative to the No Project Scenario in 2025, with Freeway

28 VMT going down by 56,734 and Total VMT going down by 39,160. This is not possible because Moreno Valley already has many logistics centers and their managers report that they must employ out-of-city residents with more skills, who make long commutes to get to Moreno Valley. The TIA thus understates the amount of VMT and this undercuts the Air Quality Analysis. This complaint goes to the present air quality analysis, and GSEJA was not required to submit complaints on the TIA itself, or at any other time, for GSEJA's complaint to be considered.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

-

2 the site if a demonstration is made that there are no environmental impacts. Based on the REIR's

3 entirely improper reliance on the HEI Study wo can see the REIR trying to make that proof.

4 Refrigerated uses have not been modeled in the REIR's mitigated scenario for either the air

5 quality analysis or the health risk assessment, and they must be prohibited.

6 55. At 4.3.6.2, "Regional Construction Emissions," mitigated emissions will exceed
7 SCAQMD thresholds for everything except PM2.5 and SO2. At 4.3.6.3, the Project exceeds all

8

9 sorts of LSTs even with the mitigations the REIR lists. At 4.3.6.4, "Long Term Operational

10 Emissions," with buildout in 2020 the Project excceds all criterial pollutant emission thresholds

11 except for SOx. The City acknowledges that the applicant settled with SCAQMD for an "Air

12 Quality Improvement Fee," which we have no guarantce will go to mitigating air quality

13 conditions at or near the Project site. This is not something the Project can claim as mitigation.

14

15 56, At page 4.3-65, under "Cancer Risks," the HRA assumes the heavy-duty truck flect will
be 89 percent diesel, 9 percent gasoline, 3 percent natural gas, and 0 percent electric. The Project
16 should not be anticipating any electric truck usagc at the Project sitc without charging
17

18 capabilities at the loading docks, which the Mitigation Measures and Project Design Features do

19 not provide for. The sentenco "According to the WLC Transportation Energy Technical Report

20 (ESA 2019), a High EV Penetration scenario projects that the heavy duty truck fleet could

21 consist of 30 percent electric by 2035," is highly misleading and should be struck (although it's

22

23 already misled the REIR's local readership). It is misleading because in the REIR's Energy

24 Section, it concludes that the High EV Penctration scenario is speculative. Even the projections

25 the REIR did make are speculative, because the REIR is overestimating the number of gasoline-

26 powered trucks likcly to visit the site: The 2018 TIA calculates 18,202 truck trips per day at full

27 buildout. 3064 of these would be light-heavy-duty ("LHD") trucks, or 16.8%. To support the

28 REIR's assumption of 9% gasoline-powered, more than half of these would have to be gasoline-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

F powered. But according to the California Energy Commission ("CEC"), LHD trucks are in
2 weight classcs 3, 4, and 5, and vehicle sales in this class are about 70 percent diesel and 30
3 percent gasoline. See CEC Final Consultant Report, Forecast of Medium- and Heavy-Duty 4
Vehicle Attributos to 2030 (CEC April 2018), at 5. Multiplying 30% (for gasoline trucks) by the 5

6 percentage of LHD trucks yields about 5%, not 9%, for gasoline-powered trucks.

7 57. At 4.3-68, Table 4.3-27, "Estimated Cancer Risk for Residential Receptors without

8 Mitigation at Full Project Operation in 2035," shows a risk of 34 in a million inside the Project
9 boundaries, and 29.9 outside, except for 34 in a million along the SR 60. Inexplicably, the Table
10 claims there is no exceedance of the SCAQMD 10-in-a-million threshold along SR 60. At 4.3-
11
69, Regional Freeway Network Risk, the text at least acknowledges there is an exceedance. 12
58. At 4.3-72 the REIR identifies the following MM's to limit impacts: 13

2 59. The REIR further claims that the alternative fucling station (MM 4,3.6.3C) "may" reduco
3 emissions and "encourage alternative fueled . . . trucks on the project site." But a
4

5 feasible and entircly proper MM would be to require the inclusion of raceways with wiring for

6 truck charging extending to each loading dock so electric trucks can charge. It is frankly absurd

7 to posit a High EV Ponetration Scenario absent charging capabilitics for trücks.

8 60. We find the REIR's assertions in the Construction and Operation HRA and the

9 Operational HRA, both with mitigation, not to be crediblo. We have located an expert on HRAs
10 to comment on this aspect of the REIR but she is not available to us before the REIR's deadline.
11
We reserve the right to submit her comments once the City has issued the RFEIR.
12

13 61. We're confused by the REIR's presentation of Tables 4.3-28, Construction and Operation

14 HRA with Mitigation, 4.3-29, Sensitive Receptors Starting at Full Operation in 2035 with

15 Mitigation, and 4.3-30, Sensitive Receptors Starting at Full Operation in 2035 with Mitigation

16 and Installation of MERV-13 Filters. For one thing, 12400 World Logistics Centor Parkway is
17 not evaluated in the first two Tables, but is evaluated in the last, with the application of the
18 MERV-13 filter only, with a stated risk with the filter of 7.1 in a million4. The REIR has "cooked
19

20 the books" because a proper health risk assessment would model the impacts to the receptors at

21 that location outside of the house and unaffected by the filter (which the REIR docs not know

22 they will accept).

23 62. At 4.3-76, Figuro 4.3-6 shows an incremental project cancer risk with mitigation
24 disclosing that several receptors (two or three) along the SR 60 outside of the Project site will be
25 exposed to a risk of 10 in a million or greater. This risk is nowhere discussed in the text or in a
26 table.
27

28 4 The corresponding table in the Air Quality Report, Table 55b, footnotes *DieselNet.com, 2002." We're not sure what the reference is for, or if it is accurate.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 22

63. At 4.3-77 the REIR reiterates the assertion that "The HEI Study clearly demonstrates that
2 the application of new emissions control technology to dicsel cngines have [sic] virtually
3 eliminated the health impacts of diesel exhaust." This conclusion is unwarranted and the REIR is
4

5 misleading for reiterating it. Among other things, the HEI Study did not test cnough rats, did not

6 test the right rats, did not test the amount of DPM the rats were exposed to, and excluded young

7 rats that would be more susceptible to impacts.

8 64. At 4.3-78, the REIR states that the cancer risk reduction from ASHRAE filters is 50%.

9 This ignorcs that the filters do not trap the particles of the smallest sizcs, which carry the greatest
10 health risks. Also on this page, the REIR says the maximum cancer risk would be approximately
11
3.0 in a million at Bear Vallcy Elementary School for cither the construction and operation 12

13 scenario or the full operation scenario. This statement gives us pause because in the unmitigated

14 analyses there was mention of Ridgecrest Elementary School where the risk was greater than 10

15 in a million. Why is Ridgecrest not mentioned here? Also, the risk at Bear Valley Elementary is

16 not appreciably reduced - only from about 3.54 to 3,0 in a million, so the risk at Ridgecrest may
17 well exceed ten in a million.

18 65. Table 4.3-31 summarizes the drastic impacts of this Project, which has significant and
19

20 unavoidable impacts after mitigation regarding:

21 a. AQMP consistency

22 b. Regional construction emissions: VOC, NOx, CO, and PM10

23 c. LSTS for construction and operation; PM10

24 d. Regional long-term operational emissions: VOC, NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, with
25 regional health effects from PM10, PM2.5, and ozone.
26
e. Exposures of sensitive receptors to localized emissions of PM10 both onsite and
27
offsite.

2 66. To mitigate all these significant impacts, the City must adopt all feasible mitigation

3 measures, which would include providing clectrical hookups for truck charging at all loading

4 docks, and a significant increase in the number of solar panels planned, which we will discuss

5 further under the Energy section,

6 67. Section 4.3.6.6, "Summary of Health Risks," claims that the Project will have "minimal"

7

8 health effects relative to background numbers which the REIR provides for the entirc Southern

9 California region. We're not sure why the REIR thinks that an increase in mortality of 14.17

10 incidents per ycar, attributable to PM2.5 only, is "minimal"; cven assuming the REIR's

11 calculations are correct (which we doubt), an additional 14+ deaths per year is too many. Further,

12 between PM2.5 and ozone, there would be approximately 13 additional asthma related ER visits.

13 We're not sure why the REIR used EPA's BENMAP tool as opposed to OEHHA's

14 CalEnviroscrcen 3, which would have disclosed that the census tract has a current burden in

15 terms of cardiovascular disease exceeding 95% of the rest of the

16 State, without the Project.

17 68. The REIR does nothing to address the significant likelihood that increased incidences of

18 dementia will be attributable to the "NTDE," which is 50-90 percent metals.

19 69. At 4.3-82 the REIR cites to scveral studies that conclude there is no impact from

20 particulate matter on health. These studies are in the obvious minority and the REIR's citation to

21 them is an obvious attempt to mislead the public.

22

23

24 § 4.7, Greenhouse Gases
25

26 70. At 4.7-6 the REIR refers to federal regulations between U.S. EPA and U.S. DOT,

27 including a Phase 2 set of standards to cut carbon pollution by 2027. These standards are

28 probably not in effect.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 24

-A

2 71. At 4.7-7 to -8 the REIR refers to the Pavley regulations. The Trump Administration has

3 revoked California's waiver and we cannot count on the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions the

4 REIR posits here. This is just another reason the REIR's splitting emissions into "capped" and

5 "uncapped," and only counting the "uncapped," is unwarranted. By any rcasonable measure and

6 under Guideline 15064.4 (either version), the Project will a have a significant impact.

7

8 72. The Sustainable Freight Action Plan, E.O. B-32-15, includes a ZEV target of 100,000
trucks on the road by 2030. What is the Project doing to contribute? Without infrastructure or the
9 capacity for infrastructure, those trucks will not come.
10

11 73. At 4.7-11 the REIR describes the California Cap-and-Trade Program, saying "Fuel

12 suppliers are required to reduce GHG emissions by supplying low carbon fuels or purchasing

13 pollution permits, called 'allowances,' to cover the GHGs produced when the conventional

14 petroleum-based fuel they supply is combusted." While the Cap-and-Trade Program is meant to
15 reduce emissions from vehicles in part (we believe it is also intended to address direct emissions
16 from extraction and refining), it is morc than cloar that the Program is but one
17 step down a road

18 of many required to reduce emissions. As the Attorney General wrote in opposing the REIR's

19 "interpretation" of CEQA compliance with AB and SB 32, "Cap-and-Trade is not a program

20 designed to reduce emissions from local government actions, or land use; instead, it was

21 designed on the assumption that local actors would simultancously work to reduce emissions
22 within their spheres. Cap-and-Trade alone was designed to account for less than 40% of the total
23 cmissions reductions needed to achicve California's 2030 climate goals, and on the explicit
24 assumption that local design choices would continue to reduce overall emissions (and hence
25

26 economy-wide costs in the Cap-and-Trade Program)". Attorney Gencral Amicus Brief ("AG's

27 Amicus Brief*) (filed Jan. 10, 2020) at 20.

-

2 74. It's clear that the Legislature did not intend Cap-and-Trade to be the sole regulation of

3 California's combustion of transportation fucls, or it would not have adopted SB 375, which was

4 intended to reduce VMT within California's MPOs by changing residential land use patterns.

5 And CARB cxplicitly addressed the Sustainable Freight Action Plan as a separate strategy from

6 the Cap -and-Trade Program. See CARB's 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 1.

7

8 75. At 4.7-13, discussing the 2014 Scoping Plan Update, the REIR notes that: "Emissions of
criteria air pollutants, including ozone precursors (primarily oxides of nitrogen, or NOx) and
9 particulate matter, must be reduced by an estimated 90 percent by 2032 to comply with federal
10 air quality standards".
11

12 76. Obviously, this Project is a huge step in the wrong direction. Combined with other

13 warehouse projects in the area, it will undercut reaching this goal, as the trial court recognized in

14 requiring an improved cumulative impacts analysis which would include thosc projects (an
15 analysis the REIR did not provide, as we discuss under the relevant section).

16

17 77. The REIR falsely asserts regarding the 2017 Scoping Plan Update that "The cornerstone .

18 is an expansion of the Cap-and-Trade Program to meet the aggressive 2030 GHG emissions

19 goal and ensure achievement of the 2050 limit set forth by E.O. B30-15.33 The 2017 Scoping Plan

20 Update clarifies that Cap-and-Trade is not the "cornerstone," and the Legislature has only

21 authorized it through 2030. Sce AB 398 (2017), Section 4, amending Health & Safety Code Cp

22 38562. Continuing this discussion, the REIR tries to imply that the Cap-and-Trade Program's
23 limits are cnough to singlchandedly reduce GHG impacts from trucks and cars, but this is

24

25 directly contrary to the language in the 2017 Update which the REIR quotes at 4.7-14:

26 "Beyond plan-level goals and actions, local governments can also support climate action when

27 considering discretionary approvals and entitlements of individual projects through CEQA.

28 Absent conformity with an adequate geographically-specific GHG reduction plan as described in

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 26

-

2 the preceding section above, CARB recommends that projects incorporate design features and

3 GHG reduction measures, to the degree feasible, to minimize GHG emissions. Achieving no net

4 additional increase in GHIG emissions. resulting in no contribution to GHIG impacts, is an

5 appropriate overall obiective for new development (CARB, 2017c)". REIR at 4.7-14 (emphasis

6 in original, underlining supplied).

7

8 78. Moreno Valley docs not have an "adequate gcographically-specific GHG reduction plan

9 as described in the preceding ection" of the 2017 Scoping Plan Update, andthe REIR does not

10 demonstrate that this Project will achicve "no net additional increase in GHG emissions . . .

11 [from] new development."

12 79. This is apparent from the 2017 Scoping Plan Update's "preceding section," which the

13 REIR fails to quote, so we will do that here. Under "Climate Action through Local Planning and

14

15 Permitting," and "Recommended Local Plan-Level Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Goals,"
the 2017 Scoping Plan states: "Local government efforts to reduce emissions within their
16 jurisdiction are critical to achieving the State's long-term GHG goals, and can also provide

17

18 important co-benefits, such as improved air quality ... [1l CARB recommends statewide targets

19 of no more than six metric tons CO2c per capita by 2030 and no more than two metric tons

20 CO2e per capita by 2050. The statewide per capita targets account for all emissions sectors in the

21 statc, statcwide population forecasts, and the statewide reductions nocessary [under SB 32 for
22 2030 and E.O. S-3-05 for 2050]. [9] Numerous local governments in California have already
23 adopted GHG cmissions reductions goals for ycar 2020 consistent with AB 32. CARB advises

24

25 that local governments also develop community-wide GHG emissions reduction goals necessary

26 to reach the 2030 and 2050 climate goals [and that they be based on mass cmissions, per capita

27 emissions, and service population emissions]. . . .  1l Contributions from policies and programs,

targets, but longer-term targets cannot be achieved without land use decisions that allow more
2 efficient use and management of land and infrastructure. Local governments have primary
3 authority [in this realm]. Land use decisions affect GHG emissions associated with
4

5 transportation, water use, wastewater treatment, waste generation and treatment, energy

6 consumption, and conversion of natural and working lands. Land use decisions play a

7 particularly critical rolc in reducing GHG cmissions associated with the transportation sector,

8 both at the project level, and in long-term plans .. . While the State can do more to accelerate

9 and incentivize thesc local decisions, local actions that reducc VMT are also necessary to mcet
10 transportation sector-specific goals and achieve the 2030 target under SB 32. Through
11

12 developing the Scoping Plan, CARB staff is more convinced than ever that, in addition to

13 achieving GHG reductions from cleaner fuels and vehicles, California must also reduce VMT".

14 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 99-101 (emphasis supplied).

15 80. This Project does not reduce VMT from trucks, or cars (see Owings Declaration), in mid-
16 range or long-range timeframes. Further, the 2017 Update statcs there is a gap between the VMT
17 reductions to be delivered by SB 375 (which, by the way, have not materialized), and what is
18 nceded to meet the 2030 and 2050 goals, and that besides planning that reduces VMT, local
19

20 governments must "increas[e] low carbon mobility choices." 2017 Scoping Plan Update at 101.

21 Here, "increasing low carbon mobility choices" means providing for electric truck infrastructurc

22 at loading docks (as well as including enough solar power and batteries to supply those trucks
23 with power).

24 81. At 4.7-14, under "4.7.2.3 Regional Regulations," the City asserts that: "The RTP/SCS
25 exceeds its grecnhouse gas emission-reduction targets set by the CARB by achicving an 8
26 percent reduction by 2020, an 18 percent reduction by 2035, and a 21 percent reduction by 2040
27

28 compared to the 2005 level on a per capita basis". (emphasis supplied).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 28

1 82. As we just noted, CARB has stated that SB 375 reductions in VMT are not enough, and:
2 an 18 percent reduction by 2035 from 2005 levels is obviously not the samç as 40 percent
3 reduction by 2030 from 1990 levels, and a 21 percent reduction by 2040 from 2005 levels is not
4

5 nearly enough to achieve an 80 percent reduction by 2050 from the transportation sector as

6 mandated by E.O.'s S-3-05 and B-16-2012.55.

7 83, The REIR notcs that the 2016-2040 RTP/SCS has an Appendix on Goods Movement, but

8 it fails to include the facts that the Appendix provides for "Full Deployment of All Commercially

9 Viable Truck and Rail Tochnologies" between 2020 and 2040, and "Deployment of Existing
10 Near-Zero Emissions Truck Technologies" and "Continue[d] Evaluation of Zero-Emission Truck
11
Technologies in Operational Service" with an enddate of 2025. Sce 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Goods
12

13 Movement Appendix at 49. As this Project will not complete Phase 1 until 2025, it should

14 support zero-emission trucks by providing clectric charging infrastructure at loading docks.

15 84. At 4.7-15 the REIR commences its discussion of the City of Moreno Valley "Climate
16 Action Strategy," stating that it outlines how the City can reduce its organizational consumption
17 of energy and water and outlining "actions that the City can encourage and community members
18 can employ." The City of Morcno Valley's Climate Action Strategy, which has an end-date of
19

20 2020, does not even comply with CARB's requirements for a 2020 climate action plan, because

21 it never identified hard targets for reduction per capita or por service population. And it is

22 blatantly inadequate to limit emissions beyond 2020, which is the timeframe for the Project to
23 commence even very limited operations. Finally, while the REIR purports to demonstrate the

24

25

26

27 5 It is also too late to argue that the 2050 goals included in these Executive Orders are not mandated by science and applicable to this Project. See Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts ("SANDAG") (2017) 3 Cal. 5th 497, 515 (finding that Executive Order S-3-05's *2050 goal of reducing California's greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels
28 expresses the pace and magnitude of reduction efforts that the scientific community believes necessary to stabilize the climate," and that it therefore had to be discussed in the SANDAG EIR: "This scientific information has important value to policymakers and citizens in considering the emission impacts of a project like SANDAG's").
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 29

2 Project's compliance with the Climate Action Strategy at 4.7-45 through -46, it fails to

D c0 740A 00 demonstratc compliance:

a. Strategy R3-E1 is described as "Energy Efficient Development, and Renewable
Encrgy Deployment Facilitation and Streamlining: Updating of codes and zoning
requirements and guidelines to further implement green building practices. This
could include incentives for energy efficient projects." While the REIR claims
this Strategy is "Not Applicable," the Strategy directly calls into question the

10 apparent policy of the Morcno Valley Utility ("MVU") to limit PV installations to

11 "one-half the minimum electricity demand a building experiences during daytime

12 hours." The City, which owns the MVU, should clearly waive this limitation,

13 which massively undercuts the Project's ability to achieve net-zero energy

14

15 ("NZE") and provide electric power for trucks (indeed, in the Encrgy section, the

16 REIR refuses to consider the High EV Penetration Scenario based on the

17 increased need for load for the buildings, and states that the MVU won't consider
it either),
18

19 b. Strategy R3-L2 is described as "Hcat Island Plan. Develop measures that address

20 "heat islands.' Potential measures include using strategically placed shade trees,

21 using paving materials with a Solar Reflective Index of at lcast 29, an open grid

22

23 pavement system, or covered parking." The REIR asserts the Project is

24 "Consistent" because the Specific Plan calls for landscaping providing "50

25 percent coverage at maturity." The Specific Plan will not be fully operational until

26 2035, when the carth's climate is likely to be in significantly worse shape than it

27 is now, and the "shade canopy" is unlikely to grow in until about 2050 (at the

28 carliest). Therefore the Project should be "using paving materials with a Solar a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 30

Reflective Index of at least 29, an open grid pavement system, or covered

2 parking," none of which are considered.
3 85. The City's description of the Climate Action Strategy in the REIR is also not at all
4
comprchensive. Besides the policies discussed in the REIR, the Climate Action Strategy includes

6 these goals:

7 a. "C41. Set goals consistent with State's Long Term Strategic Plan: . . . All new

commercial construction in California will be zero net energy by 2030." The

9 Project docs not comply, only requiring the buildings to be approximately NZE
10 = ~ for office uses, not, for example, lighting for the buildings as a whole, or
powering clectric trucks.

13 b. "C 42. Encourage installation of solar and wind power systems and solar hot

14 water hcaters," and "C 46. Adopt and implement a policy to increase the use of

15 renewable energy," are not complied with here because the MVU's policy of

16 limiting PV installation to "onc-half the minimum clectricity demand a building

17 experiences during daytime hours" is not supportive of the stated renewable
18 cnergy goals (and is likoly illegal, given the State's NZE goals for commercial
19 buildings by 2030, if not otherwise). See 2012 Moreno Valley Climate Action
20

21 Strategy at 286.

22 86. At 4.7-18 the City acknowledges that the Project would have GHG impacts if it

23 "Generato[s] [GHG] cmissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact a

24 on the environment (i.e., exceeds the SCAQMD's 10,000 mt CO2e emissions screening

2 MTCO2e for its own projects as an appropriate measure, but the method the City engages in to

3 calculatc emissions from the Project, which excludes the usc of transportation fuels and encrgy

4 sources and most construction emissions from analysis because they are supposedly "capped" by

5 the Cap-and-Trade Program, is cntircly inappropriate, as discussed extensively above. In the

6 mitigated scenario, the supposedly "capped" emissions represent about 96% of Project emissions

7

8 and they count toward the Project's GHG impacts. As the AG's Office writes, "The CEQA
Guidelines allow projects to consider regulations "[with] which the project complies" for
9 purposes of considering significance of GHG emissions. (Sce CEQA Guidelines, § 15064.4,
10

11 subd. (b)(3).) However, that consideration does not apply here and Respondents' approach,

12 which in effect relics on other entitics to undertake Respondents' CEQA mitigation, not only

13 violates both CEQA's legal requirements and public disclosure and mitigation purposes, but also

14

15 undermines the state climate objectives Cap-and-Trade is intended to further". AG's Amicus

Brief at 15.

16

17 87. The REIR writes at 4.7-18 that: "Some policymakers and regulators suggest that a zcro

18 emissions threshold would be appropriate when evaluating GHGs and their potential effect on

19 climato change. Such a rule appears inconsistont with the State's approach to mitigation of

20 climate change impacts. AB 32 and SB 32 do not prohibit all new GHG emissions; rather, they

21 require a reduction in statewide emissions to a given level".

22

23 88. The REIR's rejection of CARB's approach in the 2017 Scoping Plan Update (which it
declincs to quote, contravening CEQA's requirements for a good faith effort at full disclosurc) is a
24 fundamentally flawed. As is evident from the extensive quotation from the 2017 Scoping Plan
25

26 Update above, what CARB (the preeminent agency on compliance with California's climate

27 action goals) said was first, that local agencies needed to develop individual and enforceable

28 climato action plans ("CAPs") containing measured maximum per capita limits of 6.0 MTCO2c

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 32

F for 2030 and 2.0 MTCO2e for 2050, such that individual projects demonstrating compliance

2 with those CAPs would be permissible, and second, regarding those projects not covered by a
3 CAP, they should be net zero. In this regard, CARB clearly was indicating that CAPs represent
4
the caps on emissions from local land usc, not that the Cap-and-Trade Program provided such 5

6 limits. The REIR's analysis is incomplete and incorrect.

7 89. At 4.7-19 the REIR relies on two unspecified negative declarations by SCAQMD where

8 it concluded that capped emissions do not count toward the 10,000 MTCO2e threshold. These
caps. And the policy of an 9 probably werc refinery projocts directly subject to the Cap-and-Trade
10 agency without jurisdiction, the San Joaquin Valley APCD, is entirely irrelevant and inadequate
11 precedent, given CARB's clear authority and its contrary pronouncements on the subject.
12

13 90. The REIR relies on MM 4.7.6.1D to install solar panels generating 24,083 MWh per

14 year, which it concedcs is only 5 porcent of the Projoct's electricity demand at buildout. This is

15 far less than the generating capacity of the Project, which we estimate to be about 1.46 million

16 MWh per year, in fact it is only about 1.7% of what the Project site could achieve using rooftops

17 alone. Based on the Project's estimated power usage, if 27,083 MWh is per year is 5%, then the
18 Project could power its full usage with 115 squarc fect of solar panels. To the extent this
19 development would require a waiver from the MVU, the Project must get one.
20

21 91. At 4.7-37 to -40, the REIR makes the wholly unjustified assumption that 21% of

22 passenger vehicles and 22.5 % of light trucks would be electric by 2035. The assumption
23 regarding light trucks is unjustified unless they have a place to charge, and the Project is not
24 giving them that.
25 92, The REIR claims that the Project follows the Sustainable Freight Action Plan, though the
26 Project would hinder achievement of its goals. At 4.7-43 to -44, the REIR asserts that the Project
27

28 follows the 2017 Scoping Plan Updato. It is not, as discussed above. The REIR crroncously

We quoted above.

5 § 4.17, Energy

6 93. The REIR says the project will be designed to eliminate the need for natural gas in

7

8 building systems, positioning the WLC to become an all-electric development with potential to

9 operate on 100% renewable energy. As noted immediately above, the Project could do this now

with 115 square
10 feet of solar panels, depending upon its demand. If the MVU tries to limit the

11 power the facility can glean from solar, it may be contrary to state law (particularly since the

12 MVU has not met the RPS standards, which are also increasing rapidly).

13 94. At 4.17-14, the REIR discloses that CNG/LNG fuel use assumed, per the traffic study,

14

15 that all visits to the alternative fueling station were from trucks, This is contrary to the wording

of the MM.

16 95, At 4.7-15, the conclusion reached is that solar

17 power without battcry storage is the best

18 renewable energy technology, generating at a level that solely supplies the office uses with

19 power. Then it states additionally that "tho project proponent is committed to requiring on-site

20 rooftop solar generating capacity up to the maximum level currently permitted by the MVU,

21 which is defined as one-half the minimum electric demand a building experiences during

22

23 daytime hours." MM 4.7.6.1D does include installing solar panels up to the limit permitted by
the MVU; MVU's limit is too low, however, as is evidenced by its apparent unwillingness to
24 handle the High EV Penetration Scenario. That Scenario is likely a necessary component 1o this
25

26 Project meeting SB 32 requirements under CEQA,

27 96. Under "Technology Advancement," the REIR concedes that the California Public

28 Utilitics Commission ("PUC") has goal for all commercial construction to be ZNE by 2030.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 34

Yet the REIR merely states that, "By proactively embracing an all-electric building design and

2 committing to solar-ready roof construction, WLC would be net-zero ready and in a stronger
3 position for compliance with future Title 24 updates." This seems to ignore that buildings
4
constructed after 2030 should have to comply with ZNE requircments. 5

6 97. Under both Scenario A, Low EV Penetration, and Scenario B, Medium EV Penetration,

7 the REIR states that DC power blocks "would charge thousands of vehicles per day," but no
8 mitigation measure requires the installation of DC power blocks, SO this speculation is

9 unwarranted.

10 98. Regarding Scenario C, High EV Penetration, 20 percent of heavy duty trucks would be
11 EVs, and 10 percent of medium duty trucks would be EVs, by 2025, and 30 percent of heavy
12

13 duty trucks, and 20 percent of medium duty trucks, would be EVs by 2035. Despite relying on

14 these percentages (or higher percentages) elsewhere in the document, the REIR concludes that

15 the High EV Penetration Scenario is unwarranted.

16 99. The REIR agrees that one throshold of significance requires consideration of "The
17 project's projected transportation energy use requirements and its overall efficient use of
18 efficient transportation alternatives," citing CEQA Guidelines Appendix F, Section II C6. For
19
this Project, that means analyzing and providing alternative energy for electrified trucks.
20

21 100. At 4.17-22 regarding On-Site Renewable Encrgy, the REIR says, "The WLC Specific

22 Plan commits the WLC project to meeting the annual energy requirements of all office spaces

23 with PV, thereby effectively achicving net-zcro energy (NZE) office operations". (emphasis
24 supplied.)
25 101. NZE office operations are not sufficient; the buildings should be NZE for full operation
26 (including truck charging).
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 35

102. Regarding battery storage, the REIR says that "MVU currently has no policies or rules
2 that would allow WLC to use battery storage.' It docs not necessarily havc any policies or rules
3 prohibiting such use, and therefore battery storage should be permitted.
4

5 103. The closest the REIR comes to committing to charging for trucks is at 4.17-23 to -24

6 where it states: "Although it is speculative to state what the regional fleet mix will be as each

7 phase of the projcct is completed, and the adoption of ZEVs by WLC employces and customers

8 will be beyond the direct control of the WLC, all EV types should be anticipated in planning for
9 the onsite charging infrastructure. To that end, the project will construct the WLC parking arcas
10 with cable raceways for installing future EV charging stations, which will enable WLC to more
11 readily and cost effectively provide this service to future tenants if and when demand dictates".
12

13 104. We don't see that as an enforceable commitment in any mitigation measure. It should be,

14 and raceways should go to all the loading docks.

15 105. As an apparent excuse for not providing raceway to the loading docks, the REIR

16 consultants write: "many warehouses implement the "drop and drag" procedure, where a truck
17 will bring goods to the facility, and the trailer (or sea-going container) will be disconnected and
18 left on-site for the lengthy process of unloading. An empty trailer may be connected and the
19

20 truck quickly departs to return to its point of origin. Conversely, an out-bound truck is usually

21 scheduled to retrieve a delivery load only once the container/trailor is full", REIR at 4.17-30.

22 106. Obviously, if trucks are electric, as they must be soon, scheduling will change
23 becausc by far the most convenient location for trucks to charge is at the loading docks.

24 107. Next, the REIR provides its ultimate excuse for not providing raceways: "Medium-duty
25 and heavy-duty zero emission trucks are in the very carly stages of commercially market
26 deployment [sic] and currently cost substantially more than conventionally fueled trucks, and
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 36

current funding assistance programs do not fully offset that cost difference (ESA and

2 CALSTART, 2018)".
3 108. New technologies always cost more in their infancy, and then come down in price. This
4

5 is simply no excuse for not preparing WLC for the inevitable future.

6 109. Then the REIR argues that the High EV Penetration Scenario is "highly speculative"

7 relative to electric demand. False. Climato change is a major threat in California, and the region's

8 criteria air pollutant exceedances must be addressed. Transition to electric trucks is needed for

9 both reasons.

10 110. Regarding the REIR's projections for MVU's capacity, since the City's consultants and
11

12 MVU scom to belicve MVU can't power the WLC under the High EV Penctration Scenario, the

13 MVU should not limit the solar capacity of the site in the way that it apparently is. This should

14 be obvious. As noted above, the buildings have the capacity to generate at least 1.46 million

15 MWh of solar power. Further, the projections the REIR makes for the buildings' minimum
16 daytime use should include the powcr nceded for the trucks under the High EV Penetration

17 Scenario. The WLC should provide solar panels to power the trucks in particular because the
18 REIR discloses that "the WLC project's cstimated electrical consumption would account for
19

20 between 74 and 113 percent of MVU's projected electricity projected [sic] sales, depending on

21 the EV penctration scenario for Phase 1 (2025)." If the WLC alone constitutes 113% of projected

22 sales, the MVU will have to expand its portfolio massively, while keeping in line with the

23 Renewablo Portfolio Standard (something it apparently is not doing currently). This impact must

24 be ranked as significant, because as the REIR acknowledges, the thresholds of significance
25 require that the City and Project proponent evaluatc "The effects of the project on local and
26 regional energy supplies and on requirements for additional capacity ([CEQA Guidelines]
27

28 11 Appendix F Section II C-2)," as a factor, and the separate criterion that "A project would result

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 37

in significant impacts with regard to energy use and consumption if it would require the

2 construction of new electrical facilities or cxpansion of existing facilitics, the construction of
3 which would cause significant environmental effects." REIR at 4.17-18 to 4.17-19.
4

5 111. Standalone solar facilitics in California's desert, perhaps the primary source of rencwable

6 power which utilities have been relying upon, have significant environmental impacts on desert

7 wildlifc, including but not limited to profound impacts on avian populations using the Pacific
8 Flyway, the desert tortoise, and the burrowing owl. The City must remember that the mortality

9 threshold for sensitive, threatened or endangered avian specics is the "one bird" take threshold
10 set forth in the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
11 See 16 U.S.C. § 703, 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(B) and Cal, Fish & Game Code $ 86. Under this
12

13 threshold under CEQA, the death of even one special-status bird, or a desert tortoise, is a

14 significant impact if no take permit has been obtained (and GSEJA is not aware of any take
15 permits being issued to any solar facilities in the desert). See Pub. Res. Code 21002.1(c).
16 USFWS documented the deaths of at least two foderally-endangered Yuma Clapper Rails at solar
17 projects in the desert in May of 2013 and April of 2014, as its comments on one Project, the Palo
18 Verde Mosa Solar Project, indicate. In sum, the WLC project would causo significant impacts
19 because it will require the construction or expansion of new electrical facilities which would
20

21 have significant impacts themselves.

22 112. Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines requires that the City and Project sponsor calculate
23 "The effects of the projcct on peak and base period demands for clectricity . . . (Appendix F
24 Section II C-3)." REIR at 4.17-19. The REIR notes that based on MVU's forecasts, peak demand

25 for its power grid will be 83,4 MW in 2025. Under the High EV Penetration Scenario, 2025 peak
26 demand from the Project alone would be 54.4 MW. The REIR seeks to give readers a false sense
27

28 of security, stating that: "MVU's 2018 IRP anticipates growth in the region and specifically

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 38

1 considers the electrical demand generated by energy-intensive account [sic] focused in the

2 logistics industry. The IRP states that largo energy intensive projccts like the WLC projcct are
3 included in the projected growth". REIR at 4.17-30.
4

5 113, It is clear, however, from what the REIR says that MVU has not projected for the WLC,

6 because the WLC alone would account for 113 percent of MVU's projected sales in 20257.

7 114. Another reason this Project would lead to the "wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary"

8 consumption of energy is that the MVU apparently does not presently comply with the state's

9 RPS. Specifically, tho REIR acknowledges that MVU only had renewable power sources
10 accounting for 17% of its "overall energy mix" in 2017, REIR at 4.17- 31, but under SB 1078
11 (2002), MVU had to have 20% in its renewables portfolio by that ycar, Because SB 350 requires 12

13 33% renewables generation by the end of 2020, MVU must double its renewables generation

14 between 2017 and the beginning of 2021. Further, the MVU 2018 Integrated Resource Plan (July
15 2018) (*MVU IRP"), which we presume will be part of the administrative record since the REIR
16 cites it, is out of date because under SB 100 (Sept. 10, 2018), the following procurement

17 requirements apply, including to local publicly owned electric utilities:
18
a. 44% by 12/31/24
19
b. 50% by 12/31/26
20

21 C. 52% by 12/31/27

22 d. 60% by 12/31/30

23

24
7 See also the contradictory discussion at REIR 4.17-35: Although the project would result in moderate increases in 25 annual electrical demand from EV charging compared to MVU's current supply (for the low and medium EV penetration scenarios), MVU is committed to meeting the project's electricity demand through a future IRP update and planning process. As 26 mentioned above, MVU's IRP addresses the fact that the project would exceed the utillity's current and forecasted demand. However, the IRP states that energy-intensive logistics projects are considered in the projected growth. Any determination on 27 additional capacity would be speculative considering MVU is aware of the project and its effect on grid electricity, MVU has a considerable amount of time to procure energy resources in anticipation of the project's development.
28 MVU's IRP does not address WLC's exccedance of its current and forecasted demand. MVU does not have a "considerable amount of time" to procure further energy, particularly considering RPS demands. And projection of additional capacity is not speculative, in fact, Appendix F requires il.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 39

115. Thus, MVU must nearly triple its renewables generation by the end of 2026. Despite

2 these requirements, MVU has indicated that it disfavors local renewable resource development
3
on customer sites because it claims that utility-scale projects in the desert are cheaper. See MVU
4

5 IRP at 4-11. Howcver, (1) utility-scale projects arc having significant impacts, and (2) MVU's

6 policy of limiting solar development on customer sites is unreasonable, given its own failure to

7 comply with the RPS.

8 116. The REIR states that, "at full buildout WLC will feature the equivalent of twenty-seven

9 60,000 square-foot net-zero office buildings. To put this in context, the entire State of California
10 has about 190 net-zero commercial buildings that are currently verified or designed as of 2017
11 (CPUC, 2017). REIR at 4.17-31,
12

13 117. This is highly misleading, as the WLC buildings will each be about 1,500,000 square

14 fect, and the buildings will not be N'ZE with respect even to demand for lighting or cooling,

15 much less with respect to their ability to power trucks or cars,

16 118. It appears MVU is complicit in the WLC's desire to endanger the health of the residents

17 of Moreno Valley and the safety of the planet, because the REIR says, "Although the project
18 would result in moderate increases in annual clectrical demand compared to MVU's current
19

20 supply, for the low and medium EV penetration scenarios, MVU is committed to meeting the

21 project's electricity demand through a future IRP update and planning process". REIR at 4.17-

22 31.

23 119. If MVU has no such commitment regarding the High EV Penctration Scenario, the City
24 (which owns MVU) is single-handedly imperiling its residents and the planet.
25 120. The Project proposes a CNG/LNG fueling station, which the REIR says in combination
26 with large trucks, yard trucks and forklifts will consume 821,523 MMBtu/year. The REIR
27

28 comparcs this to statewide natural gas consumption in 2018 for some reason. The Project's.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 40

- commitment to a CNG/LNG fueling station and yard trucks and forklifts running on CNG/LNG

2 represents a cumulatively considerable impact regarding GHGs, and is wasteful. Instcad, the
3 proposed station should provide additional DC fast-charging capability, and the REIR should
4

5 have mitigation measures (1) requiring DC fastcharging (rather than Level Two) charging at

6 sites, and (2) requiring electric forklifts and yard trucks.

7 121. The REIR's analysis is based on the assumptions of the Revised Traffic Study, which

8 anticipated 204 trucks completely refueling at the CNG/LNG station per day. However, the MM
9 anticipates no truck use of the station, and the station should provide electric charging.
10 122. Regarding fuel efficiency, the REIR states that the Project would benefit from
11

12 California's Pavley standards, which are "the most stringent in the nation and among the most

13 stringent in the world." The Pavley/ACC standards are not enforceable, given U.S.

14 EPA's denial of California's Clean Air Act waiver. This information should have been

15 included in the REIR, which came out in December 2019, long after California sued the EPA in

16 September.

17 123. At 4.17-37 to -38, the REIR purports to discuss whether the Project will require the
18 construction or expansion of new clectrical facilitics which could have significant cnvironmental
19

20 effects. We have addressed this question above. The REIR fails to discuss the need for additional

21 utility-scalc generation within this section.

22 124. At 4.17-39 to -40, the REIR addresses the threshold of the degree to which the Project

23 complics with existing cnergy standards, but it docs not discuss the pending Title 24 requirement

24 that all commercial buildings be ZNE by 2030. See CPUC, California Energy Efficiency
25 Stratcgic Plan Update, 2011 at 30-33. Failure to comply with this requirement means the Project
26 "would conflict with or obstruct a state. plan for renewable energy or energy efficiency. REIR
27
at 4.17-19.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 41

2 § 6.3, Cumulative Air Quality Impacts
3 125. Consistently throughout this analysis the REIR refers to 67 projects out of 359 that have
4

5 been completed or begun construction and concludes that therefore there arc 289 potentially

6 cumulative projects. These numbers do not add up.

7 126. There is no rcal analysis of cumulative impacts in this section except regarding the HRA;

8 the REIR merely concludes that cumulative impacts will be significant based on Project impacts

9 being significant. The REIR also proposes no further mitigations for cumulative impacts, which
10 it must, because they were found to be significant.
11

12 127. Regarding the cumulative HRA, the REIR does not provide a significant amount of data,

13 however, it appears from the discussion at 6.3-32 that the consultants modeled dispersion of

14 DPM over a 3,500 square mile arca even though the cumulative projects cover an arca that
15 appears to be considerably smaller than 1024 square miles (see Figure 6.3-1). Nevertheless, the

16 HRA comes out with significant cumulative impacts in terms of incremental cancer risk and
17 cancer burden, REIR at 6.3-48 to -49. We suspect this analysis significantly underestimates
18 cumulative impacts in terms of health risk, but again, the REIR proposes no additional mitigation 19
measures, although it is required to.

128. This section is unacceptable for the same reasons section 4.7 is unacceptable, that is, it

2 excludes all analysis of supposedly "capped" emissions. The Attorney Gencral's Office has
3 opposed the REIR's shoddy analysis as violating CEQA Guidelines section 15064.4.
4

5

6 § 6.17, Cumulative Energy Impacts

7 129. The REIR does not consider the proper cumulative energy impacts of warchouse projects

8 relative to the solar they can produce, anymore than it does regarding the Project.

9 130. The REIR improperly claims that the MVU has projected for the additional planned
10 logistics centers when it apparently has not.
11

12

13 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS

14 131. As noted in the attached Declaration of Thomas Owings, this Project is highly unlikcly to

15 employ any significant number of Moreno Valley residents; as he states, the Skechers facility

16 only employed 35 out of its 600 workers from the City according to its General Manager. This

17 not only means that the Project's air quality impacts are severely underestimated, it also has
18 significant environmental justice implications, because the additional burdens on the health of
19 Moreno Valley and surrounding communities' residents will not be offset by new economic
20

21 opportunities.

22 132. As we pointed out previously, warehousing and logistics jobs pay less than a living wage,

23 regardless of whether the employees arc tcmporary (51% arc tomporary, according to a 2015

24 UCLA study) or permanent, because the annual income these jobs generate in either event puts

25 them under the federal poverty line for a family of three. So even if local residents were hired,
26 the income generated would hardly set off the worsened health outcomes for the community.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 43

Studies show that most of these workers won't get health insurance, and even if they do, they

2 it may not get it for their families.
3 133. As we stated in our comment letter, the site of the WLC is one of very few remaining
4

5 non-logistics or industrial uses within the City. The REIR should have evaluated the impacts to

6 the City of the lost opportunity for its residents to be in a more livable environment.

7 134. As the Attorncy General's Office noted in its Amicus Brief relating to this Project, the

8 Project will be built in a census tract in the 75th to 80th percentile of census tracts in California

9 in terms of the greatest pollution burden indicators and health and vulnerability factors according
10 to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA") CalEnviroScreen 3.0
11 tool. Even without the Project, the census tract already has ozone at a rate higher than 98% a of the
12

13 rest of California, and they have cardiovascular disease at a rate higher than 95% of the state,

14 which is likely attributable to their air pollution burden. The census tract has low birthweight

15 babies at a rate greater than 82% of the state8. With its significant GHG impacts, the Project will

16 only make these things worse. The City needs to consider these issucs in connection with

17 amendments to its General Plan addressing environmental justice, and it should do so now.
18 135. A rocent report from Jones Lange LaSalle IP, Inc. discusses the state of the logistics
19
industry in Southern California: The low unemployment rates in the Inland Empire reflect that
20

21 the Project will need to find workers who take long commutes, and that Moreno Vallcy's

22 residents will not benefit from the Project. Further, the increased demand for IE warehouse space

23 projects further significant impacts in this alrcady pollution-burdened arca, in terms of further
24 criteria pollutants, TACs, and GHGs.
25 136. Government Code section 11135(a) requires local agencies to consider environmental
26 justice impacts on their residents, and section 11136 requires administrative hearings by the state
27

28 8 In the City as a whole, over half the census tracts score above the 6 1st percentile for asthma, and only four of the City's census tracts are below the 92.89th percentile for PM2.5.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 44

F to decide whether a violation has occurred. Funding to the local agency may be curtailed by the
2 state because of a violation, and section 11135 may be enforced via a civil action for equitable
3 relief. Gov. Code §8 11137, 11139. Further, under CEQA, the City must "[t]ake all action
4
nccessary to provide the pcoplo of this state with clean air and water, enjoyment of aesthetic, 5

6 natural, scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise." Pub.

7 Ros. Code § 21001(b). We urge the City to take its responsibilities seriously this time.

8 137. Finally, if this Project goes forward in severely modified form in the future, the City inust
9 mitigate its impacts by providing better cducation for its students, so they can obtain the jobs the
10 Project will offer.
11 138. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's REIR fails to provide adequate identification 12

13 and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the analysis of

14 alternatives in the REIR nor Respondents' certification of the REIR in this respect is supported

15 by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

16 139. CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable rangc of alternatives," Guidelines §

17 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if to some
18 degrec they would limit accomplishment of the Project's objectives, or would be more costly.
19
Guidelines $15126.6(b).
20

21 140. Rcspondents failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that lessened

22 the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential alternatives to

23 the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the basic

24 objectives of the project and could avoid 01 substantially lessen one or more of the significant
25 cffects." Guidelincs § 15126.6(c).
26 141. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification
27
and analysis of mcasures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse cnvironmental impacts and 28

-

2 fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither the analysis of mitigation

3 mcasures nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by substantial

4 evidence in the administrative record.

5 142. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will substantially

6 lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those mitigation

7

8 measurcs in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines 15126.4. A

lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable without requiring the
9 imposition of all fcasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less than significant levels.
10

11 Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.

12 143. CEQA also requircs that an agency must adopt a "statemont of overriding considerations"

13 for any significant effects which have not been mitigated lo a level of insignificance by

14 mitigation measurcs or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find "that specific
15 overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project outweigh the
16 significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The statement of overriding
17

18 considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.5;

19 Guidclinos § 15093(b).

20 144. Respondents adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible mitigation

21 measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21081;

22

23 Guidelines § 15092. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings regarding the

24 Projcct's impacts. Respondents also approved the Project based on one or more written findings

25 that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse environmental

26 impacts, but there is not substantial cvidence in the administrative record to support all such

27 findings. Moreover, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more non-written

28 findings that such considerations exist.

Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 2

1 2. Section q of RESOLUTION 2020- Approved and Adopted by the Moreno Valley City Council on June 16, 2020 also included: REPEAL OF
2 RESOLUTIÓN NO. 2015-56 "That Resolution No. 2015-56 which certified the previous Final EIR and adopted findings, the MMRP and the Statement of
3 Overriding Considerations, is hereby repealed and set aside as ordered by Hon. Judge Waters in the Peremptory Writ of Mandate dated June 12, 2018 (Case No: RIC 1510967 [MFJ)
3• The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report for the World Logistics Center is the second attempt by the City of Moreno Valley to comply with the Riverside County Superior Court Judgment and Peremptory Writ of Mandate setting aside the August 2015 Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the World Logistics Center (WLC). The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact was preceded by the July 2018 Revised Sections of the
9 FEIR (RSFEIR) circulated to the public for review and comment by the City of Moreno Valley. The July 2018 RSFEIR and the City's responses to public
10 comments on that document are incorporated into the subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report.
11

12 4. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the "take" (Kill, capture or habitat destruction) of listed endangered or threatened species. In a like
13 manner, the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) prohibits the "take" of endangered or threatened species listed by the California Fish and Game
14 Commission. Under the 2004 Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) / Natural Communities Conservation Plan
15 (NCCP Act) the "take" of 146 plant and animal species is permitted for 75

16 years throughout western Riverside County, in exchange for the assembly and management of coordinated MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Areas. The most
17 prominent Conservation Area is the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) located immediately on the
18 southern boundary of the proposed World logistics Center (WLC).

19 5. Both the federal and state endangered species statutes provide for exceptions to their "take" prohibitions. The federal exception requires applicants to submit a
20 Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). If approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

21 Service, the applicant will be issued an incidental "take" permit (the MSHCP). The California "take" exception is authorized pursuant to the
22 Natural Community Conservation Planning Act (Fish and Game Code §§ 2800- 2835). After approval of a NCCP Act Conservation Plan, the CDFW permits the
23 "take" of covered species whose conservation and management is provided for in the NCCP approved by CDFW. The NCCP Act section 2826 provides: "Nothing
24 in this chapter exempts a project proposed in a natural community planning

25 area from Division 13 (commencing with section 21000) of the Public Resources Code [CEQA - California Environmental Quality Act] or otherwise alters the
26 applicability of that division.'

27

28 Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet, Paulek 3

6. In performing the necessary/required analysis of the WLC impacts on Biological Resources the City of Moreno Valley must acknowledge/recognize the
2 City is a signatory to the 1995 Stephens' Kangaroo Rat Habität Conservation Plan (SKRHCP) and the 2004 Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
( v (MSHCP/NCCP). Most importantly, the City of Moreno Valley must acknowledge/recognize the San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) immediately adjacent to the southern boundary of the World logistics Center project site, is

5 the principle designated Conservation Area/Reserve for both of these "take" permits. Both the initial August 2015 Final EIR and the subject Revised Final
6 Environmental Impact Report failed to address the mandatory significant impact of the "take" of MSHCP Covered Species (CFQA Guideline §
7 15065(a)(1)(3)) in accordance with the mandates of CEQA.
7. The subject Revised Final EIR fails to follow the substantives mandates of
4D CEQA and consequently fails to require adoption of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would lessen or avoid significant impacts to Biological
10 Resources. Petitioners accordingly request that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094-5 directing
11 Respondent to vacate and set aside the approvals of the WLC Project and certification of the Revised Final EIR.
12

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094-5,
15 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
16

17 9. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because Respondent and the proposed site of the WLC Project are located in Riverside
18 County.

19 THE PARTIES
20 10. Petitioner/Plaintiff ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK (Paulek) is a retired (28.5
21 years) Department of Fish and Wildlife Associate Wildlife Biologist and was the area manager of the Department's San Jacinto wildlife Area (SJWA) from 1991 to
22 2006. Paulek is a Certified Wildlife Biologist having extensive knowledge and

23 experience working with the wildlife resources and conservation programs of western Riverside County and the state of California. Paulek participated in the
24 CEQA review of the WLC Project as an individual and as the Conservation Chair of the Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley. Petitioners seek to compel the
25 City of Moreno Valley to properly implement its CEQA duties to avoid and Mitigate Project impacts to the plant and animal resources of western Riverside
26 County and the state of California and to conserve existing and future wildlife habitat values of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area.

11 13. Respondent CITY OF MORENO VALLEY was incorporated in 1984 as a

12 general law city. A council-manager government governs the City. The City is divided into five districts, each of which elects a representative to the City

13 Council. On June 16, 2020 the Moreno Valley City Council voted to approve the WLC Development Agreement, Tentative Parcel Map 36457 and certified the

6 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

~l
4D 00 18. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in paragraph 1 through 17 inclusive.

10 19. The public lands of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area immediately south and contiguous with the WLC Specific Plan southern boundary were acquired by the

11 Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) in fee simple in May 2001. The WCB minutes of May 18, 20014 indicates the acquisition of these public lands were

12 funded using the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2000 (Proposition 12).

13

14 20. The May 18, 2001 WCB minutes indicate funding for these SJWA wildlife conservation lands was made pursuant to Proposition 12 § 5096.350 (a)(3) T&E

15 for the restoration or acquisition from a willing seller of habitat for threatened

16 and endangered species or for the purpose of promoting the recovery of those species. Proposition 12 made the funds available for the expenditure by the WCB

17 for "acquisition, development, rehabilitation, restoration and protection of real property benefiting fish and wildlife, for the acquisition, restoration, or

18 protection, of habitat that promotes the recovery of threatened, endangered or fully protected species, maintain the genetic integrity of wildlife populations and
fragmentation..".

19 serves as corridors linking otherwise separate habitat to prevent habitat

20

21 21. The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) was created in 2004 to implement the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan

22 (MSHCP). The MSHCP impetus is to assure the conservation of 146 species of plants and animals on designated reserve lands [the SJWA is the most significant

23 MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Reservel in order to mitigate the "take" [loss] of

24 species incidental to the development of lands not designated for MSHCP/NCCP conservation. Similarly, the SKR Habitat Conservation Plan [state and federal

25 endangered species "take" permits] includes the SJWA as a primary "Core" reserve to mitigate the incidental habitat impact resulting from the development
of lands not designated for SKR conservation.

28 Submitted with Petitioner's comment letters on the Draft EIR, April 5, 2013 and the Final EIR, June 9, 2015 9, for

Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 6

22. Of the 1.26 million acres covered by the MSHCP/NCCP, 500,000 acres are designated for wildlife conservation. Of that half million acres, 347,000 acres
2 were already conserved as public or quasi-public land. The acquisition of the remaining 153,000 acres [additional Reserve Lands] for MSHCP/NCCP wildlife
3 conservation is the primary function of the RCA. After the 2004 approval of the MSHCP/NCCP, the 2001 WCB Proposition 12 SJWA land acquisition of approximately 1,000 acres was immediately included in the MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Area and counted as Additional Reserve Lands.
23. In February 2012 the CEQA Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the initial WLC Draft EIR [the Draft/Final EIR the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate subsequently repealed and set aside] was circulated to the public, Trustee and Responsible

8 agencies for comment. Petitioners March 22, 2012 NOP response letter advised the City of Moreno Valley that the NOP was deceptive in that the WLC Specific

9 Plan wrongly identified the public lands acquired by the WCB in May 2001 as the CDFW Conservation Buffer Area. Similarly, the March 22, 2012 NOP
10 response letter from the California Department of Fish and Gamez, the state agency having jurisdiction by law over fish and wildlife resources, advised the
11 City of Moreno Valley regarding the defective Project description, the need for

12 compliance with the requirements of CEQA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP and the incidental "take" permits for endangered, threatened and/or candidate species
13 (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.).

14 24. The initial Draft EIR [repealed and set aside by the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate] was released for public and agency review in February 2013. The
15 CEQA review presented by the City of Moreno Valley and the Project proponent

16 fashioned straw man fallacies using the "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" and the proposed SJWA "Open Space" designation. In doing so they sought to avoid
17 addressing the mandatory significant impacts to biological resources the WLC project will realize. The straw man fallacies were presented in the EIR to avoid
18 the required CEQA consideration of significant impacts to the public lands of the SJWA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP, and the wildlife conservation mandates of the
19 state of California.

20 25. The Revised Final Environmental Impact Report (Draft Recirculated

21 RSFEIR), the subject of this CEQA challenge, misrepresents the 2018 Ruling on the Peremptory Writ of Mandate wrongly asserting:
22 "The Judge found that substantial portions of the FEIR did comply with CEQA
23 so that, only portions of the RSFEIR had to be circulated for public review and comment. (Draft Recirculated RSFEIR pages 2-2 and 2-3)
24

25 No such assertion occurs anywhere in Judge Waters ruling. To the contrary Judge Waters ruling specifically states:
26
The Department's name was changed to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) on January 1, 27 2013.
28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 7

- "In issuing this writ and its February 8, 2018 Ruling, the Court does not make
2 the required finding, including finding of severability, under Public Resources Code section 21168.9(b) partially limiting this writ to a portion of a determination, finding, or to the specific activity or activities found to in

4 noncompliance. For these reasons, the EIR is voided in whole." [emphasis added] (June 14, 2018 Peremptory Writ of Mandate).
5 26. The City of Moreno Valley assertion that only portions of the RSFEIR had to
Cn be circulated for public review and comment is false. The City's current falsehood is analogous to the City's use of the term "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" in the analysis of the Biological Resource section of the challenged 2015 Final EIR.
8 The Court ruling on the Writ of Mandate agrees the City's analysis 'distorts CEQA analysis of the impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources and
9 habitats on the adjacent San Jacinto Wildlife Area and Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) lands." The court agrees
10 the "false labeling" ... "gives the false impression that the area [CDFW Conservation Buffer] can be considered mitigation of significant impacts on
11 biological resources and habitat." Most importantly the Court orders all references to the false "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" should be removed and
12 the ".potential environmental impacts on biological resources and habitats
13 should be re-analyzed without any consideration of said buffer area." [emphasis added] (February 8, 2018 Ruling on Peremptory Writ of Mandate)
14 27, The City of Moreno Valley has yet to re-analyze the direct, indirect and
15 cumulative impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies since the initiation of the WLC Project in
16 2012 by submitting written and oral comments to the City of Moreno Valley prior

17 to the Project approvals to request compliance with CEQA and the completion of a full and adequate environmental review. All issues raised in this petition were
18 raised before Respondent by Petitioners, other members of the publie, or public agencies prior to the approval of the project.
19 28. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
20 prior service of a notice upon the City of Moreno Valley indicating its intent to file

21 this petition. Proof of Service of this notification with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

22 29. Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-
23 captioned proceedings or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to
24 Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.

25 30. Petitioners have served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's
26 office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is
27 attached as Exhibit C.

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 8

31. Petitioners have filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied
2 with Pub. Res. Code 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D.

3 32. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code

4 section 21167 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112.

5 33. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the following ways:

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
8 VIOLATION OF CEQA (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000, et seq•)
9 The City of Moreno Valley did not Comply with CEQA

10 34• Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
11 35. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature
12 declared it is the policy of the state to: "prevent the elimination of fish and

13 wildlife species due to man's activities, insure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generation
14 representatives of all plant and animal communities... ' (Public Resources Code § 21001(c)). "Public agencies should not approve projects if there are feasible
15 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures, which would substantially lessen significant environmental effects of such projects, and that the
16 procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in

17 systematically identifying both the significant effects of the proposed project and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will
18 avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002). The purpose of an Environmental Impact
19 Report (EIR) is to identify the Significant effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in which those
20 significant effects can be mitigated or avoided." [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002.1(a).
21

22 36. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that Complies with the requirements of the Statute. The Lead agency must also provide for
23 public review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that
24 decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects. The City of Moreno Valley certification of the WLC
25 Revised Final Environmental Impact Report constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

26 discretion. ..the policy of the state that noncompliance with the information disclosure provisions of this division [CEQA] which precludes relevant
27 information from being presented to the public agency, or noncompliance

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 9

4 with substantive requirements of this division, may constitute a prejudicial

2 abuse of discretion.. [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21005(a)).

3 37. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Respondents:
a. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the projects impacts on the environment, inceluding but not limited to, the project's impacts on Biological Resources, the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, the MSHCP and the SKRHCP.
b. Failed to provide a stable, consistent and adequate description of the project, which prohibited an accurate depiction of the project's impacts on the
environment.

C. Failed to provide an adequate description of existing environmental settings of the project, vicinity, and regional context.
10

11 d, Failed to adopt a consistent and appropriate environmental "baseline" for analysis of the project's environmental impacts that contributed to the EIR's

12 flawed analysis of environmental impacts.

13 e. Failed to adequately identify and analyze the project's biological resource

14 impacts-including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the SJWA, the MSHCP, the SKRHCP and wildlife resources.

15 f.

16 Failed to adequately identify, analyze and adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives that would minimize direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on biological resources.

17

18 g. Improperly relied upon regional plans to avoid full disclosure and mitigation of the project's impacts.

19 h. Improperly deterred impact analysis and mitigation measures in contravention

20 of CEQA requirements that mitigation measures be clearly defined and enforceable.

21 i

22 Failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or avoid significant impacts in direct contravention of CEQA substantive mandate that all

23 feasible mitigation measures be adopted to avoid or reduce t project's significant and potentially significant impacts.

24

25 j. Failed to consider reasonable range of alternatives by improperly dismissing feasible alternatives, including those recommended by the public, trustee and

26 responsible agencies and relying upon an improperly narrow list of project objectives to justify the elimination of feasible alternatives.

27

28 Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 10

2 k. Failed to properly disclose, analyze or mitigation conflicts with existing local, state and federal laws.

1.
U Failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by the public and governmental agencies during review of the EIR.

Ou m. Failed to recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR, despite the availability of significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.

~
0 00 n. Failed to adopt an adequate Mitigating Monitoring and Reporting Program in

o. order to assure that the mitigation measures and program revisions identified in the EIR are implemented.

10 Failed to adopt adequate findings that alternatives to the project and proposed

11 mitigation measures and alternatives that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the project were infeasible and failed to disclose the

12 readily available mitigation measures and alternatives that would meet the basic project objectives.

13

14 38. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by

15 approving the project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. On August 19, 2015, the City Council for the City of Moreno Valley ("City") approved the

3 World Logistics Center Project ("Project") -- a 2,610 acre, 40+ million square foot warehouse

4 complex that would be larger than New York's Central Park and may be the largest development of

5 its kind in the world. On the same day, the City also approved a final environmental impact report

6 ("Final EIR") that purports but fails to analyze the widespread impacts of the Project's construction

7 and operation.

R 2. Several entities challenged this approval under the California Environmental Quality Act

O ("CEQA"). In 2018, Riverside County Superior Court issued a ruling in Petitioners' CEQA action

10 identifying deficiencies in five issue areas in the FEIR: energy, biological resources and habitat,
11 noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. This matter is being considered by the Court of Appeals.

12 3. In July 2018, the City released a document entitled Revised Sections of the Final

13 Environmental Impact Report ("RSFEIR"), and in December 2019, the City released a document

14 entitled Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Draft
15 Recirculated RSFEIR*).

16 In April 2020, the City rcleased a Revised Final Environmental Impact Report (the "Revised

17 FEIR") containing its Response to Comments on and revisions to the RSFEIR and Draft

18 Recirculated RSFEIR.

19 5. On or about May 15, 2020, the City's Planning Commission certified the Revised FEIR,
20 approved a tentative parcel map for the Project, and recommended approval of a Development
21 Agreement for the Project.

22 6. Two appeals were filed, including an appeal by the Petitioners filing this lawsuit.

23 7. On June 16, 2020, the City Council denied the appeals of the Planning Commission's actions
24 and approved both the Revised FEIR and the tentative parcel map.

25 8. On July 7, 2020, the City Council approved the Development Agreement for this Project.

26 Due to the size of the Project, the City's action to approve the World Logistics Center
27 commits approximately 10% of the City's total land mass to be developed and used solely for

28 I warehouses and distribution centers, or other logistics support, indefinitely. If the Project is

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

constructed and operated as planned, residents of the City and its surrounding areas will see a future

2 that is dominated by large-scale massive warehouse developments, increased truck shipments and

3 traffic, and even worse air quality than they already experience.

4 10. Several governmental agencies, organizations, and individuals expressed deep concerns

5 about the Project and the associated environmental review conducted by the City throughout the

6 City's decision-making process. These concerns were also echoed by the California Air Resources

7 Board ("ARB"), which was just as concerned about the implications of the Project's dramatic

8 increase in heavy-duty truck traffic, and the resulting public health impacts that could not be

9 addressed by the City's currently proposed mitigation measures, set forth in the Revised FEIR. The

10 California Department of Fish and Wildlife also expressed significant concerns about the impacts of

11 the Project on biological resources.

12 11. As noted in the comments submitted by these entities and individuals, including Petitioners
13 and Plaintiffs (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Petitioners"), as well as others, there are

14 myriad concerns stemming from the Project's environmental and public health impacts. The size of

15 the Project alone, with its estimated thousands of truck trips per day, will substantially add to the

16 cxisting presence of ozone, ozonc precursors, and other contaminants, such as carcinogenic dicsel

17 particulate matter, in an air basin that already suffers from some of the worst air quality in the nation.
18 This additional air pollution will only exacerbate the serious, direct health impacts already

19 experienced by nearby residents, including the impacts of Covid-19, as well as impacts from noise
20 caused by the construction and operation of the Project. In addition, the Project will contribute

21 unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions that will add to, rather than reduce

22 climate change impacts. As a result, the Project directly conflicts with existing State GHG reduction
23 goals. The Project will also impose severe and detrimental impacts to a variety of imperiled specics,

24 habitats and other biological resources. Yet, the Project's environmental review document and the

25 City's environmental review process have failed to adequately address these impacts.

26 12. The City has also failed to require re-circulation of the EIR in light of critical information
27 that must be analyzed in the document, and for which the public must be allowed the opportunity to
28 provide comments. These and many additional fatal flaws in the Revised FEIR's analyses have led

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELTEF

Petitioners and their organizational members to become deeply concerned by the City's decision to
2 approve this Project. Given the scope and significant impacts of the Project, it is critical that the City
3 comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

4 Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of
5 Regulations, section 15000 et seq., before moving forward on project of this scale. To date, the

6 City has failed to do so.

7 13. As a result, Petitioners bring this action on their behalf, on behalf of their members, the

8 gencral public, and in the public interest, to compel the City to adhere to CEQA's critical

9 environmental review and mitigation requirements designed to maintain a high-quality, healthy
10  environment for all Californians.

11 I. PARTIES

12 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

13 JUSTICE ("CCAEJ*) is a membership-based California non-profit environmental health and justice
14 organization with its primary membership in and around Riverside County. CCAEJ's mission is to

15 bring people together to improve their social and natural environment, and to build community
16 power in order to create safor, healthier, toxic free places to live, work, lcarn and play in and around
17 the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino. CCAEJ has its physical offices in Jurupa Valley and
18 organizes to build leadership for community action in Jurupa Valley, Mira Loma, in the City and the
19 Count of Riverside, as well as other cities throughout the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino.

20 CCAEJ has identified the City as a "community at risk" for various environmental injustices
21 including bearing a disproportionate share of the impacts from high polluting industries, heavy-duty
22 diesel truck and other mobile source emissions, and suffering other disparities created by zoning and
23 irrcsponsible land use planning. Accordingly, CCAEJ, together with co-petitioners to this action and
24 other environmental groups, filed extensive comments that are part of the administrative record for
25 the City's approval of the Project and Revised FEIR. CCAEJ's members are extremely concerned
26 that the Project will detrimentally impact their health and wellbeing, and the health and wellbeing of
27 their children, their community, and the environment, and that it will detrimentally impact the area's
28 surrounding resources. Most of CCAEJ's members who reside in and around Riverside County and

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 around the proposed site for the Project already suffer a disproportionate burden from existing

3 stationary and mobile sources of pollution, including significant air pollution from, inter alia, the

4 movement of goods throughout the region to existing warehouses and other large-scale storage and
distribution centers.

5 15,

6 Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a

7 nonprofit corporation with offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere throughout

8 California and the United States. The Center is actively involved in environmental protection issues

9 throughout California and North America and has over 70,000 members, including many throughout

10 California and in Riverside County. The Center's mission includes protecting and restoring habitat

11 and populations of imperiled species, reducing GHG pollution to preserve a safe climate, and

12 protecting air quality, water quality, and public health. The Center's members and staff include

13 individuals who regularly use and intend to continue to use the areas in Riverside County and

14 elsewhere affected by the Project, including numerous members who are particularly interested in

15 protecting the native, endangered, imperiled, and sensitive species and habitats found in the San

16 Jacinto Wildlife Area ("SJWA"), that will be detrimentally impacted by the construction and

17 operation of the Project. As such, the Center has submitted extensive comments to the City,

18 throughout its decision-making process regarding the Project, which are now part of the

19 administrative record of the City's decision to approve the Project and its Revised FEIR.

16.

20 Petitioner and Plaintiff COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR ("CCA") is a California nonprofit

21 organization that is dedicated to restoring clean healthy air to California by advocating for effective

22 public policy and practical business solutions. For the past 50 years CCA has made significant

23 improvements to California's air by advocating for innovative policy solutions through both state

24 and federal legislation; encouraging the carly adoption of new tochnologies; advising businesses on

25 regulatory compliance and clean air practices, and empowering its allies with technical and policy

26 expertise to educate decision-makers and the public on air pollution solutions. CCA has offices in

27 Los Angeles and Sacramento, and has a direct interest in protecting and improving the quality of the

28 air in Southern California and throughout the State. As such, CCA submitted comments to the City,

6
VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

during its decision-making process regarding the Project, which are now part of the administrative

2 record of the City's decision to approve the Project and its Revised Final EIR.

3 17. Petitioner and Plaintiff SIERRA CLUB is a national nonprofit organization of approximately

4 799,000 members. Sierra Club is dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of

5 the earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to

6 educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human

7 environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club's particular

8 interest in this casc stems from the Sierra Club's local San Gorgonio Chapter's interests in

9 preserving the native, endangered, imperiled and sensitive species and wildlife habitats of the

10 SJWA; decreasing rather than increasing heavy-duty and medium-duty truck traffic in an already

11 highly overburdened air basin; and ensuring that good, livable, and healthy jobs are brought to the

12 area. The members of the San Gorgonio Chapter live, work, and recreate in an around the areas that

13 will be directly affected by the construction and operation of the Project. Sierra Club submitted

14 extensive comments to the City throughout its environmental review process for the Project, which

15 are part of the City's record of its decision to approve the Project and its Revised Final EIR.

16 18. Pctitioner and Plaintiff SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY AUDUBON SOCIETY ("SBVAS")

17 is a local chapter of the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit corporation that focuses on inspiring

18 and mobilizing people nationwide to protect hundreds of bird species and their habitats through
19 conservation, education and advocacy efforts. Founded in 1948, the SBVAS chapter area covers
20 almost all of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, including the Project site. The SBVAS chapter

21 has approximately 2,000 members, about half of whom live in Riverside County and regularly

22 engage in the bird watching, conservation, education and advocacy activities to protect bird species

23 In and around the area where the Project construction and opcration will take placc. The SBVAS'

24 mission extends beyond the preservation of bird species and includes the preservation of imperiled

25 and sensitive habitats throughout the area for all wildlife, and maintenance of the quality of life in

26 the Inland Empire. As such, the SBVAS chapter is particularly concerned with the impacts that the
27 construction and operation of the Project will have on various species, including but not limited to,

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 bird species in the SJWA, in and around the City and throughout Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.

3 19.

4 By this action, Petitioners seek to protect the health, welfare, and economic interests of their

5 members and the general public and to enforce the City's duties under CEQA. Petitioners' members
and staff have an

6 interest in their health and well-being, in the health and well-being of others,

7 including the residents of the City, its surrounding areas in Riverside County, and in the region.

8 Petitioners also have a strong interest in conserving and protecting the environment, the aesthetic

9 and ecological integrity of the areas surrounding the Project arca, and cconomic interests in

10 Riverside County. Petitioners' staff and members who live and work near the Project also have a

11 right to and a beneficial interest in the City's compliance with CEQA. These interests have been, and

12 continue to be, threatened by the City's decision to certify the Revised FEIR and approve the Project

13 in violation of CEQA. Unless the relief requested in this case is granted, Petitioners' staff and

14 members will continue to be adversely affected and irreparably injured by the City's failure to
comply with CEQA.

15 20.

16 Respondent and Defendant CITY OF MORENO VALLEY is a municipally funded, general a

17 law City, incorporated, organized and existing under the laws of the state of California since the yoar
1984, with the capacity to sue and be sued.
18 21.

19 As referred to herein, "the City" consists of all councils including the current five-member
City Council, boards, commissions and departments including the current Planning and/or Land Use
20 Department and/or the City's Planning Commission.
21 22. The City is the "lead agency" as the term is defined by CEQA, and is therefore charged with
22 principal responsibility for carrying out or approving the Project, and for evaluating the Project's
23

24 environmental impacts pursuant to CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21067.)
23.

25 The City approved the Project and certified the Revised FEIR at issue in this case, and based

10 and by the ensuing environmental and public health consequences that will be caused by the
11 construction and operation of the Project, as approved.

12 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

13 A. Community and Environmental Setting

14 49. Moreno Valley spans a total of 51.5 square miles of the Western portion of Riverside

15 County, located in the Inland Empire. It is surrounded by the citics of Riverside and Perris, the
16 March Air Rcservc Basc, Lakc Pcrris and Lakc Perris Statc Park, the San Timotco Badlands, and the

17 SJWA - an approximately 19,000-acre state conservation arca, a portion of which shares an
18 approximately 2 mile border with the Project.

19 50. The City has a population of approximately 210,639 residents,' a small fraction of the over 2

20 million people living in Riverside County who will be subject to the immediate and direct

21 environmental impacts of the Project.

22 51. In the past several ycars, Riverside County and, specifically, the portion of the County where
23 the City is located, have sccn a dramatic influx of largc-scalc warchousc devclopment, impacting the

24 health of its residents, and the environment.

-*6 52.

2 square The City is already home to one of the largest warehouses in the region --a 1.82 million

3 foot distribution center - and, in addition to the Project, will likely see at least two other
large-scale warehouse developments in the very near future.

4 53.

5 Notably, Riverside County and the City are over 80 miles away from the nearest ports, yet,

6 much of the area's recent development has been geared.towards receiving goods from those ports,
for storage, sale, and distribution.

7 54.

8 As a result of increased and continued industrial growth throughout the Inland Empire,

9 including a growing concentration of storage and distribution centers throughout Riverside County

10 and in the City, vchicle and truck traffic throughout the area has increased, causing severe traffic
issues on

11 55. Riverside County roads, and along the region's interstate highways.

12 Indeed, the rapid increase in the construction and operation of warehouses, storage and

13 distribution centers in the area has been recognized as an environmental, public health and policy

14 concern by California government agencies and the State's executive officers, including the

15 Attorney General and the ARB. On the basis of comment letters filed by these agencies, Petitioners

16 are informed and therefore believe that these State officers and agencies are especially concerned

17 with the lack of environmental review conducted to analyze the environmental consequences of

18 large-scale commercial sales, storage and distribution centers like the Project, and the lack of

19 consideration for the traffic, air pollution and public health impacts these projects bring with them.
56.

20 The part of Riverside County where the City is located falls under the jurisdiction of the

21 SCAQMD - the regional air pollution control agency with authority to regulate the "critical air

22 pollution problems" throughout the South Coast Air Basin ("Basin"), which includes all of Orange

23 County and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. (Health
& Safety Code § 40402(b).) §

24 57.

25 SCAQMD is specifically responsible for clean air planning in and throughout the Basin,

26 pursuant to the Clean Air Act. The air quality planning SCAQMD conducts is critical to meeting

27 national air pollution control standards set forth under the Clean Air Act, including the National

28 Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") aimed at reducing the presence of contaminants of
concern that severely impact public health and the environment, which contribute to climate change.

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 These contaminants include but are not limited to, nitrogen oxide ("NOx"), particulate matter

2 ("PM'), which produces soot, ground-level ozone (or "smog"), and ozone precursors that are highly

3 prevalent throughout the Basin, and specifically in the Western portion of Riverside County where

4 the City is, and where the Project will be located.

5 58. The Basin experiences complex and significant air quality issues caused by an extremely

6 high concentration of a variety of industrial activities and on-road vehicle traffic including diesel

7 emissions from heavy-duty truck traffic. As a result, the Basin exceeds federal public health

8 standards for both ozone and PM, resulting in its residents experiencing some of the worst air

9 pollution in the nation.

10 59. The Western portion of Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the area specifically
11 surrounding the City have been identified as air pollution hot spots by air quality regulators
12 including SCAQMD for decades. This area suffers some of the worst PM concentrations in the

13 nation as a result of pollution blowing in from both Los Angeles and Orange counties, combined
14 with high concentrations of air pollution from other sources farther east that become trapped by
15 surrounding mountain ranges. The area has also experienced worsening air quality as a result of
16 increascd dicsel pollution from trucks used to transport goods into the region's growing number of
17 warehouses and other storage and distribution facilities. Notably, diesel exhaust, or diesel particulate

18 matter ("DPM"), which is highly prevalent throughout the Basin and throughout Riverside and San
19 Bernardino counties, contains dangerous levels of PM, carbon, soot, and other harmful and
20 carcinogenic contaminants that can cause a host of short-term acute exposure impacts such as

21 respiratory diseases, including asthma, and lung cancer.

22 60. ARB, the state agency charged with monitoring the regulatory activity of California's 35
23 local air districts including SCAQMD, has determined that diesel exhaust is responsible for over 70
24 percent of the health risks associated with air pollution statewide. SCAQMD has likewise

25 determined that DPM accounts for over 68 percent of the health risks associated with breathing air in
26 and around the Basin.

27 61. Consistent and continued exposure to DPM is, therefore, a serious concern for Basin
28 residents and particularly for those residing along heavy-duty truck thoroughfares. Interstate

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

highway 15 (*1-15") and state route 60 ("SR 60") are just some of the thoroughfares that especially
2 impact Riverside County, City residents and residents of the areas surrounding the City. Other
3 thoroughfares such as highway 710 ("I-710") and state routes 91 and 22, also impact numerous
residents living closer to the ports. These residents suffer impacts from heavy pollution caused by
5 ships and port-based pollution sources in addition to increased truck traffic to ship goods out of the

6 port area to storage and distribution centers located at far distances. Residents who live along these
7 and other thoroughfares experience some of the region's most concentrated vehicle traffic and

8 breathe some its most polluted air. Most of these residents also lack the financial means to address
9 the health problems caused by these exposurcs. Children, who are among the most vulnerable
10 residents, are not only subject to these avoidable health impacts, but they also experience some of
11 the highest rates of school absences, which means lost work days for parents and caregivers, all of
12 which only further impacts families and these communities.

13 62. The introduction of the COVID-19 virus into these communities places them at even greater
14 risk because people exposed to elevated levels of air pollution face worse outcomes if they contract
15 the virus.

16 63. In addition to the region's grave DPM, ozone, and other PM emission concentrations, the
17 Basin and the western portion of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, like the rest of the state, are
18 experiencing increased impacts from climate change including decreasing water supply and rainfall
19 as well as increasing temperatures, which often exacerbate air pollution concentrations.
20 64. GHG emissions contribute to local, regional, and global climate change impacts and, as such,
21 they have been the subject of increased statewide regulatory efforts.
22 65. ARB and the Governor's office have adopted rigorous goals and standards to decrease the
23 state's GHG omissions, and to decrcase the impacts from climate change. Some of these targets have
24

25

26

27

28

15
VERTFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P been codified into state law, and others have been declared by executive order, or by agency action.2

2 The thrust of many of the State's most recent efforts has been to actively limit GHG emissions, e

3 recognizing that a pure "business as usual" approach will only exacerbate and accelerate the impacts

4 of climate change, rather than help to reduce and slow its negative consequences.3 In setting forth its

5 GHG reduction efforts, the State has emphasized the importance of local agency involvement, and

6 local agency commitments to reducing GHG emissions through their policy and planning processes.

7 Continued coordination between State, regional, and local entities is instrumental to ensuring the

8 efficacy of the State's policies and to cnabling the State to reach its reduction targets.

9 66. In addition to impacting human health and resource availability and access over time, climate

10 change also directly impacts the environment, including the presence and viability of numerous

I biological species and their habitats throughout the State and locally, within Riverside County.
12 Many native, sensitive, and imperiled species and their habitats are found in and around the City,

13 and many are located in the immediate vicinity of the Project.

14 67. The SJWA's total 19,000 acres is home to a number of imperiled biological species, many of

15 which are native to California. Others migrating through the Pacific Flyway - a migratory bird
16 passago that oxtonds from the southernmost tip of South Amorica along the Pacific Occan, to the
17 North Slope of Alaska - also rely on the SJWA en route. 9,000 acres of the SJWA is also comprised

18 of restored wetlands, which provide critical habitats to these migratory birds as well as terrestrial

19 species that may also migrate to the area in search of limited water.

20 68. Just some of the animal and plant species that are found in the SJWA include: the Burrowing

21 Owl (a species of special concern, whose viability is threatened by continued urban and sub-urban

22

23 See e.g., Health and Safety Code 38500 et seq., the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 [setting forth a statewide requirement to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 - a
24 roduction of approximately 15 percent below emissions expected under a "business as usual" scenario

25 and requiring ARB to adopt regulations to achieve the maximun technologically feasible and cost- effective GHG emission reductions; to mitigate risks associated with climate change; improve energy 26 efficiency; and expand the use of renewable energy resources, cleaner transportation, and waste reduction practices].
27 See id., see also, California State Executive Order B-30-15, April 29, 2015, Governor Edmund G. Brown [increasing the state's GHG reduction target to achieve 40% below 1990 leyel reductions by

development); the Tri-Colored Blackbird (a bird that has received emergency protection status in

2 2014, and whose population remains in rapid decline); the fully protected California Golden Eagle;

3 25 species of raptors and at least 65 of the 146 species of plants and animals covered by the Western

4 Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan, including the Los Angeles pocket

5 mouse (a threatened and State special status species native to the San Bernardino and Riverside

6 County areas). The SJWA is also home to three threatened and endangered plant species such as the

7 Spreading Navarretia, Threadleaved Brodiaca, and the San Jacinto Crownscale.

8 69. A significant portion of the land found in the arca immediately adjacent to the approved

9 Project is used specifically for habitat and species conservation, and is comprised of the part of the

10 SJWA and reserve lands that are governed by the Western Riverside County Multiple Species
11 Habitat Conservation Plan. In addition to conservation uses, there are a few residences and small
12 family farmns in the vicinity of where the Project's 2,610 acre warehouse complex will be constructed
13 and will operate.

14 B. The Project and Its Environmental Impacts

15 70. The Project involves construction and operation of a 40.6 million square foot warehouse
16 complex, which, according to the EIR and other approval documents, will be used to provide a-major

17 logistics center to accommodate an undefined "portion" of the trade volumes at the Ports of Los

18 Angeles and Long Beach.

19 71. The total area needed to effectuate the Project's construction and operations include
20 committing almost 4,000 acres within the City to indefinite future use for logistics - receiving and

21 distributing shipments by truck, conducting sales, and offering storage services - or logistics
22 support. Thus, in addition to the 40.6 million square foot or 2,610 acre warehouse envisioned by the
23 Project, the land use changes involved in the Project's approvals commit approximately 10 pcrcent
24 of the City's total land mass to be developed and used solely for warehouses, distribution centers,
25 and associated facilities indefinitely.

26 72. Given the size and scope of the Project, the Project approvals that have been or will be issued
27 by the City include the following: a new Specific Plan and Specific Plan Amendment; a General
28 Plan Amendment; pre-annexation zoning changes for land that has not yet been acquired by Real

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Parties in Interest, but is located within the Project area and is subject to the City's jurisdiction;

2 execution of a development agreement consistent with the construction of the Project as described in
3 its notice and environmental review documents; and adoption or approval of a tentative parcel map

4 to be governed by the Project's approvals and used for the purpose of financing the Project's

5 operations.

6 73. As proposed, the Project will also involve drastic deviations from the City's current General
7 Plan designations and goals, which include, inter alia, (1) properly screening manufacturing and

8 industrial land uses to support mixed-use development and to avoid incrcased traffic flows as well as

9 disruptive construction and operation; (2) mitigating and minimizing where necessary, increased
10 traffic, noise, light, and glare caused by land use activities; and (3) requiring development along
11 scenic roadways to be visually attractive.

12 74. Because the Project involves construction and operation of a warehouse complex that is SO
13 vast in size, the Project will necessarily involve single-use development throughout a vast portion of
14 the City's land; increased traffic flows and will involve disruptive construction and operation as well
15 as high levels of light, fumes, noise, and glare, which will also obstruct scenic views.

16 75. Because the Projcct will also nocessarily attract increased truck and other vehicular traffic,

17 the Project will also significantly impact the air quality in the immediate vicinity of the Project, as

18 well as throughout the City, the County, and the region.

19 76. Moreover, because the Project will be located at least 80 miles away from the nearest port
20 and the only other point of entry for goods that appear likely to be stored at the World Logistics
21 Center is the Ontario Airport, the Project is likely to cause significant impacts along all roadways,
22 thoroughfares, highways and highway corridors linking the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to
23 Morcno Vallcy.
24 C. The City of Moreno Valley's Initial Project Approval and Environmental Review Process
25 1. The City's Draft EIR
26 77. On February 24, 2013, the a City released a Draft EIR for a review and public comment
27 period, which closed on April 8, 2013.

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 78.

2 Hundreds of members of the public, including Petitioners, submitted extensive comments to

3 the City regarding numerous, severe flaws contained in the Draft EIR's analyses. Such comments

4 expressed serious concerns about the Draft EIR's failure to adequately analyze 01® mitigate the

5 Project's significant adverse traffic impacts; its failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the

6 Project's significant and adverse impacts to air quality and human health, including the Project's

7 potentially severe DPM and GHG emissions impacts, as well as its growth inducing impacts.
79.

8 Numerous public commenters, including Petitioners, also discussed at length the Draft EIR's

9 failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant and adverse impacts on biological

10 resources, including imperiled, sensitive, and endangered species and habitats located in the nearby

11 SJWA. These comments specifically highlighted the Draft EIR's omission of mitigation measures

12 necessary to address the impacts that both construction and operation of the Project will have on the
wildlife habitats.

13

14 80. 2. The City's Final EIR and Draft Statement of Overriding Consideration

15 On May 1, 2015, the Final EIR was released for a 45-day comment period. At the same time,

16 the City also prepared and released for comment a draft Statement of Overriding Considerations

17 outlining the overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the Project that
allegedly outweigh the significant effects on the environment.

18 81.

19 Given that the Final EIR failed to address the Draft EIR's deficiencies, Petitioners repeated

20 their concerns about the Final EIR's failure to, inter alia: adequately analyze the Project's impacts in

21 a project-level, rather than a programmatic EIR again, in light of the project-level details contained

22 in the City's draft development agreement; its failure to adequately evaluate and mitigate the

23 Project's significant traffic, air quality, public health, and environmental impacts, with specific

24 emphasis on its failure to adequately disclose and evaluate the Project's GHG, DPM and other toxic

25 air emissions as well as its failure to adequately analyze the Project's impacts to endangered,

26 imperiled, and sensitive biological species and habitats of the SJWA; and its inclusion of significant
new information.

27

28

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

i. Significant New Information and Changes

2 82. Petitioners and other commenters, including ARB, further noted that the Final EIR's

3 inclusion of new information that was omitted from the Draft EIR or unknown at the time of its

4 publication triggered yet another reason to re-draft, re-notice and re-circulate the full Final EIR

5 pursuant to CEQA.

6 83. In particular, the new information, which Petitioners and others noted in comments, was

7 included in the Final EIR but never studied, addressed, or commented on in the Draft EIR includes

8 the following:

9 A mistaken reliance on the use of a set of adjoining parcels of land purchased by the
2 = State Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") for conservation purposes relating
to the SJWA habitats and species, and which are referred to throughout the Final EIR
12 documents as "CDFW parcels" as a "buffer," and included as part of the Project's

13 "mitigation." Petitioners pointed out the Final EIR's reference to such parcels as a
14 "buffor" was an addition made to the Final EIR document, which was not contained
15 in the Draft EIR, as the Draft EIR described the same parcels as part of the Project.
16 Petitioners pointed out that this amounted to significant new information because it

17 resulted in complete failure to analyze the true impacts that the Project will have on

18 SJWA and other surrounding areas.

19 New mitigation approaches for impacts, including noise, GHG, and air quality,

20 ii. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Impacts
21 84. The Final EIR also included an additional approach to the Project's GHG emissions, which

22 Petitioners and other commenters noted impermissibly excludes a significant portion of the Project's
23 emissions from consideration under CEQA. The Final EIR claimed that although the Project is

24 estimated to result in almost 400,000 metric tons of GHGs annually, over three quarters of those

25 emissions did not need to be analyzed or mitigated because they are "capped" under California's

26 Global Warmming Solutions Act of 2006, known as "AB 3233 an act that requires the ARB to adopt
27 and implement cost-effective "cap and trade" measures to reduce GHG emissions from certain

28 covered sources. ARB has adopted regulations implementing these "cap and trade" measures.

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 85. The Final EIR concluded that because refiners and suppliers of transportation fuels may hold
2 compliance obligations under the AB 32 "cap and trade" regulation, mobile source emissions

3 including emissions from truck traffic did not need to be analyzed or mitigated in the document.

4 86. Notably, however, California law authorizes the "cap and trade" regulation only through the

5 year 2030.

6 87. Petitioners and other commenters thus pointed out that because the Project's GHG emissions

7 would extend beyond the time-frame contemplated by AB 32, and because they dramatically exceed

8 SCAQMD's threshold levcl of significance for GHG emissions, which is 10,000 metric tons - these

9 emissions, which are many times greater than the applicable CEQA threshold levels, could not be
10 dismissed as less than significant under CEQA based on the claim that they are "capped" under
11 AB32.

12 88. Petitioners and others further pointed out that because those emissions have real, known, and

13 potential impacts, including impacts on climate change, they must be analyzed and mitigated

14 pursuant to CEQA, notwithstanding the "cap and trade" regulation. Petitioners also noted the danger

15 in setting forth this type of analysis, which could, in essence, allow project proponents or lead

16 agencics to evade necessary CEQA review of a projcct's severe environmental impacts.
17 ili. Additional Errors and Lack of Substantial Evidence

18 89. Finally, Petitioners pointed out that while the City included a Draft Statement of Overriding

19 Considerations, the Statement and its single supporting document - a report that only generally

20 described but did not state in detail how the Project would lead to good, secure, and stable jobs for
21 surrounding area residents - failed to set forth sufficient, detailed information to support the

22 Statement of Overriding Consideration's claims that the City and its residents would be benefitted by
23 the Project, notwithstanding the significant environmental and public health impacts that a Project of
24 this size and scope brings with it.
25 3. The City's Approval of the Final EIR and Statement of Overriding Considerations

26 90. On June 30, 2015, the Moreno Valley Planning Commission approved the Project with a 6-1
27 vote, despite Petitioners' arguments and comments regarding the severe flaws in the Final EIR's
28 analyses of the Project's public health, air quality, GHG, and biological species impacts, as well as

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

numerous other flawed points of analyses set forth in the Final EIR. After the City Planning
Department issued its approval, and before the Project was to be approved by the City Council,
Petitioners and other commenters continued to submit additional comments, emphasizing the need to
re-evaluate the Project's impacts and urged the City to reject the Final EIR as drafted.
5 91. After the City Planning Department issued its approval, but before the City Council

6 considered whether it would adopt or reject the Planning Department's approval, Petitioners

7 submitted to the City Council an expert report published by the University of Southern California

8 that refuted many of the claims made in the Draft Statement of Overriding Considerations.
9 92. Numerous other organizations and government agencies including the ARB and SCAQMD,
10 among others, also submitted additional comments to the City during the same time frame.
11 93. On August 19, 2015, the City Council decided to approve the Final EIR and the Project on a
12 3-2 vote. In so doing the City also approved the Statement of Overriding Considerations; Project
13 related entitlements, including development agreement between the City and Real Parties in
14 Interest; and General Plan and Specific Plan amendments as well as the Specific Plan for the Project
15 area.

16 94. In September 2015, Petitioners and other environmental, labor, and community organizations
17 initiated CEQA litigation in Riverside County Superior Court challenging the Final EIR and the
18 City's approval of the Project.

19 95. While the CEQA challenge was pending, Highland Fairview circulated initiative petitions in
20 the City that, among other things, purported to repeal and approve the development agreement
21 between the City and the Project applicants. On or before November 24, 2015, the City Clerk
22 determined that the initiative petitions contained sufficient signatures and presented the petitions to
23 the City Council. On November 24, 2015, the City Council adopted the initiatives without
24 submitting them to a vote by the pcople.
25 96. On February 22, 2016, Petitioners filed another petition for writ of mandate in Riverside
26 County Superior Court challenging the City Council's adoption of the development agreement by
27 initiative. The trial court denied the writ petition and entered judgment against Petitioners on
28 September 14, 2016.

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

97. Petitioners appealed. On August 23, 2018, the Court of Appeal, in a published decision,
2 reversed the Superior Court's judgment and held that a development agreement cannot be adopted
3 by initiative. Center for Community Action & Environmental Justice v. City of Moreno Valley (2018)
4 26 Cal.App.5th 689, review denied (Nov. 28, 2018). On June 12, 2019, the Superior Court issued a
5 writ of mandate directing the City to set aside its adoption of the initiative measure that purported to

6 approve the development agreement.

7 98. In February 2018, the Riverside County Superior Court issued a ruling in Petitioners' CEQA
8 action identifying deficiencies in five issuc areas in the FEIR: energy, biological resources and
9 habitat, noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. The Court denied Petitioners' challenge to the
10 FEIR's GHG analysis. In June 2018, the Court entered judgment and issued a writ of mandate
11 directing the City to set aside its certification of the FEIR and its approval of a tentative parcel map
12 for financing and conveyance purposes.

13 99. Petitioners appealed the Superior Court's denial of their challenge to the FEIR's GHG
14 analysis; the City and Highland Fairview cross-appealed from the judgment granting Petitioners'
15 claims on the five identified issues. Paulek v. Moreno Valley Community Services District (Cal. Ct.
16 App. 4th Dist., Div. 2. No. E071184) (*Paulek"). On May 15, 2020, the Court of Appeal issued a
17 tentative opinion reversing the Superior Court's judgment on the GHG issue and largely affirming
18 the Superior Court's judgment in favor of Petitioners on the other issues. Oral argument in the
19 appeal is scheduled for August 5, 2020.

20 D. The City of Moreno Valley's Subsequent Project Approval and Environmental Review
21 Process

22 1. The City's Revised Sections of the Final EIR

23 100. In July 2018, the City relcased a document entitled Revised Sections of the Final
24 Environmental Impact Report ("RSFEIR") that purported to address deficiencies identified by the
25 Riverside Superior Court in its analysis of impacts related to energy, biological resources and
26 habitat, noise, agriculture, and cumulative impacts. The RSFEIR was open for a review and public
27 comment period, which closed on September 7, 2018.

28

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 101. Numerous members of the public, including Petitioners, submitted extensive comments to

2 the City regarding the continuing severe flaws contained in the RSFEIR's analyses. Such comments

3 expressed serious concerns about the RSFEIR's failure to adequately address the deficiencies

4 identified by the Riverside Superior Court.

5 102. In particular, comments noted that the RSFEIR. continues to inadequately address the direct

6 and cumulative impacts of the Project on biological resources and habitat, including the San Jacinto

7 Wildlife Area.

8 103. Comments also cxpressed concern with the RSFIER's weakened and insufficient analysis of

9 noise impacts and mitigation and the continued failure to adequately disclose, analyze the

10 significance of, and provide adequate mitigation for the Project's significant noise impacts.

11 104. Comments additionally highlighted the RSFEIR's flawed cumulative impacts analysis.

12 105. Comments also pointed out that the RSFEIR fails to adequately address and mitigate the

13 significant agricultural impacts related to this Project and improperly defers mitigation of

14 agricultural impacts until future plans are produced related to the development of the Project.

15 2. The City's Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR

16 106. In Docember 2019, the City released a document entitled Draft Rocirculated Revised

17 Sections of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Draft Recirculated RSFEIR"). The City found

18 the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR included significant new information requiring revision and

19 recirculation of portions of the RSFEIR pursuant to Section 15088.5 of the CEQA Guidelines. The

20 sections of the RSFEIR affected by the new information in this Draft Recirculated RSFEIR were Air
21 Quality including Human Health, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Energy. These sections were

22 made available for a 45-day public review beginning on December 17, 2019 and ending on January

23 31, 2020.

24 107. With respect to GHG emissions, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR stated that if the Court of

25 Appeal were to reverse the Superior Court's judgment upholding the FEIR's GHG analysis, the City

26 would require the applicant to obtain GHG "offsets" as mitigation for the Project's emissions.

27 However, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR continued to rely on the Cap and Trade Program to

28

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 dismiss the significance of Project emissions, and it failed to include any new mitigation measures

2 requiring the purchase of GHG offsets.

3 108. As noted by public comments and agencies, including ARB and the Natural Resources

4 Agency, the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's continued reliance on the Cap and Trade Program renders

5 its analysis unlawful. Comments also pointed out that the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR apparently

6 omitted any mitigation measure that would have required the applicant to offset the Project's GHG

7 emissions in the event the Court of Appeal struck down the FEIR's reliance on the Cap and Trade

8 Program.

9 109. Comments also pointed out that the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR failed to assess the Project's
10 consistency with local climate measures, policies, and plans. For example, reliance on GHG offsets

11 instead of VMT reductions created inconsistencies with the regional transportation plan, which the
12 Revised FEIR failed to address.

13 110. Comments also expressed serious concerns about Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's failure to

14 adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant and adverse impacts to air quality and human
15 health, including the Project's potentially severe DPM and GHG emissions impacts.
16 111. Comments also identified the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR's failure to disclose transportation
17 and energy related emissions, and to meaningfully analyze requirements that would mitigate the

18 harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this project.
19 3. The City's Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the Final EIR and Druft
20 Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR

21 112. In April 2020, the City published its Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the
22 Final EIR and Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR ("Revised FEIR"). The
23 document introduced the text, for the first time, of newly proposed Mitigation Mcasurc (MM)
24 4.7.7.1, a requirement that the developer purchase "offsets and/or carbon credits," the amount of
25 which would be either the "Total Uncapped" GHG emissions or "Project Emissions" from new
26 Table 4.7-16, depending on the outcome of the appeal in Paulek. The Revised FEIR asserts that
27 with the application of all previous mitigation measures and the new Mitigation Measure 4.7.7.1, the
28

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 WLC Project's GHG emissions will be reduced to "net zero" and that they are, therefore, below the
threshold of significance.

3 113.

4 Members of the public, including petitioners, again submitted comments objecting to the
Revised FEIR's flawed analysis

5 Mitigation Measure 4.7.7.1. of impacts from GHGs and identifying numerous flaws in

6

7 4. The City's Approval of the Revised Final EIR and Statement of Overriding

8 Considerations, and its Reapproval of the Tentative Parcel Map and Development
Agreement

9 114.

10 On May 14, 2020, the City posted an Additional Errata to the Revised Final EIR, which

11 incudes, inter alia, edits to Mitigation Measure 4.4.6.3D requiring a relocation plan for burrowing
owls if relocation is necessary.

12 115.

13 On May 14 and 15, 2020, the City's Planning Commission considered and adopted

14 resolutions certifying the Revised Final EIR, approving a tentative parcel map for conveyance and

15 financing purposes, and recommending approval of a development agreement for the Project.
116. Petitioners filed timely appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions regarding the
16 tontative parccl map and the Development Agreement to the City Council.
17 [17. On June 12, 2020, the Fourth District Court of Appeal issued a published opinion,
18 invalidating a GHG mitigation measure that is functionally identical in material respects to
19 Mitigation Measure 4.7.7.1. Golden Door Properties, LLC v. County of San Diego (Cal, Ct. App, 4th
20 Dist. Div. 1 June 12, 2020)

21 .Cal.App.5th_,2020 WL 3119041 ["Golden Door Properties"]. The

22 Court of Appeal found that a San Diego County mitigation measure relying on offsets purchased
from "ARB-approved" registries violated CEQA by, among other things, failing to ensure adequate
23 standards for offsets listed by carbon registries (including offsets from international sources), and
24 improperly deferring and delegating formulation of mitigation.
25 118.

26 The City Council heard Petitioners' appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions and
held a hearing on the Development Agreement on June 16, 2020.
27 [19.

28 In preparation for the June 16, 2020 City Council hearing, the City posted, a few business
days before the a meeting, a staff report in excess of 5,000 pages that included, among other things,

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 further revisions to MM 4.7.7.1. Those revisions removed the reference to Paulek and referred to

3 Table 4.7-16 as identifying the amount of emissions to be mitigated.
120.

4 Following its June 16, 2020 hearing, by a 3-1-1 vote, the City Council denied Petitioners'

5 appeals of the Planning Commission's decisions, certified the Revised PEIR, and approved the

6 tentative parcel map. The development agreement for the Project received final approval on July 7,
2020.

7

8 V. THE CITY COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION OF THE REVISED FEIR AND

9 121. ASSOCIATED PROJECT APPROVALS VIOLATED CEQA
In May 2020, the public submitted numerous comments that included significant new

10 information about the impacts of COVID-19 on communities exposed to elevated levels of air

11 pollution. This new information necessitates a Supplemental Revised FEIR. These concerns were

12 again raised and supported by additional expert a studies in a May 26, 2020 appcal letter submitted to

13 the Planning Commission.

14 122. Commenters also noted the continuous changes in the Revised FEIR's GHG analysis and the

15 lack of opportunity for the public to comment on these changes. In particular, initially MM 4.7.7.1,

16 introduced for the first time in the Response to Comments on the Revised Sections of the Final EIR

17 and Draft Recirculated Revised Sections of the Final EIR, proposed that the Project's massive GHG

18 emissions be mitigated through "proof" of either *offsets" or "carbon credits." MM 4.7.7.1 also

19 required the City to "conclusively presume[]" that basic criteria required under the Health and Safety

20 Code are satisfied by any offset credit purchased from "a carbon registry approved by the California

21 Air Resources Board." Yet, the amount of GHGs to be mitigated was left undetermined, depending

22 on the outcome of Paulek.

23 123. To the extent MM 4.7.7.1 reflects a substitution of a "net zero" analysis for the previous

24 "capped emissions analysis," the Revised FEIR fundamentally changes how climate impacts are

25 disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated. Moreover, under any such changed analysis, enviroumental

26 impacts previously dismissed as less than significant would be considered significant under the

27 thresholds applied in the Revised FEIR; accordingly, the changes in the Revised FEIR reveal new

28

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF

1 significant impacts. The City's failure to recirculate the Revised FEIR is in violation of CEQA

2 Guidelines § 15088.5.

3 124. On June 11, 2020, the City released a document that removed the reference to Paulek in the

4 mitigation measure and referred to Table 4.7-16 as identifying the amount of emissions to be

5 mitigated. Then, on June 16, 2020, during the City Council hearing and after all opportunities for

6 public comment had closed, Petitioners are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the

7 City again modified MM 4.7.7.1.

8 125. Although the Revised FEIR proposed a new mitigation strategy in the form of MM 4.7.7.1, it

9 did not change the FEIR's underlying analysis of the significance of the Project's GHG emissions.

10 As a result, the Revised FEIR continues to rely improperly and unlawfully on the Cap and Trade

11 Program to dismiss the significance of all purportedly "covered" emissions.

12 126. The Revised FEIR must, therefore, be revised and recirculated. The EIR's approach to

13 climate impacts and mitigation now consists entirely of revisions made after the Planning

14 Commission certified the Revised FEIR, which was only three working days before the City

15 Council's hearing on an appeal of that certification. As a result, the Revised FEIR's new approach to

16 climate change impacts and mitigation has never been circulated for public review and comment as

17 CEQA requires.

18 127. In addition, and in the alternative, the changes to the Revised FEIR rendered the EIR

19 incoherent and fundamentally inadequate as an informational document. The Revised FEIR adopted

20 an entirely different mitigation strategy without changing the EIR's underlying analysis of the

21 Project's GHG emissions, which remains unlawfully grounded in a legally and factually erroneous
22 I misinterpretation of the Cap and Trade Program.

23 128. Commenters also noted that the Rcvised FEIR fails to meaningfully analyze requirements

24 that would mitigate the harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this Project. For

25 example, in response to the City of Moreno Valley's April 2020 Final Environmental Impact Report,
26 the California Attorney General and the ARB jointly submitted comments pointing out that requiring
27 zero-emission trucks for the Project is feasible and is something ARB has long recommended. In

28

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P addition, commenters raised issues around the failure to include sufficient clean energy gencration
2 such as solar power as a mitigation for emissions associated with this project.
3 i. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Impacts

4 129. MM 4.7.7.I is not fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally
5 binding instruments, in violation of CEQA Quidelines 15126.4(a). The measure provides no
6 standards for the City's Planning Official to use in determining whether such "offsets" are "real,
permanent, additional, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable" by a public agency, as required by
8 State standards. The measure also impermissibly defers and delegates mitigation in violation of
9 CEQA. Finally, the measure is inadequate and invalid under the Golden Door Properties opinion.
10 130. The public submitted comments explaining the inherent uncertainty in the success of offsets
11 and the failure of carbon credit protocols to result in one-to-one GHG reductions, ensure compliance
12 with additionality requirements, and other flaws.

13 131. Comments specifically pointed out that the offsets are not verifiable because the developer,
14 "in its sole discretion," need only submit a copy of the relevant protocol, a verification report, and a
15 copy of the serial numbers pertaining to the credits, and nothing in the measure contemplates City
16 review of the protocol for consistency with purportedly applicable standards.
17 132. Additionally, comments noted that the measure fails to provide any performance standards
18 under which the City could evaluate whether the protocol ensures credits will be consistent with
19 state standards. Contrary to the City's assertion that "net zero" is a "performance standard," "net
20 zero" is merely a generalized goal that relies too heavily on "subjective" determinations of
21 adequacy.

22 133. Comments also identified the measure's improper deferral and delegation of mitigation and
23 its lack of objective porformance standards but also becausc it addresses emissions only after they
24 have occurred.

25 134. Moreover, comments noted that MM 4.7.7.1 is not adequately enforceable. Although
26 MM 4.7.7.1 purports to require that offset credits be "enforceable," nothing in the measure provides
27 any authority for the City to hold a particular party liable and to take appropriate action if any of the
28

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELTEF

applicable regulations are violated. Additionally, the measure is not adequately enforceable because

2 nothing in MM 4.7.7.1 limits reliance on international offset projects listed by private registries.

3 135. Comments also identified the apparent limitation of the measure to 30 years, which not only

4 leaves significant Project emissions unmitigated but also jeopardizes the State's ability to meet its

5 long-term GHG emission goals.

6 136. Comments emphasized that despite the potentially significant impacts of MM 4.7.7.1, the

7 Revised FEIR fails to address these impacts in violation of CEQA Guidelines. For example,

8 although Project emissions for 2020 through 2023 would exceed the 10,000 MT CO2e threshold in

9 cach year, and thus would be significant before mitigation, the Revised FEIR fails to disclose and

10 analyze the significance of these impacts. In addition, the Revised FEIR failed to address foresceable

11 impacts of using offset credits as mitigation, an evaluation which cannot be delegated to private

12 entities.

13 137. Comments also noted that the changes in analysis and new information associated with MM

14 4.7.7.1 revealed new significant impacts and/or more severe significant impacts than were

15 previously analyzed, and that the changes rendered the Revised FEIR's analysis as a whole

16 fundamentally and basically inadequate. The City failed to recirculate the Revised FEIR in light of

17 this significant new information as CEQA requires.

18 138. Comments reitcrated that the Revised FEIR illcgally disregards transportation and cnergy

19 related emissions.

20 139. Commenters also noted the Revised FEIR fails to meaningfully analyze requirements that

21 would mitigate the harmful greenhouse gas and air quality impacts from this project, including

22 requirements for use of trucks cleaner than the current commitment of trucks meeting 2010 emission
23 standards - a standard that would allow trucks 10 years or older to enter the project in perpetuity.
24

25 Several zero-cmissions models are either available and/or will be increasingly available as this

26 project is built, including a forthcoming requirement from the ARB.

27

28

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ii. Biological impacts

2 140. Comments expressed concern for the fact that the Revised FEIR's biological impacts section

3 remains unlawful, for example, with respect to impacts on burrowing owls and other species.

4 141. Commenters expressed that the Revised FEIR failed to provide a cumulative analysis of the

5 Project's impact on biological resources. Nearby projects, including the Village of Lakeview

6 housing development that will also impact the southern portion of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, are
7 not included in the Revised FEIR's analysis in violation of CEQA.

8 142. Commenters also expressed concerns that the Revised FEIR also claims, without providing

9 substantial evidence, 250-foot development setback is adequate protection for biological resources.

10 Numerous commenters raised negative edge effects from human activity, traffic, lighting, noise,

11 pollutants, invasive weeds, and increased fire frequency, which have been found to be biologically

12 significant up to 300 meters (~1000 feet) away from anthropogenic features in terrestrial systems.
13 These negative edge effects were not fully analyzed nor mitigated in the Revised FEIR.

14 143. Commenters also expressed concerns about truck and vehicle traffic increases on Gilman

15 Springs Road and all roads adjacent to the San Jacinto Wildlife Area for both construction and

16 operation, which will increase anticipated wildlife "roadkill." Commenters critiqued the Revised

17 FEIR's failure to provide any analysis of the increase in wildlife injury and mortality that will occur

18 due to increased traffic. By failing to adequately analyze impacts from increased traffic on wildlife

19 injury and mortality, the Revised FEIR fails to also provide avoidance, minimization, and mitigation

20 measures. Under CEQA, "the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that,

21 notwithstanding project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the proposed

22 project followed meaningful consideration.

23 144. Commenters also expressed concerns over the failure to have a compliant buffer between

24 buildings at the WLC site and hunting areas south of the project arca, which violates California Fish

25 and Wildlife Code requirements.

26 ili. Noise impacts

27 145. Commenters noted that the Revised FEIR significantly weakened mitigation measures

28 designed to protect the public from noise pollution.

31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 146. Commenters noted that mitigation measure 4.12.6.2A includes options that would eliminate
2 the need to install the on-site sound barrier if a vote by those affected fails to garner 50 percent
3 favorable votes or 100 percent favorable votes for a sound barrier placed on private property. These
4 two provisions were never considered in the original noise analysis nor do they seem to be fair to the
5 community due to the speculative nature of whether a sound barrier will be used or not. In addition,
6 the developer owns properties in those locations subject to the noise impacts and is entitled to a vote
7 on sound barrier installations.

8 147. Commenters noted that this mitigation measure poses vague and unclear obligations.
9 iv. Failure as an informational document

10 148. The Revised FEIR is a complex and incoherent web, comprising two revised versions: the
11 Revised Sections of the FEIR (RSFEIR) and the Draft Recirculated RSFEIR, and additional
12 important elements added in the Response to Comments and Errata, the most recent of which
13 occurred during the final City Council hearing after the close of any further opportunity to comment.
14 Further, the Revised FEIR relies on information from an invalidated EIR that was struck down in its
15 entirety by the Riverside County Superior Court. The many versions and amendments to the EIR
16 have rendered the its overall analysis incomprehensible. The public and decision-makers have not
17 been provided with sufficient information to participate meaningfully in the process or proceed with
18 rational decision-making. The Revised FEIR fails as an informational document.
19 V. Failure to recirculate the Revised FEIR

20 149. Commenters identified numerous changes in the Revised FEIR and other significant new
21 information that revealed new significant impacts, substantial increases in the severity of significant
22 impacts, feasible mitigation measures and alternatives, and fundamental and basic inadequacies in
23 the document. In addition, the Planning Commission failed to translate Spanish testimony for
24 planning commissioners. The City failed to recirculate the Revised FEIR prior to certification as
25 required by Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 (Violations of CEQA - Failure to Comply with CEQA's requirements -Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, or 1094.5; Public Resources Section 21000 et seq.)

4 150. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in
the foregoing paragraphs.

6 151. The City has violated CEQA by certifying a legally deficient Revised FEIR and by approving
the tentative parcel map and development agreement without adequate environmental review.

8 152. Among other things, the City:

E3 A. Failed to adequately evaluate the Project's environmental impacts, and failed to
adequately respond to public comments concerning a variety of significant

12 environmental effects of the Project, including the Project's direct, indirect, and
cumulative impacts. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100(b), 21100(d), 21002.1, 21068,

13 21060.5, 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15126.2(a), 15130(a).)

14 For example:

15 i. The Revised FEIR fails to adequately address the Project's GHG

16 emissions. By outright dismissing the Project's significant GHG

17

18 emissions, which the Revised FEIR concedes will be caused by the Project

19 and which far exceed the SCAQMD's threshold levels of significance, the
Revised FEIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirement that it "make a

20 good-faith effort, based to the extent possible on scientific, and factual

21

22 data, to describe, calculate, or estimate the amount of [GHG] emissions
resulting from a project." (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4 subsection (a).)

23

24 The Revised FEIR further fails to evaluate GHG emissions by failing to

25 consider, among others,: (1) the extent to which the project may increase
or reduce GHG emissions; (2) whether emissions exceed a threshold of

26

27 significance; and (3) the extent to which the project complies with

28 regulations or requirements adopted to implement statewide, regional, or
local plans to reduce GHG emissions. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.4(b).)

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- ii. The Revised FEIR fails to

2 adequately evaluate the incremental

3 significance of the Project's increase in GHG emissions in and around the

4 City, throughout the County, the region and the State.
fii. The Revised FEIR fails to address

5 and analyze the significance of the

6 Project's traffic, public health and air quality impacts, as well as its

7 biological resources, including loss of agricultural lands, and wildlife
impacts.

8 iv.

9 The Revised FEIR fails to properly analyze the Project's impacts to

10 biological resources. Among numerous other flaws, the Revised FEIR

11 fails to adequately analyze the true scope of the Project's impacts to

12 wildlife, sensitive habitats and plant and animal species. The Revised

13 FEIR also fails to adequately address comments that raised serious

14 concerns regarding the Project's significant impacts to imperiled and/or
endangered species, such as the burrowing owl.
15

16 B. The City failed to re-circulate the Revised FEIR in light of significant new

17 information. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1.) Such significant new information includes,

18 but is not limited to, information about: the impacts of COVID-19 on communities

19 affected by heightened levels of air pollution; the substitution of a "net zero" analysis

20 for the previous "capped emissions analysis," which not only reflected a fundamental

21 change in how climate impacts are disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated, but also

22 revealed significant impacts not disclosed or analyzed in the EIR and rendered the

23 EIR as a whole fundamentally and basically inadequate; the assumption, in the staff

24 report, that detention basins will provide adequate habitat for burrowing owls; and

25 information from the California Attorney General, the ARB, and Petitioners showing

26 that a requirement for electric trucks for the project is effective and feasible.
C. The City failed to consider, discuss,
27 adopt, or analyze the effectiveness of adequate

28 mitigation measures to minimize the Project's significant and detrimental impacts, or
otherwise improperly deferred mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's

34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2

3 impacts. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1(b); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15002(a)(3)
15021(a)(1), 15126.4.) For example:

i.

Un 4.7.7.1.

ii. The Revised FEIR fails to analyze the impacts or effectiveness of MM

The Revised FEIR unlawfully relies on MM 4.7.7.1 as mitigation.
MM 4.7.7.1 fails to satisfy CEQA's requirements for mitigation

0 measures because, among other things, it is insufficiently enforceable

3 and illegally defers and delegates mitigation necessary to address the

11 iii. project's significant GHG impacts.

12 The Revised FEIR also fails to adopt or analyze the effectiveness of

13

14 iv. adequate mitigation measures to address the Project's significant
impacts to wildlife and biological resources.

15 The Revised FEIR fails to include legally sound mitigation measures

16 V. for noise impacts associated with the Project.

17 The Revised FEIR fails to include feasible mitigation measures to

18 address significant air quality and GHG impacts, including advanced

19 clean truck technologies and enhanced solar requirements.

20 D. The City failed to base its findings, including the findings made in its Statement of

21 Overriding Considerations, on substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is defined as

22 "fact[s], [] reasonable assumption[s] predicated upon fact[s], or expert opinion

23 supported by fact [which] is not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or

24 narrative, evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous, Or evidence of social or

25 economic impacts that do not contributc to, or are not caused by, physical impacts on

26 the environment." (Pub Res. Code 21080(e); CEQA Guidelines § 15384.) As

27 Petitioners and others noted in comments, the Revised FEIR fails to include adequate

28 support for its traffic assumptions, its GHG and other air emissions and air quality
assumptions, its overall impacts assessments and its statements regarding the benefits
of this Project. The conclusions reached in the Revised FEIR regarding the

35
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

significance of these and other impacts are not supported by substantial evidence in
2 the record. The City's CEQA findings are therefore unlawful and unsupported.
153. If the City and/or Does 1-20 inclusive and Real Parties in Interest, and/or Roes 21-40
4 inclusive are not enjoined from moving forward with permitting, constructing, and operating the
5 Project without an adequate Revised FEIR, and without complying with CEQA'S environmental
6 review and evidentiary requirements, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no
7 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate.
8 154. By certifying the Rovised FEIR and by approving a Statement of Overriding Considerations,
9 as well as by approving the tentative parcel map and Development Agreement in reliance on the
10 Revised FEIR and Statement of Overriding Considerations, the City and Does 1-20 inclusive have
11 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and
12 acted without substantial evidentiary support.
13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
15 155. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained in
16 the foregoing paragraphs.
17 156: Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined, Respondents
18 and Real Parties will implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with CEQA. Petitioners
19 will suffer irreparable harm by Respondents' failure to take the required steps to protect the
20 environment and Real Parties' initiation of construction of the Project. Injunctive relief is
21 appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under
22 Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 et seq. and under Public Resources Code §
23 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.
24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
25 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:
26 A. For a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the seal of this Court pursuant
27 to Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5 or in the alternative 1085, and directing the City and/or Does 1-20
28 inclusive to:

Re: California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition Challenging the Certification of the Revised Final Environmental Impact
Report for the World Logistics Center (State Clearinghouse No. 2012021045)

Dear City Clerk:

Please be advised that as required under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, the Center for Biological Diversity, Coalition for Clean Air, the Sierra Club, and the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society (collectively "Petitioners") hereby provide notice through this correspondence of their intent to file a petition under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Moreno Valley (*Respondent") and HF Properties, Sunnymead Properties, Theodore Properties Partners, 13451 Theodore LLC, HL Property Partners, and Highland Fairview (*Rcal Parties in Interest"). (See Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)
Petitioners seek to challenge the Revised Final Environmental Impact Report ("Revised FEIR") for the World Logistics Center (State Clearinghouse No. 2012021045) that was heard on June 16, 2020 by Respondent. Petitioners will file this CEQA challenge based on the Revised FEIR's failure to comply with CEQA requirements, including but not limited to the failure to adequately
disclose or accurately evaluate environmental impacts, failure to adopt all feasible mitigation
measures, adopted pursuant to improper proccdures, and the failure to adequately consider cumulatively considerable impacts. For these and other reasons, the certified Revised FEIR is procedurally and substantively defective. In addition, Petitioners seek to challenge the Project approvals that flowed from the certification of the Revised FEIR, including but not limited to, the tentative parcel map, the devclopment agreement, and other approvals.
Among other relief, Petitioners will request that the Court issue a writ of mandate to vacate the Revised FEIR certitication and to compel the recirculation and preparation of an environmental
impact report that conforms to CEQA requirements, in addition to vacating approvals relying
upon the Revised FEIR. Additionally, Petitioners will seek costs and attorney's fees. (See Cal. Civ. Pro. § 1021.5.)
