.1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondents Regents of the University of California

3 and University of California, Riverside (collectively "University" or "Respondent") of the Parking

4 Structure 1 Project, Project No. 956553 ("Project") and the related approval of a Mitigated Negative

5 Declaration (*MND").

6 2. The University violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res.

7 Code § 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among other things, the University failed to adequately

8 consider the environmental impacts associated with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required

9 environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation.

10 3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the University's

11 approvals invalid, and enjoining the University from taking steps to implement the approvals.

12 PARTIES

13 4. Petitioner University Neighborhood Association ("Petitioner") is an unincorporated

14 association, which seeks to preserve and protect the quality of life in the area around the University of

15 California, Riverside, including promoting responsible development, supporting public education, and

16 minimizing the adverse effects of development on the community. Petitioner and its members have been

17 injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy, and benefit from the

18 resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the recreational,

19 aesthetic, scientific, environmental, and economic interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The

20 interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be adversely affected by

21 Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner's and

22 Petitioner's members' injuries.

23 5. Respondent The Regents of the University of California is a public entity of the State of

24 California, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

25 6. Respondent University of California, Riverside is a public entity of the State of California, as
26 specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

27 7. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

28 Does through 10, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

1 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

2 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

3 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY
8, The approximately 7.5-acre Project site encompasses the current Parking Lot 13 located on

5 the eastern edge of the University campus, south of Big Springs Road and west of Valencia Hill Drive.

6 9. The Project would include the construction of a four-level parking structure, approximately

7 27 feet high, and 350,728 square feet with 1,079 parking spaces. The Project also would include

8 reconfiguration of a portion of the existing surface parking area, landscape and hardscape

9 improvements, new pedestrian and bicycle pathways, and other amenities.

10 10. The University prepared the MIND regarding the Project.

11 11. Among other things, the MND noted the existing Parking Lot 13 provides approximately

12 683 parking spaces and the Project would result in a total of 1,508 parking spaces, for a net increase of

13 825 parking spaces.

14 12. The MND asserted the Project is consistent with the 2005 Long Range Development Plan

15 ("LRDP"), and that the environmental analysis in the MND could "tier" from the 2005 LDRP

16 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and the 2005 LRDP Amendment 2 EIR.

17 13. The MND concluded there would not be any significant impact associated with approval

18 and implementation of the Project.

19 14. The University issued a "Notice of Intent to Adopt" the MND on December 6, 2019,

20 indicating comments regarding the MND should be submitted by January 6, 2020.

21 15. Petitioner and others submitted timely comments objecting to the MND. Comments noted,

22 among other things, concerns with impacts to community character and aesthetics, air quality, energy

23 usage, geology and soils, greenhouse gas emissions, land use and planning, noise and lighting, traffic,

24 public health and safety, and cumulative effects.

25 16. Comments also noted the failure of the University to comply with LRDP mitigation

26 requirements, as well as the inability to rely on the LRDP EIR to support the Project.

27 17. Comments noted a fair argument of significant impacts and the University's failure to

28 prepare an EIR regarding the Project's impacts.

* ~

1 18. Despite the numerous expressed concerns, and without holding any hearing regarding the

2 Project, the University's Chancellor approved the Project on January 27, 2020.
19. A Notice of Determination was filed by the University on January 31, 2020.

4 20. The parties subsequently discussed a possible resolution of the issues associated with the

5 Project, and entered into tolling agreements extending Petitioner's deadline to file until April 6, 2020.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW
7

8 21. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project
have been presented orally and in writing to the University, as required by Public Resources Code

10 Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during

11 public hearings.

12 22. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

13 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the University. A true and correct copy

14 of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

15 23. Petitioner has advised the University that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

16 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
17 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

18 24. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

19 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

20 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

21 25. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

22 mandate requiring the University to set aside its approval of the Project and the MND. In the absence

23 of such remedy, the University's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and

24 Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts

25 generated by the Project,
