INTRODUCTION 9

10 1. The State Water Project ("SWP") is an integral part of California's water storage dT1N3OJIXM 8 ISH8 1S38 JO S3O150 MV1 ZOSTO VINHO:ITVO 'HOISH3AIH 3390 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR 11 and delivery systems, It provides reliable water supply to nearly two-thirds of California's OX 1028 P.O. 12 population and to 750,000 acres of agricultural land. This lawsuit involves how the SWP will be
13 operated over the next 10 years.

14 2. To facilitate those continued operations, Respondent California Department of
15 Water Resources ("DWR") must comply with the California Endangered Species Act, Fish &

16 Game Code § 2070 et seq. (*CESA"). To comply with CESA, DWR must obtain a permit from
17 Respondent California Department of Fish and Wildlife (*CDFW") to operate the SWP. Acting
18 as lead agency, DWR prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") that evaluated the
19 SWP Long Term Operation Project ("SWP LTO Project") under the California Environmental
20 Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").'
Project would 21 3. In its November 2019 DEIR, DWR concluded that the SWP LTO
22 have no significant environmental impacts. The DEIR was supported by substantial evidence and
23 robust analysis.

24 4. In December 2019, however, the State abruptly backed away from its proposed
25 SWP LTO Project and pivoted to a new goal of no increases in SWP exports from the San
26 Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta"). DWR then submitted an

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

{

1 application for a take permit under CESA to CDFW, which proposed a project that was different

2 than the SWP LTO Project analyzed in the DEIR. In pursuing its new "no increases in SWP

3 exports" goal, the State disregarded the best available science and the substantial evidence

4 showing that increased exports could be achieved through more flexible operations informed by

5 real-time monitoring, without causing additional adverse impacts to the Delta and while fully

6

7 5. To pursue this new goal, DWR approved a new project, the Refined Alternative 2b complying with CESA.

8 Project, and certified a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") even though neither the

9 DEIR nor the FEIR analyzed the Refined Alternative 2b Project's impacts on the environment.
d71 8HO3IUM 8 LS38 1SH8 ZO976 VINHO!ITVO 3OISHBAld XOOTH HIS 'INNBAY ALISH3AINg 0688 10 Acting as a responsible agency under CEQA, CDFW relied on the FEIR to issue Incidental Take
Permit No. 2081-2019-066 ("TTP") under CESA. DWR's approval of the Refined Alternative 2b LAW OFFICES OF 870L XO8 'O'd 11

12 Project and certification of the FEIR violated CEQA, and the terms of each Contractor Plaintiffs'

13 contracts to receive water from SWP. CDFW's issuance of the ITP based on the FEIR violated

14 CEQA and CESA.

15 6. As alleged in detail below, the defects in both the procedure used to prepare the

16 FEIR, and in the analysis contained within the FEIR, are pervasive and fundamental. These

17 defects made informed decision-making and informed public participation impossible. The

18 actions violate CEQA's procedural requirements and are reviewed de novo in this court. (See,

19 Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 512, 516.) The FEIR's conclusions are

20 also not supported by substantial evidence. In short, the FEIR does not comply with either
21 CEQA's procedural or substantive mandates. Because DWR relied on the defective FEIR when it
22. approved the Refined Alternative 2b Project, that approval must be rescinded. Moreover, because & CDFW relied on that same defective FEIR when it issued the ITP, the approval of the ITP 24 similarly fails under CEQA.

25 7. As also alleged in detail below, CDFW vio lated CESA in issuing the ITP.

26 Specifically, CDFW did not adhere to CESA's requirements in imposing mitigation measures on

27 the SWP. Additionally, CDFW overreached to obtain operational control over the SWP-a
domain reserved by law to DWR. Finally, CDFW failed to explain the restrictions it imposed on
- 7- 28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT 27881.00029\33029099.4

SWP's operations, effectively regulating without notice or discussion. Such "regulation by

2 surprise," which impacts water supply reliability for the people of California, is intolerable.

3 CESA dictates standards that must be met and boundaries that must be respected for CDFW to

4 lawfully impose restrictions on the SWP. Because CDFW did not comply with these standards,

5 the ITP approval must be rescinded for further consideration in compliance with CESA. As will

6 be demonstrated, CDFW committed pervasive and fundamental errors in issuing the ITP and in

7 implementing CESA's substantive requirements. These defects are subject to de-novo review in

8 this court. (Environmental Protection Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire

9
HOOT3 HLG 'ENN3AV ALISHJAINN 06E8 Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 478.) CDFW's decision to issue the is ITP is also not supported
EST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 10 by its findings and the findings themselves are not supported by substantial evidence. Because
dO SBOHHO MVT ZOSZE VINHOJITVE 3GISHEAlH P.O. BOX 1028 11 the ITP violates CESA, it must be rescinded.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs are already suffering and will continue to suffer irreparable harm

2 because of the Refined Alternative 2b Project's approval and ITP's issuance.

3 25. SWC, by and through its members, and Contractor Plaintiffs have a direct and

4 beneficial interest in DWR and CDFW's legally adequate compliance with CEQA, CESA, and all

5 other applicable laws in approving and implementing the Refined Alternative 2b Project and the

6 ITP. SWC and KCWA submitted multiple objections on CEQA, CESA, and other grounds to

7 DWR before March 27, 2020, when DWR approved the Refined Alternative 2b Project. Further,

8 SWC submitted objections (on its and its members' behalf) on CEQA, CESA, and other grounds

9 to CDFW's proposed reliance on the FEIR as a responsible agency and proposed approval of the

10 BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP dO SHOIHO MV ZOSZ6 VINHOdITVO 'JOISHEAIS HOO1 HIS 'ANNJAV ALISg3AING 06E8 ITP before March 27, 2020, when, according to CDFW's Notice of Determination, CDFW made

11 8ZOl X08'0'd its CEQA and CESA findings and approved the ITP.

12 26. The adverse environmental impacts of DWR and CDFW's illegal actions will

13 directly and substantially affect SWC, by and through its members, including Contractor

14 Plaintiffs. SWC, Contractor Plaintiffs, and SWC's other members rely upon water exported from

15 the Delta. Accordingly, any action, including the Refined Alternative 2b Project and the ITP, that

16 impacts the availability and reliability of that water supply is one in which SWC, Contractor

17 Plaintiffs and SWC's other members have a beneficial interest. Further, because Contractor

18 Plaintiffs rely upon SWP water as an important part of their respective water supply portfolios,

19 DWR's illegal actions, which limit the availability and reliability of Contractor Plaintiffs'

20 respective water supplies, directly and substantially affect Contractor Plaintiffs' contractual

21 rights.

22 27. Through this action, Petitioners and Plaintiffs seek to promote and enforce CEQA

23 and CESA's purposes, which are defeated by the challenged approvals.

24 28. CEQA's purposes include full disclosure of environmental impacts, informed

25 public participation, and informed decision-making. Here, DWR and CDFW's approvals were

26 made without complete and accurate information, in violation of CEQA. Ascertaining the true

27 facts about the environmental impacts of projects, disclosing those true facts to decision-makers

29. The zone of interests that CESA was intended to protect includes ensuring that the
impacts of taking of endangered species and threatened species are minimized and fully mitigated
in a manner that is (1) proportional to the impact of the taking of the species and (2) possible to
be implemented utilizing methods of mitigation that maintain the applicant's objectives to the

7 greatest extent possible. Contractor Plaintiffs and SWC's other members receive water from the
SWP. As a result, SWC, Contractor Plaintiffs, and SWC's other members have invested

9 significant resources in developing Delta science and achieving collaborative management of the

10 SWP. The ITP directly and adversely affects the investment of those resources and impairs
overall management of the SWP.

P.O. BOX 1028 11 conduct their own consultation in evaluating the long-term operations® of the CVP and SWP

12 including take of federally listed species or impact to critical habitat that may occur incidental to

13 such operations. Ultimately, USFWS and NMFS issue bio logical opinions under the federal ESA

an "incidental take statement" that is included as

16 part of the biological opinion.

17 Given the possibility that species may be dual-listed, CESA contemplates that

18 there may often be regulatory overlap with the federal ESA with respect to the measures for

19 protecting certain species, like three of the species here--the Delta smelt, the winter-run Chinook

20 salmon, and the spring-run Chinook salmon.) Specifically, CDFW may authorize the taking of a

21 listed species under CESA if it determines that the incidental take statement of USFWS and/or

22 NMFS "is consistent with" the requirements of CESA. (Fish and Game Code § 2080.1, sub. (c).)

23 Commonly referred to as a "Consistency Determination," this approach encourages collaboration

24 amongst the various wildlife agencies, both federal and state, to avoid unnecessary conflicts or

incidental take permit under CESA is not required.

1 in this Petition, CDFW had always addressed the three dual-listed species through Consistency

5 winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon (among other species). To provide CESA

6 authorization, CDFW adopted a Consistency Determination for those dual-listed species, with

State Water Project Long-Term Operations Project 18

One month later, in November 2019, DWR released the DEIR for public review. 19

20 The DEIR analyzed impacts from the SWP LTO Project. Operation of the SWP LTO Project was 50.

21 similar to project operations identified in the final version of the 2019 BA, which was transmitted

22 0n January 31, 2019. The public comment period for the DEIR ran from November 21, 2019 to

23 January 6, 2020.

24 51. In a section titled "Summary of Proposed Project," the DEIR states that the SWP

25 LTO Project would "consist of multiple elements that are expected to characterize future

26 operations of SWP facilities, would modify ongoing programs being implemented as part of SWP

on these special-status species to improve the 27 operations, would improve specific activities to enhance protection of special-status fish species,

requirements." (DEIR, 1-5.)

52.

8 The SWP LTO Project's objective, as identified in the DEIR, is "to continue the

9 long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and

10 agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water in accordance with DWR's

LAW OFFICES OF BEST BES & KRIEGER LLP BOX 1028 3390 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 11 existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full

1.)

12

13 while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific information." (DEIR, 3-

53.

14

15 The DEIR analyzed the SWP LTO Project's indirect effects on hydrology as well

16 as direct effects on surface water quality, aquatic biological resources, tribal cultural resources,

17 cumulative impacts and growth-inducing impacts, and concluded that the SWP LTO Project

54.

18 would not result in any significant impacts. (E.g., DEIR, 4-289; 4-292; 4-308; 4-320; 4-326.)

19 Despite the fact that the SWP LTO Project would have no significant impacts on

20 the environment, the DEIR analyzed a No Project Alternative, as well as "Alternative 2a-

21 Proposed Project with Additional Spring Delta Outflow"; "Alternative 2B [sic]-Proposed Project

22 with Dedicated Water for Delta Outflow from SWP"; "Alternative 3-Installation of Physical and

23 non-physical Barriers"; and "Alternative 4-alternative Summer-Fall Action" (DEIR, 5-1 through

24 5-134.) The DEIR stated that the impacts of the "proposed project [the SWP LTO Project] and

25 Alternative 2b are essentially equivalent" with neither having any significant impacts; thus, the

26 DEIR considered both "the proposed project [the SWP LTO Project] and Alternative 2b . . . to be
the environmentally superior alternatives." (DEIR 5-135.)

55.

27

28 Notwithstanding the fact that one of the DEIR's goals is "to deliver water pursuant
to water contracts and agreements up to full contract quantities" (DEIR, 3-1), DWR issued a press
release concurrently with the DEIR's circulation that contradicts this stated goal. In conflict with

27881.00029\33029099.4 the DEIR, the press release states that DWR "does not seek to increase SWP exports."

DWR's CESA Application

2 56.

3 In December 2019-one month after releasing the DEIR-DWR submitted its
application for an incidental take permit under CESA ("CESA Application") to CDFW. Under

5 CEQA, a project's objectives are critically important because any mitigation measures imposed to

6 protect listed species must maintain the project objectives "to the greatest extent possible." Here,

7 DWR's CESA Application describes the objectives of the project proposed in the application as
continuing "the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual
obligations, and agreements. DWR proposed to store, divert, and convey water in accordance

10 with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up

dO SEO1HHO MVI 0688 NIVERSITY AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR 9

BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 to full contract quantities. DWR's objectives are to optimize water supply and improve

BOX 1028 P.O. 11

12 operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific
information." (CESA Application, 3-1.)

13 57.

14 The proposed project in DWR's CESA Application departed from the project

15 proposed in the BA and the DEIR in meaningful ways. For example, the CESA Application for

16 the first time included additional outflow above what was included in the BiOps and DEIR. One

new

17 measure requires 100,000 acre feet of summer outflow from the SWP, even though the SWP

18 has not been shown to cause any take or impacts in the summer. Another requires April-May

19 export cuts in below-normal, above normal and wet years, with reductions in exports up to

20 approximately 405,000 acre-feet in some years. (FEIR, Table 5.3-1.) These additional measures
to reduce SWP water deliveries foreshadowed even further restrictive measures that CDFW

21 would demand later in the process.

22 58.

23 At some point between drafting the DEIR and submitting the CESA Application,

24 the state abruptly backed away from the project proposed in the DEIR-the SWP LTO Project-

25 and switched to a new goal of seeking no increases in SWP exports as compared to the 2008-2009
bio logical opinions.

SWC's January 6, 2020 comment letter and KCWA's January 13, 2020, comment letter. In these
5 comment letters, SWC and KCWA noted that the project proposed in the CESA Application
6 differed materially from the SWP LTO Project analyzed in the DEIR.

7 60. The new "no increased exports" goal resulted in the creation of an entirely new

8 project, which DWR identified as "Refined Alternative 26" in the FEIR. The FEIR states that

9 under the Refined Alternative 2b Project, the "total volume of exports would generally be

12 Project and Alternative 2B7 identified in the DEIR, as well as from the project identified in
S38 1S38 13 DWR's CESA Application. The Refined Alternative 2b is materially different than the SWP

14 LTO Project analyzed in the DEIR, as Alternative 2b added operational criteria that had not been

15 disclosed or evaluated previously, including new winter-run Chinook salmon and spring-run

16 Chinook salmon daily loss triggers for export reductions; new winter-run Chinook salmon export

17 reduction triggers in November and December; and in the summer-fall period, a dry-year Suisun

18 Marsh Salinity Control Gate operation.

19 62. The FEIR ignores the fact that the Refined Alternative 2b Project is materially
20 different from anything analyzed in the DEIR and instead minimizes those differences by

21 claiming that the FEIR merely "refines" the information that was in the DEIR. But the reality is
22 that the Refined Alternative 2b Project is a new project that was not analyzed in the DEIR and
23 was not made available for public review and comment. Indeed, pages 5-39 through 5-285 of
24 FEIR appear to be entirely new information about the new Refined Alternative 2b Project. The

3 63. Despite the addition of new appendices and hundreds of pages in the FEIR, the
4 FEIR does not adequately analyze and mitigate for the Refined Alternative 2b Project's

5 potentially significant impacts. The FEIR for example, did not fully model the Refined
6 Alternative 2b Project. In fact, the FEIR failed to model a myriad of scenarios that could lead to

7 reasonably foreseeable significant impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to,

8 impacts related to use of Oroville facilities to store water that CDFW is carrying over to a

In addition to the significant new information regarding the Refined Alternative 2b 15 64.

17 Project analyzed in the DEIR. The FEIR modifies the project's objective by adding a new project

19 underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain incidental take authorization from

20 the . . . [DFW]" in order to continue operating the SWP. (FEIR, 3-1.) The FEIR thus changes

21 the primary objective of the project from continuing long term operation of the SWP to obtaining

22 a take permit. This is significant new information that was never circulated for public comment.
& 65. The FEIR also includes significant new information regarding the environmentally
24 superior alternative. As discussed above, the DEIR concluded that the SWP LTO Project and
25 Alternative 2B (also referred to in the DEIR as 2b) were both the environmentally superior
26 alternatives. In contrast, the FEIR concludes that the Refined Alternative 2b Project-which the
27 FEIR states would result in no increase in Delta exportsis the environmentally superior
28 alternative. (FEIR, 5-349-350.) The FEIR continues that the "major environmental benefits
27881.00029\33029099.4 25 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

associated with" the Refined Alternative 2b Project "include the curtailment of exports by up to

2 150 thousand acre feet (TAF) in Above Normal, Below Normal, and Dry water years to maintain

3 the current SWP spring outflow contribution and provide an adaptively-managed 100 TAF bock

4 of Delta outflow in June through November of Wet and Above Normal water years . . . ." (FEIR

5 3-349-350.)

6 66. According to DWR's Notice of Determination, which OPR posted on March 30,

7 2020, DWR approved the Refined Alternative 2b Project on March 27, 2020. According to

8 DWR's Notice of Determination: (1) DWR concluded that the Refined Alternative 2b Project

9 would not have any significant impacts on the environment; (2) DWR did not adopt a mitigation,

10 monitoring and reporting program; (3) DWR did not make mitigation a condition of approval;
10 SHO1HHO MV HOOTH HIS 'INNEAY ALISUJAINN O6C€ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 8701 XO8 'O'd 11 and (4) DWR did adopt CEQA findings.

12 67. While DWR was preparing the FEIR in February 2020, Reclamation was taking

13 action on the federal BiOps. On February 19, 2020, Reclamation signed the Record of Decision,

14 thereby formally adopting the BiOps.

15 CDFW's Issuance of the CESA Incidental Take Permit and CEQA Action

16 68. CDFW departed from its prior approach of adopting Consistency Determinations

17 for the three dual listed species by issuing the ITP in March 2020 for all four of the Covered

18 Species over which it had jurisdiction-Delta smelt, Longfin smelt, winter-run Chinook salmon

19 and spring-run Chinook salmon. On April 1, 2020, OPR posted CDFW's Notice of
20 Determination. According to CDFW's Notice of Determination, CDFW approved the Refined

21 Alternative 2b Project and ITP on March 27, 2020, the very same date that that DWR approved

22 the Refined Alternative 2b Project and certified the FEIR. CDFW's Notice of Determination also

23 states that: (1) CDFW concluded that the ITP would not have any significant impacts on the

24 environment; (2) CDFW imposed "additional" mitigation measures as a condition of approval;

25 (3) CDFW approved a mitigation monitoring and reporting program; and (4) CDFW made CEQA

26 findings as a responsible agency. In its CEQA findingsand despite CEQA's requirement that

27 "mitigation" have a nexus to an environmental impact and be roughly proportionate to that impact

28 (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4, subd. (a)(4))-CDFW did not identify any significant
27881.00029\33029099.4 26 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- environmental impacts that the mitigation measures were intended to minimize. Instead, CDFW

2 asserted that the CEQA findings were not required and were only informational. However, the

3 CEQA findings are misleading and not supported by substant ial evidence in the record.

4 69. As part of the ITP, CDFW fundamentally changed SWP operations and imposed a

5 number of additional restrictions on the SWP that had not been included anywhere previously-

6 not in the BA, not in the DEIR or FEIR, not in the CESA Application and not even in the federal

7 BiOps. This rogue alteration of the SWP long term operations and invention of new mitigation

8 can only be described as an agency exerting its will to achieve an outcome regardless of what the

9 law or science dictates.

10 70. Specifically, the ITP issued by CDFW and accepted by DWR violates CESA by
LAW OFFICES OF HOOT HIS 'ENNBAY ALISUJAINN OBEE d71 8303I8X 8 1S39 1938 TOSTS VINHO:IITVO ECISH3AId P.O. 3OX 1028 11 including mitigation and other measures that, among other things:

12 are unnecessary, disproportionate and/or infeasible to address potential

13 environmental and species impacts associated with operation of the SWP;

14 are not supported substantial evidence and/or the best available science;

15 are premised on an incorrect definition of "take" of threatened or endangered

16 species;

17 are inconsistent with the project objectives described in the incidental take

18 permit application; and

19 include mitigation for take or other actions by third parties.

20 71. CDFW arbitrarily and capriciously abused its discretion by issuing the ITP with
21 unilateral modifications to the project itself, and with the imposition of additional mitigation
22 measures that are not grounded in CESA. Abandoning the prior project descriptions, the ITP
23 refashions the project and includes mitigation measures that are purportedly designed to address
24 impacts to the Covered Species. Notably, the project differs from the proposed project evaluated
25 in both the DEIR and FEIR, and the ITP imposes additional mitigation measures that were not

26 analyzed or disclosed in the CEQA review. Such additional mitigation measures include, but are

27 not limited to, unilaterally imposing CDFW's own approach to the Delta smelt salvage

28 calculation limit and corresponding OMR restrictions (ITP at 85-86) and requiring the
27881.00029\33029099.4 27
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 appointment of a Designated Biologist who possesses extraordinary broad powers over the SWP

2 operations, and who alone can immediately stop any operational activity that does not comply

3 with the ITP (ITP at 52-53).

4 72. As a practical matter, CDFW's changes to the project and imposition of unjustified

5 additional mitigation measures present serious problems. To achieve compliance and enjoy

6 protection under the federal ESA and CESA, DWR is required to comply with the conditions in

7 both the federal BiOps and the ITP. Yet there are immediately apparent inconsistencies between

8 the federal and state authorizations that cannot be reconciled. For example, the ITP prohibits

9 DWR from coordinating CVP and SWP operations without regard to DWR's obligations under
10 the federal permits or the COA.

73. dO SHOIdJO MV HO01 HIG 'INNEAV ALISHIAINN OBES d71 83028X 8 1838 1$38 3aIsH3Ay ZOSZO VINHOAITVS 11 Nonetheless, CDFW stated in no uncertain terms that if there were any 8701 X08'0'd 12 inconsistencies between the federal BiOps and the ITP, the ITP controls. (ITP, Condition of
13 Approval #3 ['For purposes of this ITP, where the terms and conditions in the federal

14 authorization are less protective of the Covered Species or otherwise conflict with this ITP, the

15 conditions of approval set forth in this ITP shall control.]".)

16 74. Adding to the errors committed, CDFW also concurrently issued CESA

17 "Findings" with the ITP. In its CESA Findings, CDFW states that with the additional mitigation
18 imposed in the ITP, the impacts to the Covered Species are fully mitigated. Notably, CDFW also

19 issued CEQA Findings. In its CEQA findings, CDFW concurs with DWR's FEIR (which found
20 10 significant impacts), but CDFW also discusses significant additional mitigation imposed in the

21 ITP that it asserts is "to ensure that any potential Project-related impact on the species and its
22 habitat arising from the ITP Covered Activities is avoided or reduced below a level of

23 significance." (CESA Findings at 9.) In short, CDFW repeatedly states that, but for inclusion of
24 the ITP's new mitigation measures, a wide array of impacts would have been significant. This is

25 patently inconsistent with the FEIR.

3 Code Civ. Proc. 8§ 1085 and 1094.5 - Violation of CEQA)

4 (By all Petitioners and Plaintiffs Against DWR and DOES 1-100)

5 75. Petitioners and Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference each previous paragraph

6 of this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

7 76. "[T]he legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford

8 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

9 language." (City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015)
d'T1 HHO3IXX 8 1S38 1S38 61 Cal.4th 945, 963, internal punctuation and citation omitted.) When complying with CEQA, a
LAW OFFICES OF BOX 1028 YOO15 HLS 'IANBAY ALISHEAINN 0B8E ZOGT6 VINHOJITYO '3OISSEAlS 10

11 lead agency must proceed in the manner required by law, and its determinations must be

12 supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5.)

13 77. The defects in the FEIR are peryasive and fundamental, so much so that they make
14 informed decision-making and informed public participation impossible. DWR's certification of

15 the FEIR thus constitute procedural violation of CEQA and the FEIR is reviewed de novo in

16 this court. (See, Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 512, 516.) The FEIR's

17 defects and CEQA violations include, but are not limited to the following:

18 Inconsistent and Shifting Project Description

19 78. A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA's

20 mandate. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative

21 and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,

22 193.) DWR violated this fundamental mandate because the project description was not stable

23 throughout the administrative process and because the project that DWR ultimately approved was

24 not adequately analyzed in the FEIR.

25 79. The project identified and analyzed in the DEIR is the SWP LTO Project.

26 However, the project that DWR ultimately approved, the Refined Alternative 2b Project, is

27 materially different than the SWP LTO Project analyzed in the DEIR, as set forth above. The

28 Refined Alternative 2b Project is also materially different than any of the alternatives identified in
27381.00029\33029099.4 29 .
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2

3 the DEIR. Similarly, the project described in DWR's CESA Application is materially different

4 than both the SWP LTO Project analyzed in the DEIR and the Refined Alternative 2b Project that

5 DWR ultimately approved. This shifting and unstable project description precluded public

6 review and informed decision-making, and prevented meaningful analysis of the environmental
impacts of the Refined Alternative 2b Project.

7 80. Inconsistent and Shifting Project Objectives

8

ALISHHAINN 06€E A VENUE, 5TH FLOOR The FEIR also modifies the project's objectives by adding a new objective that

BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP ZOSZ6 VINHO:I1VO 3aIs3Ald 10 was not included in the DEIR: "The underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain
incidental take authorization from the.

LAW OFFICES OF P.O. BOX 1028 11 [CDFW]" in order to continue the SWP LTO. (FEIR,

12 3-1.) The FEIR thus changes the primary objective of the project from continuing long term

13 operation of the SWP to obtaining a take permit. But a regulatory permit is what allows an

14 agency to implement a proposed project, the permit is not the project itself. This switch

15 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because scient ific data does not support that switch,

16 and because it evidences that DWR's primary purpose was improperly focused on obtaining one

17 particular regulatory approval rather than on developing operational parameters for the SWP's
long term operations.

81.

18

19 Again, DWR's use of inconsistent project descriptions in the DEIR and FEIR and

20 changes in project objectives prevented informed public comment and informed decision-making

21 and precluded the FEIR from functioning as an informational document as CEQA requires.
DWR's use of inconsistent project descriptions and switch in project objectives is a procedural
violation of CEQA.

22

23

24 Refined Alternative 2b Project Is Inconsistent with
the Project Objectives Identified in the Draft Environmental Impact Report

82.

25

26 Even as to those objectives that were included in the DEIR, DWR fails to explain

27 how the Refined Alternative 2b Project is consistent. Specifically, the DEIR states that one of the

28 SWP LTO Project's objectives is to "convey water in accordance with DWR's existing water
rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full contract quantities."
(DEIR, 3-1, emphasis added.) The Refined Alternative 2b Project that DWR approved is
27881.00029\33029099.4 30 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 inconsistent with this stated objective because it is premised on no increases over existing

2 baseline exports.

3 83. Evidence included in the DEIR demonstrates that additional water quantities above

4 the existing SWP baseline could be exported without resulting in any significant impacts to the

5 Delta and the listed species. However, DWR disregarded this evidence and instead approved the
increases from the 6 Refined Alternative 2b Project, which DWR touts will not result in any export

7 Delta above existing baseline. (FEIR, 5-349-350.) The Refined Alternative 2b Project is thus

8 inconsistent with the objective identified in the DEIR to supply up to full contract quantities.

9 84. DWR adopted the Refined Alternative 2b Project even though it is inconsistent
BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP WO0T5 HLS 'INNJAY ALISSIAINN 068€ 10 with the DEIR's stated project objectives. This violates CEQA, precludes informed public
HO S30IH0 MV1 ZOST6 VINJONITVO 'HGISHEAIS 11 P.O. 8ZOL XOE comment and informed decision-making, and constitutes a procedural violation of CEQA's

12 mandate that an environmental impact report must be an informational document.

13 Failure to Exercise Independent Judgment

14 85. In addition to the defects resulting from the shifting and inconsistent project

15 description and objectives, Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe that neither CDFW

16 nor DWR had any intention of allowing any increase in export quantities notwithstanding the

17 DEIR's stated objective.

18 86. Specifically, DWR embraced an abrupt switch from a substantial evidence and

19 science-based analysis to a "no increased exports" goal as evidenced by DWR's press release and

20 approval of the Refined Alternative 2b Project. Because this materially different project was only

21 developed after the DEIR was circulated for public review, the environmental impacts of the

22 Refined Alternative 2b Project were never made available for public review and, worse, are

23 insufficiently analyzed in the FEIR in a manner unsupported by substantial evidence.

24 87. Further, this switch demonstrates that DWR did not exercise its independent

25 judgment in approving the Refined Alternative 2b Project and in certifying the FEIR. Instead,

26 DWR's stated intent (expressed after DWR released the DEIR) not to allow any increased exports

27 demonstrates that it pre-determined and pre-judged the outcome of the process, in violation of

28 CEQA's procedural mandate.

5 DWR failed to comply with CEQA's requirement that the lead agency must

8 impacts. Further, the "analysis" in the FEIR regarding the Refined Alternative 2b Project's
potentially significant impacts is wholly inadequate.

89.

d11 3O3IEN 8 1S38 1S: 10

LAW OFFICES OF 3390 UNIVERSIT AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 For instance, the FEIR fails as an informational document with regard to the

P.O. BOX 1028 11 analysis of impacts that are more fundamental to the purpose of the project-the ability to

12 continue long term operation of the SWP and to cont inue providing reliable water supply to

13 millions of Californians. DWR did not fully model the Refined Alternative 2b Project. In fact,

14 the FEIR failed to model a myriad of scenarios that could lead to significant impacts on the

15 environment, including impacts related to use of Oroville facilities to store water that CDFW is

16 carrying over to a subsequent year; and daily salvage limits for winter run and spring-run

17 Chinook salmon. The Refined Alternative 2b Project could also have significant impacts to water
supply and the FEIR fails to analyze those impacts.

90.

18

19 DWR's failure to analyze potentially significant impacts from the Refined

20 Alternative 2b Project precluded informed decision-making and informed public comment and
thus vio lates CEQA's procedural requirements.

21 91.

22 Failure to Recirculate Draft Environmental Impact Report

23 CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5 requires lead agency to recirculate an

24 environmental impact report when, as here, "significant new information" is added to the FEIR

25 after the DEIR is released to the public but before the FEIR is certified. Here, the FEIR

26 effectively presents a wholly new project that was not included in the DEIR-the Refined

27 Alternative 2b Project-based on a new fundamental objective to obtain a CESA permit and a
new pre-determined outcome of avoiding any increases in exports.

92.

28 The FEIR purports to simply "refine" the DEIR's Alternative 2B (also referred to

27881.00029\33029099.4 as 2b in the DEIR). But the reality is that the Refined Alternative 2b Project is a new project that
32 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

was not in the DEIR and not made available for public comment. Pages 5-39 through 5-285 of

2 the FEIR appear to be entirely new information about this new project. The FEIR also includes

3 two brand new technical appendices (J and K); substantial revisions to four other technical

4 appendices (C, E, F, and H); and provides a dozen new technical reports/modeling outcomes that

5 were never circulated for public review. Thus, even if this expansive, new information did fully

6 analyze the Refined Alternative 2b Project (and it does not), all of that new material constitutes

7 significant new information triggering the requirement to recirculate the DEIR under CEQA.

8 DWR was required to recirculate the DEIR to allow the public to comment on this new project;

9

d'T1 8IO3IAM 8 1S38 1S38 10 93. The FEIR also includes significant new information regarding the project
LAW OFFICES OF HOO1 HIS 'ENNHAY ALISHRAINN O6EE this is particularly true given that DWR ultimately approved that new project.
ZOSZE VINJO!ITVO 'EGISHHAId P.O. 8ZOL XOE 11 objectives, as set forth above. Specifically, the FEIR modifies the SWP LTO Project's objective

12 by adding a new purpose as follows: "The underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain

13 incidental take authorization from the .. . [DFW]" in order to continue the SWP LTO. (FEIR, 3-

14 1.) The FEIR thus changes the primary objective of the Project from continuing the SWP LTO to

15 obtaining a regulatory take permit. This, too, is significant new information that was never

16 circulated for public comment.

17 94. DWR's failure to recirculate the DEIR despite this significant new information

18 precluded informed public comment and informed decision-making. This is a procedural

19 violation of CEQA's requirements.

20 Inadequate Response to Comments
21 95. CEQA Guidelines section 15088 requires a lead agency to make a good faith,

22 reasoned analysis in response to comments provided during the public comment period. DWR's
23 responses to comments, however, are cursory, conclusory, and factually unsupported.
24 96. For example, SWC, KCWA and other public agencies commented that DWR was
25 not utilizing a consistent project description in the DEIR and the CESA Application. SWC,

26 KCWA and others commented that CEQA required DWR to utilized a consistent project

27 description and requested DWR to either approve the project identified in the DEIR (the SWP
28 LTO Project) or recirculate the DEIR to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the new

27881.00029\33029099.4 33 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 project that DWR proposed in the CESA Application. DWR glossed over the significant changes

2 in the project description by describing them as a mere "refinement" to the SWP LTO Project

3 identified in the DEIR. DWR provided similarly conclusory responses to numerous other

4 comments, and thus prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to respond to comments in good

5 faith and to support those responses with substantial evidence.

6 No Substantial Evidence to Support Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report or

7 Approval of Refined Alternative 2h Project

8 97. It is axiomatic under CEQA that an environmental impact report must contain
ALISHJAINO 06EE AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR substantial evidence to support its conclusions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code

AW OFFICES OF d'71 8HO3IEM 8 1S38 1$38 92502 INHO!ITVO '3OISS3AIS 10 § 21168.5)

11 98.
BZ0L XO8 '0'd As set forth herein, there is no substantial evidence to support DWR's certification

12 of the FEIR O1 approval of the Refined Alternative 2b Project. The FEIR lacks a consistent

13 project description, is based on shifting project objectives, fails to include adequate analysis of

14 the Refined Alternative 2b Project, and includes significant new information requiring

15 recirculation. Although the FEIR cites to certain "expert opinion," those opinions do not

16 constitute substantial evidence because they are speculative, erroneous, and factually

17 unsupported. (See CEQA Guidelines § 15384 [the opinion of "experts" only constitutes

18 substantial evidence where that opinion is not speculation, accurate, and supported by facts].)

19 Given these defects, the record simply does not contain substantial evidence to support DWR's
20 certification of the FEIR or approval of the Refined Alternative 26 Project.

21 Inadequate CEQA Findings

22 99. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support a lead agency's findings

23 regarding potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence

24 to the findings must be provided. (CEQA Guidelines § 15091.)

25 100. Although DWR's CEQA findings have not been made readily available to the

26 public, DWR's Notice of Detormination states that CEQA findings were made.

27 101. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the

28 findings are legally inadequate and/or unsupported by substantial evidence.
27881.00029\33029099.4 34 -

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

102. Further, and even if DWR did not identify any significant environmental impacts

2 requiring written CEQA findings, Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that

3 basis allege that the findings are misleading or contradictory in a manner that misleads the

4 decision-makers and public.
Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion 5

6 103. The inadequacies alleged above are prejudicial and require DWR's approval of the

7 Refined Alternative 2b Project and certification of the FEIR to be revoked. DWR's actions

8 constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion because DWR failed to proceed in a manner required

9 by law. (Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5.)

16 105. All "persons," including state agencies such as CDFW, are prohibited from taking

18 Game Code § 2080, 2081; Kern County Water Agency v. Watershed Enforcers (2010) 185

20 address particular impacts on a species "shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of

21 the authorized taking on the species," "shall maintain the [project] applicant's objectives to the

22 greatest extent possible," and "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game

23 Code § 2081.)

24 106. The defects in the ITP are pervasive and fundamental. CDFW prejudicially

25 abused its discretion by (1) imposing conditions in the ITP that violate CESA; (2) issuing a

26 decision unsupported by the Director's factual findings; and (3) making factual findings not

27 supported by the evidence. (Environmental Protection Information Center v. California Dept. of

2 violations of CESA include, but are not limited to the following:

3 Improper Definition of "Take"

4 107. Under the Fish & Game Code, "take" "means hunt, pursue, catch, or kill, or

5 attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture or kill." (Fish & Game Code § 86.) Habitat is not within

6 the definition of "take." (Environmental Council of Sacramento v. City of Sacramento, 142

7 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1040 (2006) ["We reject any insinuation that the definition of 'take' under

8 Fish and Game Code section 2081 subdivision (b)(2) encompasses habitat alone"]; 94 Ops Cal.

10 species or threated species by way of habitat modification."].)
dO SHOIJHO MV BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 108. 870L XOS P.O. 11 CDFW attempts to characterize habitat modification as "impacts of the authorized
12 take" that must be fully mitigated under Fish & Game Code § 2081 and California Code of

13 Regulations tit le 14, section 783.4, subdivision (a)(2). For example, the ITP states at page 44:
14 "Impacts of the authorized taking also include adverse impacts to covered species related to
15 temporal losses, increased habitat fragmentation, reduction in habitat extent and quality, and
16 increased edge effects and the Project's incremental contribution to cumulative impacts (indirect

17 effects)."

18 109. Similarly, in the CESA Findings, CDFW asserts that project-related disturbance of
19 covered species habitat are expected to result in incidental take of those species and that "adverse

20 changes to habitat characteristics that certain covered species rely on, is an appropriate and

21 necessary indicator of the extent of incidental take at issue." (CESA Findings, 6-7.)

22 110. Relatedly, the ITP impermissibly uses habitat as a basis for imposing mitigation.
23 To stretch this even further, CDFW considers the potential enhancement of habitat for predators

24 as the rationale for imposing considerable restrictions on the SWP. (ITP at 44-49.) In its Effects

25 Analysis, CDFW discusses how mortality may be increased by biotic stressors (such as predators)
26 on Covered Species in the South Delta. (ITP Attachment 7, at 50, 61; ITP Attachment 8 at 19,
27 35.) Entrainment in the South Delta and subsequent mortality due to a less favorable habitat is
28 not take like mortality due to entrainment into SWP facilities, but CDFW appears to treat these as
27881.00029\33029099.4 36 -

1 equal for purposes of mitigation. In another transparent example, CDFW explains that Condition

2 of Approval 8.17, increasing outflow through reductions in spring exports at the SWP,

3 "improve[es] habitat for Delta and [LJongfin smelt," whereas "[r]eductions in outflow . . . could

4 restrict longfin smelt nursery habitat upstream." (ITP at 104.) Seemingly recognizing that this

5 exceeds its authority under CESA, CDFW describes this a as a "proactive approach to entrainment

6 minimization." (ITP at 104.)

7 111. A plain reading of CDFW's ITP and the related CESA Findings reveals that

8 CDFW is improperly using habitat modification as a proxy for species mortality. This runs afoul

9 of CESA by impermissibly considering habitat modification itself to be a "taking."

112. dO LAW OFFICES RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 11 Under CESA, CDFW "shall maintain the applicant's objectives to the greatest BOX 1028 P.O. 12 extent possible" when selecting among mitigation measures. (Fish & Game Code § 2081, subd.

13 (b)(2).)

14 113. DWR explains in its CESA Application that "[t]he objective of the Proposed

15 Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws,

water contracts and 16 contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water in

17 accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to

18 agreements up to full contract quantities. DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve

19 operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific

20 information." (CESA Application, 3-1; see also DEIR, 3.1.1.)

21 114. CDFW makes a conclusory finding that required mitigation maintains DWR's

22 objectives to the greatest extent possible but provides no analysis to support that statement.

23 (CESA Findings, 43.) The ITP does not even mention DWR's objectives. Moreover, CDFW ran

24 afoul of the CESA mitigation standards because CDFW did not maintain DWR's objectives "to
the fullest extent possible" when selecting among available mitigation measures. Conditions in
the ITP, including but not limited to, conditions requiring additional export flow restrictions not 25

1 Disproportionate Mitigation

2 115. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of

3 an authorized taking "shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the authorized

4 taking on the species." (Fish & Game Code § 2081, subd. (b)(2).)

5 116. CDFW improperly imposed minimization and mitigation measures that are vastly

6 disproportionate to the alleged impacts of the incidental take authorized under the ITP. For

7 example, DWR explained in its CESA Application that modeling and data showed the proposed
8 project, which does not even include several aspects of the mitigation proposed in the CESA

9 Application, is expected to result in impacts consistent with the impacts under existing conditions.

10 These conditions were already determined to be fully mitigated under the CDFW's prior CESA
LAW OFFICES OF BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP HOO1 HLS 'ENNBAY ALISHBAINN 06C€ ZOSZG VINHO!ITVO 'H0ISH3AIS 870L XOS P.O. 11 permits and Consistency Determinations (E.g. CESA Application, 4-4, 4-49 to 4-51, 4-69, 4-76 to
12 4-78). CDFW nonetheless imposed new minimization, mitigation and monitoring requirements
13 in the ITP well above and beyond the conditions in prior authorizationsthese new requirements

export 14 are projected to cost approximately $170 million and require significant additional SWP
15 restrictions. CDFW fails to tie this extensive mitigation to the SWP operation's alleged impacts
16 on the Covered Species. Some mitigation is clearly not associated with any taking impacts of the
17 SWP operations, including but not limited to, ITP conditions requiring additional export
18 reductions in April and May that were born from restrictions imposed in the past for the benefit of
19 Central Valley steelhead. (FEIR, Part III at 5-6, 5-38.) The Central Valley Steelhead is not a
20 CESA listed species.

21 117. Compounding CDFW's error in failing to explain how the ITP measures mitigate
22 for alleged impacts from SWP operations, it is evident that much of the mitigation is

23 impermissibly based on impacts caused by other water users. For example, the ITP also requires

24 DWR to provide $20 million for a winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon rearing habitat to

25 address any increased impacts from the 2019 NMFS BiOps. (CESA Findings, 51, 57.) CDFW

26 explains that "[r]estoring juvenile rearing habitat is intended to increase habitat diversity and

27 complexity, which can lead to population resiliency during times of increased temperatures and
28 water demands." (CESA Findings, 51-52, 57). But, "Sacramento River temperatures are

1 artificially maintained through cold water releases in the summer from Shasta Reservoir [which is

2 managed by Reclamation] in order to provide adequate spawning and rearing habitat

3 downstream." (ITP Attachment 8 Effects Analysis, 15-16.) Thus, any impacts based on

4 temperature are a result of CVP operations, not SWP. As another example, the ITP imposes

5 limitations on exports based on salvage rates of Covered Species at both the CVP and SVP

6 salvage facilities. (E.g. ITP at 81, 86, 89.) In particular, the ITP requires SWP to restrict exports

7 for seven consecutive days based on cumulative salvage of juvenile Delta smelt at CVP and SWP

8 facilities. (ITP at 85-86.) In other words, even if the loss occurs only at the federal CVP

9 facilities, the SWP would still be required to reduce SWP water diversions as identified in these H0O7 HILG 'INNEAY ALISHBAIN 06E8 10 conditions.

14 proportional to a landowner's impact on a species means that the landowner is required to

15 mitigate only its own impacts on the species"].)
Infeasible Mitigation 16

17 118. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of

18 an authorized taking "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game Code

19 § 2081, subd. (b)(2).) CDFW issued the ITP with conditions that are not capable of successful
other water 20 implementation, including, but not limited to, conditions that require DWR to prevent

21 diverters from diverting water withheld from SWP exports. For example, under ITP Conditions

22 8.18 and 8.19, DWR is required to ensure that no other water diverters divert water that DWR

23 reserved from export for the purpose of augmenting Delta outflow. (ITP at 105-108.) Because

24 CVP and SWP can be subjected to different operational criteria for OMR flows and export

25 restrictions under the separate state ITP and federal ESA permits (see Condition of Approval

26 8.10, ITP at 96), implementation of operational criteria is no longer coordinated and any water

27 not exported by DWR through the SWP may result in increased exports to the CVP rather than as

28 Delta outflow. If the SWP lowers exports to the minimum of 600 cubic feet per second for health

2 and safety, the SWP still will not, in certain circumstances, be able to meet the outflow reductions

4 that the CVP and the SWP may be operated under differing operational criteria, but

5 simultaneously imposes operational criteria "that assume coordination by [DWR] and

6 Reclamation." (Condition of Approval 8.10, ITP at 96.) CDFW provides no explanation as to

7 how DWR and Reclamation are expected to coordinate to meet operational criteria under the ITP

8 and simultaneously meet the differing operational criteria under the federal ESA approvals.

LAW OFFICE: : OF ACISHEAIg CALIFORNIA 92502 10

BOX 1028 P.O. 11 119.

12 There is a division of labor between CDFW and DWR. On the one hand, under

13 CESA, CDFW is charged with protection of threatened and endangered species. (Fish & Game
Code

14 2050 et seq.) On the other hand, DWR is responsible for various duties and

15 responsibilities regarding the administration of water resources in the State, including "full charge
and control" of the SWP. (Water Code §§ 11451, 11260.)

16 120.

17 The ITP runs afoul of this statutory division by providing CDFW with unfettered

18 discretion to make SWP operational decisions. For example, the ITP requires the appointment of

a

19 Designated Biologist with extraordinarily broad powers who can immediately stop any activity

20 that does not comply with the ITP. (ITP at 52-53.) Similarly, under ITP Condition 8.1.4, if the

21 water operations management team cannot reach a resolution on an operational recommendation,

22 "the CDFW Director may require Permittee to implement an operational recommendation

23 provided by CDFW. CDFW will provide its operational decision to Permittee in writing.

24 Permittee shall implement the operational decision required by CDFW." (ITP at 71.) CDFW

25 does not establish parameters within which DWR must operate-rather, CDFW takes over

26 operational decisions for itself. By including such provisions in the ITP, CDFW is acting beyond

27 its statutory authority and has given itself the power to operate the SWP.

2 Inadequate CESA Findings

3 121. CDFW's CESA Findings are inadequate, misleading, contradictory, and
unsupported by substantial evidence. Contrary to law, CDFW failed to rely on the best scientific

5 information in making its findings and issuing the ITP. (Fish & Game Code § 2081, subd. (c).)

6 Instead, CDFW relied on conclusory statements and repeatedly failed to acknowledge the

7 scientific uncertainty in its assumptions. For example, DWR made clear in the FEIR (which

8 CDFW it relied on) that it "does not agree that the 'Kimmerer regression' is the best available
science or that any decisions should be made based on the 'Kimmerer regressions." (FEIR

BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 10

LAW OFFICES OF 870| XC HOO1 HLG 'ENNEAY ALISHBAINN 068€ RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 Appendix E, E2-1.) Nevertheless, CDFW relied on that modeling in the Effects Analysis. (ITP

11 Attachment 7 Effects Analysis, 69, 75, 84.)

122.

12 Additionally, when examining whether the mitigation is roughly proportional to

13 the impact of the authorized taking in its CESA Findings, CDFW makes no attempt to reconcile

14 relatively small impacts with substantial mitigation measures. (CESA Findings, 41-42.) CDFW

15 does not explain how the extent of mitigation is proportional to the extent of the impacts of the

16 authorized taking. (CESA Findings, 41-42.)

17 123. Unjustified Mitigation Lacking Necessary Public Review

18 public CEQA and CESA impose an obligation on CDFW to provide an opportunity to the

19 to review and comment on conditions of the ITP adopted by CDFW, when such conditions

20 were not proposed in the CESA Application. CDFW is required to issue an incidental take permit

21 in compliance with CEQA and relies on the CEQA public review process in processing its

22 incidental take permits. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, §§ 783.3, 783.5.) Under CDFW's CESA

23 regulations, as responsible agency, it had three options when making a decision on the CESA

24 Application: (1) proceed with an action under Public Resources Code section 15096, subdivision

25 (e); (2) approve the permit and make findings; or (3) deny the permit and provide a written

26 statement to the applicant of the basis for that denial including "a description of any measures the

27 Director deems necessary in order for the application to be approved." (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14,

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 129. The defects in the FEIR are pervasive and fundamental, so much so that they make

2 informed decision-making and informed public participation impossible. CDFW's reliance on

3 the defective FEIR as a responsible agency to issue the ITP, along with CDFW's approval of a

4 project that was not analyzed in the FEIR, constitute procedural violations of CEQA subject to de

5 1OVO review in this court. CDFW's CEQA violations include, but are not limited to the

6 following:

7 Inconsistent Project Description

8 130. A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA's

9 mandate. (Washoe Meadows Community v. Department of Parks and Recreation (2017) 17

10 Cal.App.5th 277.) As set forth above in greater detail, the FEIR violates this fundamental
g d118393IHN 8 1S38 1SJE 11 mandate because the project description was not stable throughout the administrative process and
LAW OFFICES 8007H HLS 'INNZAY ALISHIAING 06€8 92502 N8O:I7VO '30ISHJAl8 P.O. BOX 102 12 because neither the Refined Alternative 2b Project nor the project that CDFW approved in the

13 ITP were analyzed in the FEIR. The project identified and analyzed in the DEIR is the SWP LTO

14 Project. However, the project described and approved in the ITP is materially different than the

15 LTO Project, the alternatives identified in the DEIR, and the Refined Alternative 2b Project. The

16 project approved by CDFW via the ITP was not analyzed in the FEIR. Essentially, the project

17 that CDFW approved has not been subject to any CEQA review at all.

18 131. The project descriptions in the DEIR, CESA Application, FEIR and ITP are all

19 materially different. This inconsistency in describing the project prevented informed public

20 comment and informed decision-making and rendered the FEIR insufficient as an informational

21 document. As such, CDFW's reliance on the FEIR as a responsible agency to issue the ITP is a

22 procedural violation of CEQA.

23 Failure to Exercise Independent Judgment

24 132. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe that CDFW insisted on DWR's

25 abrupt switch from an approach based on science and substantial evidence to one that improperly

26 focused on "no increase in exports." As such, Petitioners and Plaintiffs assert that CDFW pre-

27 determined that the ITP would not allow any additional exports from the Delta, regardless of what

28 science and the CEQA analysis showed.
27881.00029\33029099.4 43 •
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 133. Given this, CDFW did not exercise its independent judgment in reviewing the
certified FEIR as a responsible agency and issuing the ITP based on that FEIR. CDFW's
approval of the ITP was pre-determined, in violation of CEQA's procedural mandate.
4 Project Approved in Incidental Take Permit Is Inconsistent with the Project Objectives

5 Identified in the Draft Environmental Impact Report

6 134. The DEIR states that one of the SWP LTO Project's objectives is to "convey water

7 in accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and

8 agreements up to full contract quantities." (DEIR, 3-1.) The project approved in the ITP IS

9 inconsistent with this stated objective.

10 135. Evidence demonstrates that additional quantities of water above the existing SWP
dO $EO1HO MVT HOO15 HLG 'IANJAY ALISHJAINN OBEE BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA 92502 870l XO8'O'd 11 baseline could be exported without resulting in any significant impacts to the Delta. The

12 modified project that CDFW approved in the ITP will not allow any export increases. As such,
13 the project approved in the ITP is inconsistent with the DEIR's project objective.
14 136. CDFW's approval of the ITP, even though it is inconsistent with the project
15 objectives identified in the DEIR, violates CEQA, precludes informed public comment and
16 informed decision-making, and constitutes a procedural violation of CEQA.

17 Failure to Analyze and Mitigate the Incidental Take Permit Project's
18 Significant Impacts on the Environment

19 137. CDFW violated CEQA by relying on a defective FEIR for all the reasons
20 identified above. Further, and as explained above, the Refined Alternative 2b Project first

21 appeared in the FEIR, so the DEIR necessarily did not analyze Refined Alternative 2b's
22 potentially significant impacts. As also explained above, the FEIR did not adequately analyze or
23 mitigate the Refined Alternative 2b Project's impacts. As a result of this, the FEIR is inadequate
24 and CDFW could not rely on it to approve the ITP.
25 138. It is well-established that public agencies, including CEQA responsible agencies,
26 are not permitted to approve projects until after the completion of adequate CEQA review.

27 (RiverWatch v. Olivenhain Muni. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186 [striking down
28 responsible agency's approval where it preceded CEQA review].) CDFW committed a
27881.00029\33029099.4 44

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

procedural violation by approving a project in the ITP that was not identified or analyzed in the

2 FEIR at all. The project in the ITP is materially different than the Refined Alternative 2b Project.

3 Changes imposed through the ITP include (but are not limited to) modifications in Longfin smelt

4 OMR criteria, Delta smelt salvage calculations and export reductions, limits on CVP use of SWP

5 facilities when the two projects are not operating to the same OMR, compensatory mitigation and

6 funding in perpetuity for management of habitat. These changes, and the potential significant

7 impacts arising from them, were never analyzed in any CEQA document.

8 139. In approving a project in the ITP despite the fact that its potentially significant

9 impacts were never analyzed in any CEQA document, CDFW abused its discretion and violated
BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 10 CEQA's procedural mandates.

HO SHOIJO MVI ZOSZ6 VINHO:ITVO '3GISHBAIS HOO1 HLS '3ANJAY ALISHSAiN 068€ 8ZO1 XO8 'O'd 11 No Substantial Evidence to Support Approval of Incidental Take Permit

12 140. The conclusions presented in an environmental impact report must be supported by

13 substantial evidence. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5.) As alleged in

14 detail above, there is nO substantial evidence to support the FEIR's conclusions. As such, CDFW

15 could not rely on the FEIR to approve the ITP.

16 141. Further, because the project approved in the ITP was not analyzed in any CEQA

17 document, there is no substantial evidence to support CDFW's approval of the ITP.
Improper Imposition of Mitigation Measures 18

19 142. Mitigation measures are only required to minimize a project's significant
20 environmental impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126, subd. (e).) Mitigation for impacts that are

21 less than significant is not required. (Ibid.) Further, there must be a nexus and proportionality

22 between the mitigation measure imposed and the identified significant impact on the

23 environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4, subd. (a)(4.) Finally, any mitigation must be

24 "feasible," or "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period

25 of time." (CEQA Guidelines § 15364.)

26 143. Here, CDFW adopted CEQA findings and issued a Notice of Determination

27 stating that CDFW had imposed mitigation (via the ITP) to reduce significant impacts under

28 CEQA. (E.g., CDFW's CEQA Findings, 25, 26, 30, 33, 34, 37; CDFW's Notice of
45
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT 27881.00029\33029099.4

1 Determination.) Further, CDFW adopted a mitigation monitoring and reporting program

2 specifically under CEQA as part of its CEQA findings. Yet, neither the FEIR nor the ITP

3 characterize the severity of any potential impacts as significant. Therefore, CDFW's imposition

4 of mitigation measures in the absence of any identified significant impacts is a prejudicial abuse

5 of discretion, because it lacks any nexus to any identified impacts under CEQA.

6 144. Further, given that neither the FEIR nor the ITP identify any potentially significant
impacts that would result from the Refined Alternative 2b Project or the project approved in the
ITP, there is no nexus between the mitigation measures and the alleged significant impacts that
the measures are intended to minimize.

10 145. In addition, because neither the FEIR nor the ITP identify any potentially BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP HO SHOIHHO MVI 8O011 HLS 'INNBAY ALISUJAINN 06€€ 30ISH3AI8 ZOSZ6 VINHOJITVO 870L XO8O'd 11 significant impacts that would result from the Refined Alternative 2b Project or the project

12 approved in the ITP, there is no proportionality between the mitigation measures and the alleged

13 significant impacts that the measures are intended to minimize.

14 146. Separate from its ITP conditions under CESA, CDFW's mitigation measures

15 under CEQA exceed CDFW's legal authority for the same reasons as set forth above, and,

16 therefore, are legally infeasible in violation of CEQA.

17 147. Similarly, ITP Condition 8.1.4, which states that "the CDFW Director may require
18 Permittee to implement an operational recommendation provided by CDFW," is expressly
19 referenced and imposed as a CEQA mitigation measure through CDFW's CEQA findings. (E.g.,
20 CDFW's CEQA Findings, 10, 11, 14, 17.)

21 148. Because it lacks the legal authority to impose such conditions for all the reasons
22 identified above, CDFW's attempted imposition of those same conditions as CEQA mitigation
23 mcasures is legally infeasible and fails as a matter of law.

24 CEQA Findings that Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

25 149. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support a responsible agency's findings
26 regarding potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence

27 to the findings must be provided. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15096.)

28

27881.00029\33029099.4 46 -
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 150. Although neither the FEIR nor the ITP identified any significant impacts, CDFW

2 nonetheless adopted CEQA findings, purportedly to further CEQA's informational purposes.

3 (CDFW's CEQA Findings, 4, 5.) The findings, however, are based on the legally inadequate
4 FEIR and dependent on a shifting project description and project objectives, and are therefore not

5 supported by substantial evidence.

6 151. Further, and even if CDFW did not identify any significant environmental impacts

7 requiring written CEQA findings, the findings are affirmatively misleading and contradictory.

8 This is because the findings are based upon a FEIR that did not actually analyze the project

9 approved in the ITP. CDFW's CEQA findings are replete with references to the FEIR and
d718303%X 8 1S29 1S38 10 statements purporting that the FEIR analyzed impacts from the project approved in the ITP.

12 decision-makers as well as the public for whom the findings were allegedly an "information

13 disclosure" tool, in a manner constituting prejudicial abuse of discretion.

14 Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion

15 152. As alleged above, CDFW abused its discretion in numerous ways, such as by

16 relying on a procedurally and substantively flawed FEIR, by imposing CEQA mitigation for

17 unidentified impacts, for adopting misleading and contradictory findings, and for approving a

18 project that has not yet undergone adequate CEQA review.

19 153. The inadequacies alleged above are prejudicial and require CDFW's CEQA

20 actions and its approval of the ITP to be rescinde until full environmental review in compliance

21 with CEQA is conducted. CDFW's actions constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because

22 it failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and because its conclusions are not supported by

23 substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5.)

5 convey water. A true and correct copy of KCWA's long-term contract with DWR is attached

6 hereto as Exhibit 2.8 Each Contractor Plaintiff's state water supply contract includes identical or

7 substantially identical terms as are contained in Articles 16 and 38 in KCWA's long-term

8 contract, which are alleged to have been breached by DWR, as alleged herein. Contractor

from the SWP.

LAW OFFICES OF BOX 1028 3390 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, 5TH FLOOR ZOSZ6 VINHO ITVO EdISH3ArE 11 156. SGVMWD executed its

12 long-term contract with DWR in 1962. CCWA, acting

13 through the County of Santa Barbara Flood Control District, DRWD, KCWA, PWD, SCVWA,

14 and TLBWSD executed their respective long-term contracts with DWR in 1963, OFWD executed

15 its long-term contract with DWR in 1965, and County of Kings executed its initial long-term

16 contract with DWR in 1967. Each of the Contractor Plaintiffs' respective initial contracts have a

17 term of 75 years. Some of the Contractor Plaintiffs have executed various amendments to their

18 respective State Water Contracts with DWR, including identical amendments to each of those

19 contracts which extend the term of the contracts to the later of (1) the project repayment period,

20 (2) 75 years [from the respective date of the respective contracts], or (3) the period ending with

21 the latest maturity date of any bond issue used to finance the construction costs of project

22 facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, the allegations contained herein are based on provisions

23 that remain effective and are identical or substantially identical in the Contractor Plaintiffs' State
Water Contracts.'

25

26 $ Exhibit 2 includes KCWA's original SWP contract, and all amendments.

27 ° The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, another State Water Contractor, executed the first State Water Contract in 1960, which required that the basic terms and

28 conditions of all later contracts, including those of KCWA and TLBWSD, be substantially uniform. Consequently, Contractor Plaintiffs' respective contracts contain substantially similar terms and conditions.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

L 157. Under the Contractor Plaintiffs' respective State Water Contracts, based on the

2 most recent charges to the Contractor Plaintiffs, KCWA pays roughly 23.6% of all supply-related

3 and 6.7% of all transportation-related SWP costs; AVEK pays roughly 3.5% of all supply-related

4 and 3.4% of all transportation-related SWP costs; CCWA pays roughly 4.3% of all supply-related

5 and transportation-related SWP costs, in total; DRWD pays roughly 0.99% of all supply-related

6 and 0.22% of all transportation-related SWP costs; County of Kings pays roughly 0.25% of all

7 supply-related and a portion of all transportation-related SWP costs; OFWD pays roughly 0.14%

8 of all supply-related and transportation-related SWP costs, in total; PWD pays roughly 0.51% of

9 all supply-related and 0.65% of all transportation-related SWP costs; SCVWA pays roughly
d118OBIUN 8 1S38 ISJS 2.28% of all supply-related and roughly 2.5% of all transportation-related SWP costs; SGVWD
LAW OFFICES OF HOOT HIS 'INNBAY ALISSHAINN 0688 . 92502 INHO:ITVO '30ISH3AIH 10

P.O. 870 L XOE 11 pays roughly 0.69% of all supply-related and 0.98% of all transportation-related SWP costs; and

12 TLBWSD pays roughly 2.1% of all supply-related and a portion of all transportation-related SWP

13 costs. The supply and transportation costs are assessed to and collected from Contractor Plaintiffs

14 through Statement of Charges DWR issues on an annual basis. Individual Contractor Plaintiffs

15 have paid more in transportation costs at various points in time, based on individual commitments

16 and agreements to assist in funding various SWP transportation infrastructure projects.

17 158. Contractor Plaintiffs have done all of the things that are required of them by the

18 terms and conditions of their respective State Water Contracts, and remain ready, able, and

19 willing to meet their respective obligations and complete their performance under their respective

20 State Water Contracts.

21 159. Pursuant to Article 6 of Contractor Plaintiffs' State Water Contracts, Contractor

22 Plaintiffs have the right to receive an allocated share of available (non-surplus) SWP water, up to

23 a maximum of the below AFY amounts. This is referred to as "Table A" water:

d0 $30ldd0 MVI HOOT HILS 'ENNJAY ALISUBAINN 068E ZOST6 VINHOHITVE EaISHEAly Article 16(b) of each Contractor Plaintiff's State Water Contract requires DWR to

P.O. BOX 1028 11 "make all reasonable efforts to perfect and protect water rights necessary for the system and for

12 the satisfaction of water supply commitments under this contract."

13 161. Furthermore, although a DWR has a certain amount of discretion in how it operates

14 and manages the SWP, Article 38 of cach Contractor Plaintiff's State Water Contracts requires

15 that DWR do so in a manner that is not "arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable."

16 162. DWR failed to fulfill its contract obligations by agreeing to mitigation in excess of

17 that required by law. Even though DWR determined that the SWP LTO Project in its Draft EIR

18 did not have any significant environmental impacts, it added new project alternatives to its Draft

19 EIR that included new high water-cost actions. DWR further proposed an even higher water cost

20 alternative in its CESA Application. Thereafter, DWR proposed and agreed to Refined

reductions and 21 Alternative 2b, an even higher cost alternative, including further water export

22 mitigation. The additional and new water export reductions and outflow mitigation actions

23 contained in Refined Alternative 2b as approved by DWR are mcasures that are not required in

24 order for DWR to comply with the law and thereby violate DWR's contractual obligations to

25 "make all reasonable efforts to perfect and protect water rights necessary for the System and for

26 the satisfaction of water supply commitments" under the State Water Contracts, and not to take

27 actions that are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable in its management and operation of the

28 SWP.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 163.

2 DWR further breached its contractual obligations under the terms of the contracts

3 with each of the Contractor Plaintiffs by accepting an incidental take permit for the long-term

4 operations of the SWP that vio lated or was otherwise inconsistent with the law. Specifically,

5 DWR accepted an incidental take permit that is inconsistent with CESA because it includes

6 mitigation measures and other measures that, among other things:

7 are unnecessary, disproportionate, and/or infeasible to address potential

8 environmental and species impacts associated with long-term operation of the

SWP;

BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 80OT: HLS '3NNEAV ALISHBAING 06€8 9

10 are not supported by substantial evidence and/or the best available science;

LAW OFFICES OF ZOS76 VINXO:ITVO 'JOISHJAIS P.O. 870l X0g 11 are premised on an incorrect definition of "take" of threatened or endangered
species under CESA:

12

13 were not subjected to the appropriate amount of or an adequate environmental

14 review, in violation of CEQA; and

15 improperly include mitigation for take by third parties or other actions by third
parties.

16 164.

17 As a result, Contractor Plaintiffs will receive significantly less Table A water and

18 will be forced to pay significantly more in unwarranted water supply-related charges than they

19 otherwise would, had DWR not proposed or agreed to the improper conditions included in the

ITP.

20 165.

21 Beyond these breaches, DWR also agreed to cede control over certain future

22 operations of the SWP to CDFW under the guise of real-time operations when it approved

23 Refined Alternative 2b. Pursuant to Water Code section 11451, DWR must retain "full charge

24 and control of the construction, operation, and maintenance of the [SWP]."

166.

25 By delegating such operational decision making to CDFW, DWR violated Water

26 Code section 11451, and by doing so breached its obligations under Articles 16(b) and 38 of the
State Water Contracts for this additional reason.

27 167.

28 DWR's failures to comply with Articles 16(b) and 38 of the Contractor Plaintiffs'
respective State Water Contracts constitute material breaches of the State Water Contracts which

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing)

this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

169. Contractor Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference each previous paragraph of

13 Contractor Plaintiffs have done all of the things required of them by the terms and

14 conditions of their respective State Water Contracts with DWR, and remain ready, able, and
willing to meet their respective obligations and complete their performance under their respective
State Water Contracts.

15 171.

16

17 DWR has unfairly interfered with Contractor Plaintiffs' rights to receive the full

18 benefits of their State Water Contracts by agreeing to and approving mitigation in excess of what

19 is required by law, and by accepting an incidental take permit for long-term operations of the
SWP that violated or was otherwise inconsistent with the law, as alleged morc specifically in the
paragraphs above.

20 172.

6 State Water Contracts;

7 5. For costs of suit;

8 6. For attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

contractors! obligations authorized by this subdivision are made
available exclusively for the benefit of agricultural use on land
other than excess land and are not directly or indirectly made
available for the benefit of agricultural use on excess land.
For the purpose of this contract, the surcharge credit
shall be determined and applied In the followlng manner:
(1) The Agency or any retail agency shall reduce the
toll for each acre-foot of projeat water put to agricultural use
on other than excess land by a surcharge credit which shall be

tolls charged for project water put to use on excess land by an
amount equal to the sum of the surcharge and the surcharge credit,
and the Agency agrees not to take any action with respect to the
taxing or assessment of property which will nullify or tend to
nullify the differential in tolls required by this subdivision.
(3) In the event that a water user commingles project

water with water from other sources or receives a commingled

water supply from the Agency on a retail agency that has commingled
project water with water from another source, the quantity of
water upon which the surcharge credit is to be determined shall be
the product of the amount of water used by the water user from the
commingled supply and the ratio of the amount of project water in
the commingled supply to the total amount of commingled water, from
which product shall be subtracted the amount of project water, if
any, for which the water user is required to make payment of a
surcharge under the provisions of Article 30(e)(2) of this contract.

3. Subdivision (c) of Article 12 is amended to read

as follows:
(c) Limit on Rate of Delivery to Agency
In no event shall the State be obligated to deliver
water to the Agency through all delivery structures at a total
combined instantaneous rate of flow exceeding three thousand two
hundred seventy seven (3,277) cubic feet per second, except as
this rate of flow may be revised by amendment of this article after

AR 012120

submission to the State of the Agency's requests with respect to
maximum flow capacities to be provided in said delivery structures,
pursuant to Article 10.

4. Subdivision (a) of Article 16 is amended to read
as follows:

(a) Limit on Total of all Maximum Annual Entitlements
The Agency's maximum annual entitlement hereunder,
together with the maximum annual entitlements of all other con-

tractors, shall aggregate no more than the minimum project yield
as defined herein and in no event more than 4,230,000 acre-feet
of project water.

5. Subdivision (c) of Article 45 is amended to read

as follows:

(c) Surplus Water
Notwithstanding other provisions of this contract,
surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenishment use
shall be offered to contractors on the following basis, Before

surplus water is sold for other than agricultural and ground water
replenishment use, each contractor shall have the right, subject
to the ability of the State to deliver such water and to the
provisions of the next succeeding paragraph, to contract for
agricultural and ground water replenishment use for a portion of

the total amount of surplus water available in any year, in an
amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of surplus
water available in that year as the sum of the annual entitlements
set forth in Table A of this contract, delivered to the contractor

for agricultural and ground water replenishment use during the
preceding three years bears to the total amount of such annual

- 5-

AR 012121

entitlements delivered for agricultural and ground water replenish-
ment use during the preceding three years of all contractors
requesting surplus water: Provided, That if its proportion of
such surplus water is not required by or cannot be delivered to
any contractor, such amount of additional surplus water shall be
offered to other contractors for agricultural and ground water
replenishment use. During the first three years in which project

water is delivered to a contractor, the State shall determine the

amount of surplus water which the contractor may obtain based on
the contractor's maximum annual entitlement and the estimated
percentage of its annual entitlement to be delivered for agri-
cultural and ground water replenishment use; but quantities SO
determined shall not exceed the contractor's annual entitlement

for that year. For the purpose of computing the portion of the
surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenishment
use to which each contractor is entitled, the State shall determine
the amounts of water used for agricultural and ground water replen-
ishment use by each contractor in each year: Provi.ded, That each
contractor shall furnish certified copies of such records and data
concerning the use of water within its boundaries as the State

may request.

The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable
only to contractors in the San Joaquin Valley Service Area,

contractors in the Southern California Service Area, and contractors

in the Central Coastal Service Area. Before surplus water is sold
for other than agricultural and ground water replenishment use,
each contractor shall have the right, subject to the ability
of the State to deliver such water, to contract for agricultural

- 6-

AR 012122

and ground water replenishment use in accordance with the following
formula: contractors in the San Joaquin Valley Service Area sha 11
have a right to contract for sixty-nine percent (69%) of the
surplus water available a1 the Mile 18 Pumping Plant; contractors
in the Southern California Service Area shall have a right to
contract for twenty-nine percent (29%) of such water; and
contractors in the Central Coastal Service Area shall have a right
to contract for two percent (2%) of such water: Provided, That

within each of these service areas, each contractor shall have
the right to contract for agricultural and ground water replenish-
ment use for a portion of the total amount of surplus water
available to that service area in any year, in an amount which
bears the same ratio to the total amount of surplus water
available to the service area in that year as the sum of the annual
entitlements, set forth in Table A of this contract, delivered to
the contractor for agricultural and ground water replenishment use
during the preceding three years bears to the total amount of such
annual entitlements delivered for agricultural and ground water
replenishment use during the preceding three years of all contrac-
tors in that service area requesting surplus water: Provided,
further, That if its proportion of such surplus water is not
required by ox cannot be delivered to any contractor, such amount
of additional surplus water shall be offered to other contractors
for agricultural and ground water replenishment use. During the
first three years in which project water is delivered to a contrac-
tor, the State shall determine the amount of surplus water which
the contractor may obtain based on the contractor's maximun annual
entitlement and the estimated percentage of its annual entitlement

-7-

AR 012123

to be delivered for agricultural and ground water replenishment
use; but quantities so determined shall not exceed the contractor's
annual entitlement for that year. As used in this paragraph,
"contractors in the San Joaquin Service Area' shall mean: Devil's
Den Water District, Dudley Ridge Water District, Empire West Side
Irrigation District, Hacienda Water District, Kern County Water
Agency, and Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District; "contractors
in the Southern California Service Area" shal1 mean: Antelope
Valley-East Kern Water Agency, City of West Covina, Coachella
Valley County Water District, Crestline-Lake Arrowhead Water
Agency, Desert Water Agency, Littlerock Creek Irrigation
District, Mojave Water Agency, Palmdale Irrigation District,
San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, San Gabriel Valley
Municipal Water District, San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency, The
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Upper Santa
Clara Valley Water Agency, and Ventura County Flood Control

District; "contractors in the Central Coastal Service Area" shal1

mean: San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation
District and Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conser-
vation District.

The provision of this paragraph shall be applicable only
to a contractor to which the delivery of project water for munici-
pal use as of 1990 is estimated by the State to be in excess of
fifty percent (50%) of such contractor's maximum annual entitlement.
For the purpose of fixing such contractor's right to delivery of
surplus water, water from a watershed not tributary to the

• 8-

AR 012124

Contracton's area which is delivered within the contractor's
boundaries for agricultural or ground water replenishment use
sha11 be deemed to be part of the contractor's annual entitlement
delivered for such use in computing the quantity of surplus water
to which the contractor is entitled under this subdivision:
Provided, That the contractor shall not be deemed to have used
more than its annual entitlement, as set forth in Table A, for

such use. Surplus water shall be deemed to be used by the con-
tractor for agricultural or ground water replenishment use if an
equal quantity of water imported from a watershed not tributary
to the contractor's area is delivered within the contractor's
boundaries for such use.

In providing for the delivery of surplus water to
contractors pursuant to this subdivision, the State shall refuse
to deliver such surplus water to any contractor to the extent that

the State determines that such delivery would tend to encourage
the development of an economy within the area served by such con-
tractor which would be dependent upon the sustained delivery of
water in excess of the contractor's maximum annual entitlement,
In no event shall the quantity of surplus water made available in
any year prior to 1986 to any contractor under this subdivision
exceed the difference between its annual entitlement for that year
and its maximum annual entitlement, except that, subject to
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to
any contractor which under Table A of its contract is scheduled
to receive its maximum annual entitlement prior to 1978, che

-9-

AR 012125

quantity of surplus water made available in any year prior to 1986
under this subdivision may exceed such difference by not more than
3,000 acre-feet.
Surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenish-
ment use shall be furnished at prices which will return to the
State the variable operation, naintenance, power, and replacement
components of the Delta Water Charge and Transportation Charge
incurred in such service of surplus water as determined by the
State. Surplus water delivered under this subdivision shall be
limited to the quantity of water which can be delivered without
adversely affecting the reliability, or increasing the cost, of
service to meet annual entitlements. A surcharge shall be added
to the rate for suzplus water furnished to excess land in an amount
and under the conditions specified in Article 30 of this contract.
Contracts made pursuant to this subdivision may exceed one year
in duration,

Except as herein modified, the provisions of Article 21
of this contract are hereby confirmed, and all surplus water not
specifically allocated pursuant to this subdivision shall be sold
under the provisions of Article 21. Nothing in this subdivision
shall limit the right of the Agency to increase its annual entitle-
ments as otherwise provided in this contract.
As used in this subdivision "ground water replenishment
use" shall mean the use of project water exclusively by direct
application to spreading basins, streambeds, or through other
means of direct artificial recharge for the purpose of replenish-
ing overdrawn ground water basins.

6. Within thirty (30) days of the date of execution of
this amendment, the Agency shall submit this amendment to a court
of competent jurisdiction for determination of its validity by a

proceeding in mandamus or other appropriate proceeding or action,
which proceeding or action shall be diligently prosecuted to final
decree or judgment,

AMENDMENT TO WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY

THIS CONTRACT, made this 31st day of December, 1968,
pursuant to the provisions of the California Water Resources
Development Bond Act, the State Central Valley Project Act, and
other applicable laws of the State of California, between the
State of California, acting by and through its Department of
Water Resources, herein referred to as the "state", and Kern
County Water Agency, a public agency in the State of California,
duly organized, existing, and acting pursuant to the laws thereof
with its principal place of business in Bakersfield, California,
herein referred to as the "Agency",
WITNESSETH, That:
WHEREAS, the State and the Agency have entered into and
subsequently amended a water supply contract, dated November 15,
1963, (herein referred to as the "Amended Contract") providing
that the State shall supply certaln quantities of water to the
Agency, and that the Agency shall make certain payments to the
State, and setting forth the terms and conditions of such supply

AR 012132

)

WHEREAS, the Amended Contract provides for a surcharge
equivalent to the power credit per acre-foot of water to be
charged to water users, other than the United States or the State
of California, for each acre-foot of project water determined to
have been put to agricultural or manufacturing uses on excess
land, for collection by the Agency either itself or through a
retall agency or another agency, for payment to the State of such
surcharge, and for the application, on specified terms and
conditions, of the amount of such surcharge as a credit against
certain payments by certain water users and by the Agency to the
State; and
WHEREAS, the Amended Contract establishes the power
credit per acre-foot of water as two dollars until all of the
facilities for generation of electrical energy in connection
with operation of initial project conservation facilities are
installed and in operation, and provides for a redetermination of
such credit thereafter to reflect accurately increases or
decreases from year to year 1n the power credit; and
WHEREAS, all of such facilities are not installed and

in operation; and

WHEREAS, the power credit of two dollars appears to

AMENDMENT NO, 4 TO WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT
BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND
KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY

THIS CONTRACT, made this 3lstday of December, 1969,
pursuant to the provisions of the California Water Resources
Development Bond Act, the State Central Valley Project Act, and
other applicable laws of the State of California, between the State
of California, acting by and through its Department of Water
Resources, herein referred to as the "State", and Kern County
Water Agency
herein referred to as the "Agency";
WITNESSETH, That
WHEREAS, the State and the Agency have entered into and
subsequently amended a water supply contract providing that the
State will supply certain quantities of water to the Agency, and
providing that the Agency shall make certain payments to the State,
and setting forth the terms and conditions of such supply and such
payment; and
WHEREAS, Article 22(b) of such water supply contract pro-
vides that for each year through the year 1969 the Delta Water
Charge shall be the product of $3.50 and the Agency's annual entitle-
ment for the respective year and that beginning in the year 1970, the
Delta Water Charge shall be the sum of the capital cost component,
minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement component, and

AR 012135

variable operation, maintenance, power and replacement component com-
puted in accordance with Articles 22(c) and (d) of the water supply
contract; and

WHEREAS, Articles 22(e) and (g) of such water supply con-
tract provide that the Delta Water Charge as computed in accordance
with Articles 22(c) and (d) shall include all projected costs of
additional project and supplemental conservation facilities com-
mencing in the years in which the State first incurs capital costs
for such facilities after the facilities are authorized; and
WHEREAS, the parties desire that all water supply contrects
be amended to postpone inclusion of the projected costs of any
authorized additional project and supplemental conservation facilities
in the computation of the Delta Water Charge until after the year
1970 and to fix the rate for computing the Delta Water Charge for
the year 1970 at $6.65; and
WHEREAS, the payments to be made by the Agency to the State
include interest calculated at the "project interest rate" defined
in Article 1(r) of such water supply contract to mean the weighted
average of the interest rates paid by the State on bonds issued
under the Water Resources Development Bond Act (Bond Act) dlsregarding
premiums received on the sale of such bonds; and
WHERZAS, the underlying assumption upon which the 'project
interest rate was established was that all of the initial facilities
of the State Water Resources Development System (Project) would be
financed principally with proceeds of bonds issued under the Bond
Act or from other sources on which the interest rate would not exceed
that of the bonds issued under the Bond Act; and
WHEREAS, the State already has financed the Oroville-

-2 - AR 012136

Thermalito power facilities through Central Valley Project Revenue
Bonds and may finance other portions of the project facilities
through additional revenue bond issues, bonds issued under other
authority granted by the Legislature or the voters, bonds Lssued by
other state agencies, advances from contractors, and other methods
under which the financing costs relate to interest rates that may
exceed the interest rate of the bonds issued under the Bond Act; and
WHEREAS, either the State or contractors making advances
to the State may be subject to interest rates, or other financing
costs that relate to interest rates, which will be greater than the
"project interest rate" as presently defined in the contracts; and
WHEREAS, the parties desire that (1) the interest costs
hereafter incurred by or on behalf of the State in financing the
construction of project facilities by means other than the use of
moneys provided under the Bond Act will be reflected in appropriate
adjustments of the "project interest rate' (excepting the interest
costs incurred for the Central Valley Project Revenue Bonds issued
prior to the date of this amendment); (2) appropriate credit will
be given to any contractor having made an advance of funds to the
State corresponding to the bond service obligation payable by such
contractor by reason of such advance or if bonds were not used to
obtain funds for such advance, then to the net interest cost which
would have resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose
of funding the advance; and (3) if any sources of funds other than
those provided under the Bond Act are employed to finance the con-
struction of specific project facilities and the interest or other
costs of such financing are greater than the cost would have been
if bonds issued under the Bond Act had been used, appropriate

-3- AR 012137

adjustments to the charges to contractors will be made with respect
to such facilities so that the charges to contractors taking water
through reaches which include such facilities will be the same
after such adjustments as such charges would have been if such
facilities had been financed by the use of proceeds of bonds issued
under the Bond Act, except insofar as the "project interest rate"
has been adjusted pursuant to (1) in this recital:
NOW THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed that the following
changes and additions are hereby made to the Agency's water supply
contract with the State:

1. Subdivision (b) of Article 22 is amended to read as

follows:

For each contractor receiving project water in any year
through December 31, 1969, the Delta Water Charge shall be the
product of $3.50 and the contractor's annual entitlement to project
water for the respective year. For each contractor receiving project
water in the year 1970, the Delta Water Charge shall be the product
of $6.65 and the contractor's annual entitlement to project water
for that year. The $6.65 rate for the year 1970 shall consist of a

capital cost component of $5,04 and a minimum operation, maintenance,
power and replacement component of $1.61, After December 31, 1970,
the Delta Water Charge shall consist and be the sum of the following
components as these are computed in accordance with subdivisions (c)
and (d) of this article: a capital cost component; a minimum
operation, maintenance, power and replacement component; and a
variable operation, maintenance, power and replacement component.
2. Subdivision (r) of Article 1 is amended to read as
follows:

-4-
AR 012138

"Project interest rate" shall mean the weighted average
interest rate of (1) through (6) below computed by dividing (1) the
total interest cost required to be pald or credited by the State
during the life of the indebtedness or advance by (ii) the total of
the products of the various principal amounts and the respective.
terms In years of all such amounts:
(1) general obligation bonds issued by the
State under the Bond Act,
(2) revenue bonds lssued by the State under
the Central Valley Project Act after
May 1, 1969,
(3) bonds issued by the State under any other
authority granted by the Legislature or

the voters,

(4) bonds issued by any agency, district, political
subdivision, public corporation, or non-
profit corporation of this State,
(5) funds advanced by any contractor without
the actual incurring of bonded debt therefor,
for which the net interest cost and terms

shall be those which would have resulted if

the contractor had sold bonds far the pur-
pose of funding the advance, as determined
by the State, and
(6) funds borrowed from the General Fund or other

funds in the Treasury of the State of
California, for which the total interest
cost shall be computed at the interest rate
earned over the period of such borrowing
-5- AR 012139

by moneys in the Pooled Money Investment
Account of such Treasury invested in

securities,
to the extent the proceeds of any such bonds, advances or loans are
for construction of the State Water Facilities defined in Section
12934(d) of the Water Code, the additional project conservation
facilities, and the supplemental conservation facilities (except
advances for delivery structures, measuring devices and excess
capacity) and without regard to any premiums received on the sale of
bonds under item (l) above. The "project interest ratel shall be
computed as a decimal fraction to five places.
3. Subdivision (f) of Article 17 is added to the contract
to read as follows:
(€) Adjustments Due to Supplemental Financing Costs
(2) If a contractor, with approval of the State,
advances funds to the State to assist the State in financing con-
struction of project facilities (not including delivery structures,
measuring devices and excess capacity), such advance shall be
amortized by means of annual credits to the contractor having made
such advance of funds to the State, with such credits being equal to
the actual bond service obligations payable by such contractor by
reason of such advance or, if no bonded debt wAs incurred, then such
credits shall be sufficient to cover the repayment of principal and
interest costs which would have resulted if the contractor had sold
bonds for the purpose of funding the advance as determined by the
State.

(2) If, after May 1, 1969, any source of funds
other than those provided by the Bond Act is employed to finance

-6-

construction of specific project facilities, any additilonal.costs
incurred because of such financing will not be charged to the
contractora, except far adjustments to the "project interest rate".

WHEREAS, the power credit of two dollars is and will
be grossly excessive for the year 1970 and thereafter, the
estimated surcharge payments and surcharge credits, based on a
redetermination of the power credit, would be relatively small

mean the following facilities and programs which will serve the
purpose of preventing any reduction in the minimum project yield
as hereinafter defined:

(1) Those project facilities specified in Sec-

tion 12938 of the Water Code:

(2) Those facilities and programs described in
(A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) below which, in the State's determina-
tion, are engineeringly feasible and capable of producing project
water which is economically competitive with alternative new water
supply sources, provided that, in the State's determination, the
construction and operation of such facilities and programs will
not interfere with the requested deliveries of annual entitlement
to any contractor other than the sponsoring contractor, and will
not result in any greater annual charges to any contractor other
than the sponsoring contractor than would have occurred with the
construction at the same time of alternative new water supply
-2- AR 012194

sources which are either reservoirs located north of the Delta or
off-Aqueduct storage reservoirs located south or west of the Delta
designed to supply water to the California Aqueduct. The follow-
ing facilities and programs shall hereinafter be referred to as
"Local Projects":

(A) On-stream and off-stream surface storage
reservoirs not provided for in Section 12938 of the Water Code,
that will produce project water for the System for a period of
time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor;

(B) Ground water storage facilities that will
produce project water for the System for a period of time agreed
to by the sponsoring contractor;

(C) Waste water reclamation facilities that
will produce project water for the System for a period of time
agreed to by the sponsoring contractor;

(D) Water and facilities for delivering water
purchased by the State for the System for a period of time agreed
to by the sponsoring contractor; provided that the economic test
specified berein shall be applied to the cost of these facilities
together with the cost of the purchased water; and
(E) Future water conservation programs and

facilities that will reduce demands by the sponsoring contractor
for project water from the System for a period of time agreed to
by the sponsoring contractor and will thereby have the effect of
increasing project water available in the Delta for distribution.

(3) Whether a Local Project described in (2) above

shall be considered economically competitive shall be determined
by the State by comparing, in an engineering and economic
analysis, such Local Project with alternative new water supply

-3-
AR 012195

sources which are either reservoirs located north of the Delta or
off-Aqueduct storage reservoirs located south or west of the Delta
designed to supply water to the California Aqueduct. The analysis
for such alternative new water supply sources shall use the
average cost per acre-foot of yield in the latest studies made for
such sources by the State and shall compare those facilities with
the proposed Local Project using commonly accepted engineering
economics. In the case of a Local Project to be funded in part by
the State as part of the System and in part from other sources,
the economic analysis specified herein shall be applied only to
the portion to be funded by the State as part of the System.
(4) The Local Projects in (2) above shall not be
constructed or implemented unless or until:

(A) The sponsoring contractor signs a written
agreement with the State which:

(i) Contains the sponsoring contractor's
approval of such facility or program.

(ii) Specifies the yield and the period
of time during which the water from the Local Project shall
constitute project water; and

(iii) Specifies the disposition of such
Local Project or of the yield from such Local Project upon the
expiration of such period of time; and

(B) All contractors within whose boundaries
any portion of such Local Project is located, and who are not
sponsoring contractors for such Local Project give their written
approval of such Local Project.

-4-
AR 012196

(5) "Sponsoring contractor" as used in this Art-
icle 1(h) shall mean the contractor or contractors who either will
receive the yield from facilities described in 2(A), (B), (C), or

(D) above, or agree to reduce demands for project water from the
System pursuant to 2 (E) above.

(6) In the event of a shortage in water supply
within the meaning of Article 18(a), the determination of whether
to count, in whole or in part, the yield from facilities described
in 2(A), (B), (C), or (D) above, or the reduced demand from future
conservation programs described in 2(E) above in the allocation of
deficiencies among contractors will be based on a project-by-
project evaluation taking into consideration such factors as any
limitation on the use of the water from such facilities and
whether the sponsoring contractor has access to project water from
the Delta as an alternate to such facilities.

3. Article 1(i)(2) is amended to read:

(2) Facilities for the generation and transmission
of electrical energy of the following types:

(A) Hydroelectric generating and transmission
facilities, whose operation is dependent on the transportation of
project water, or on releases to channels downstream of project
facilities defined under (1) above. Such facilities shall be

called "project aqueduct power recovery plants."

(B) Al1 other generating and associated
transmission facilities, except those dependent on water from
project conservation facilities, for the generation of power.
These facilities shall be called "off-aqueduct power facilities"
and shall consist of the State's interest in the Reid-Gardner and

-5-
AR 012197

any other generating and associated transmission facilities, con-
structed or financed in whole or in part by the State, which are
economically competitive with alternative power supply sources as
determined by the State.

4 . Article 1(r) is amended to read:
(r) Project Interest Rate
"Project interest rate" shall mean the weighted
average interest rate of (1) through (6) below computed by
dividing (i) the total interest cost required to be paid or
credited by the State during the life of the indebtedness or
advance by (ii) the total of the products of the various principal
amounts and the respective terms in years of all such amounts:
(1) general obligation bonds issued by the State
under the Bond Act,

(2) revenue bonds issued by the State under the
Central Valley Project Act after May 1, 1969,

(3) bonds issued by the State under any other
authority granted by the Legislature or the voters,
(4) bonds issued by any agency, district, polit-
ical subdivision, public corporation, or nonprofit
corporation of this State,

(5) funds advanced by any contractor without the
actual incurring of bonded debt therefor, for which the net
interest cost and terms shall be those which would have

resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose of
funding the advance, as determined by the State, and

(6) funds borrowed from the General Fund or other
funds in the Treasury of the State of California, for which
the total interest cost shall be computed at the interest

-6- AR 012198

rate earned over the period of such borrowing by moneys in
the Pooled Money Investment Account of such Treasury invested'

in securities,
to the extent the proceeds of any such bonds, advances or loans
are for construction of the State Water Facilities defined in
Section 12934(d) of the Water Code, the additional project
conservation facilities, and the supplemental conservation
facilities, (except off-aqueduct power facilities and advances for
delivery structures, measuring devices and excess capacity) and
without regard to any premiums received on the sale of bonds under

item (1) above. The "project interest rate" shall be computed as

a decimal fraction to five places.

5. Subdivision (h) is added to Article 22 to read:

(h) The determination of the rate for water under the
Delta Water Charge shall be made by including the appropriate
costs and quantities of water, calculated in accordance with
subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) above, for all additional project
conservation facilities as defined in Article 1(h) hereinabove.
In the event a Local Project as defined in Article 1(h)(2) will,
pursuant to written agreement between the State and the sponsoring
contractor, be considered and treated as an additional project
conservation facility for less than the estimated life of the
facility, the rate under the Delta Water Charge will be determined
on the basis of that portion of the appropriate cost and water
supply associated with such facility as the period of time during
which such facility shall be considered as an additional project
conservation facility bears to the estimated life of such facil-

ity. No costs for the construction or implementation of any Local

-7-
AR 012199

Project are to be included in the Delta Water Charge unless and
until the written agreement required by Article 1 (h) has been
entered into.

6. Subdivision (i) is added to Article 22 to read:

(i) In calculating the rate for project water to be
paid by each contractor for the Delta Water Charge under subdivi-
sions (c), (d) and (e) above, the component for operation, mainte-
nance, power and replacement costs shall include, but not be
limited to, all costs to the State incurred in purchasing water,
which is competitive with alternative sources as determined by the
State, for delivery as project water.

7. Subdivision (f) is added to Article 24 to read:
(f) The capital costs of project aqueduct power recov-
ery plants shall be charged and allocated in accordance with this

Article 24. The capital costs of off-aqueduct power facilities
shall be charged and allocated in accordance with Article 25(d).

8. Subdivision (d) is added to Article 25 to read:
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (a)
and (b) of this article, or of Article 1(s), the costs of off-
aqueduct power facilities shall be determined and allocated as

follows:

(1) The off-aqueduct power costs shall include all
annual costs the State incurs for any off-aqueduct power facility,
which shall include, but not be limited to, power purchases, any
annual principal and interest payments on funds borrowed by or
advanced to the State, annual principal and interest on bonds
issued by the State or other agency, or under revenue bond
financing contracts, any requirements for coverage, deposits to
reserves, and associated operation and maintenance costs of such

-8-
AR 012200

facility, less any credits, interest earnings, or other monies
received by the State in connection with such facility. In the

event the State finances all or any part of an off-aqueduct power
facility directly from funds other than bonds or borrowed funds,
in lieu of such annual. principal and interest payments, the repay™
ment of capital costs as to that part financed by such other funds
shall be determined on the basis of the schedule that would have
been required under Article 24.

(2) The annual costs of off-aqueduct power facil-
ities as computed in (1) above shall initially be allocated among
contractors in amounts which bear the same proportions to the
total amount of such power costs that the total estimated

electrical energy (kilowatt hours) required to pump through proj-
ect transportation facilities the desired delivery amounts of
annual entitlements for that year, as submitted pursuant to
Article 12(a) (1) and as may be modified by the State pursuant to
Article 12(a) (2), bears to the total estimated electrical energy
(kilowatt hours) required to pump all such amounts for all
contractors through project transportation facilities for that

year, all as determined by the State.

(3) An interim adjustment in the allocation of the

power costs calculated in accordance with (2) above, may be made
in May of each year based on April revisions in approved schedules
of deliveries of annual entitlement for such year. A further

adjustment shall be made in the following year based on actual
deliveries of annual entitlement; provided, however, in the event
no deliveries are made through a pumping plant, the adjustments
shall not be made for that year at that plant.

-9-
AR 012201

(4) TO the extent the monies received or to be
received by the State from all contractors for off-aqueduct power
costs in any year are determined by the State to be less than the
amount required to pay the off-agueduct power costs in such year,
the State may allocate and charge that amount of off-aqueduct
power costs to the Agency and other contractors in the same manner
as costs under the capital cost component of the Transportation
Charge are allocated and charged. After that amount has been so
allocated, charged and collected, the State shall provide a
reallocation of the amounts allocated pursuant to this paragraph
(4), such reallocation to be based on the allocations made

pursuant to (2) and (3) above for that year, or in the event no
such allocation was made for that year, on the last previous
allocation made pursuant to (2) and (3) above. Any such
reallocation shall include appropriate interest at the project
interest rate.

9. Subdivision (e) is added to Article 25 to read:

(e) The total minimum operation, maintenance, power and
replacement component due that year from each contractor shall be
the sum of the allocations made under the proportionate use of
facilities method provided in subdivision (b) of this article and
the allocations made pursuant to subdivision (d) of this article
for each contractor.

10. Subdivision (b) of Article 32 is amended to read:

(b) Interest on Overdue Payments
Upon every amount of money required to be paid by
the Agency to the State pursuant to this contract which remains
unpaid after it becomes due and payable, interest shall accrue at

-10-

AR 012202

an annual rate equal to that earned by the Pooled Money Investment
Fund, as provided in Government Code Sections 16480, et seq.
calculated monthly on the amount of such delinquent payment from
and after the due date until it is paid, and the Agency hereby
agrees to pay such interest: provided, that no interest shall be
charged to OL be paid by the Agency unless such delinquency
continues for more than thirty (30) days.

Article 1(r)(3) and except for bonds issued by the State under the Central
Valley Project Act after January 1, 1987 for facilities not listed among the
water system facilities in Article 1(hh). Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding exception, such amortization shall also apply to any adjustments in
this component charge resulting from a change in the project interest rate due
to any refunding after January 1, 1986 of bonds issued under the Central Valley
Project Act. However, amortization of adjustments resulting from items 1(r)(4)
through (7) shall be limited to a period which would allow the Department to

repay the debt service on a current basis until such time as bonds are issued
to reimburse the source of such funding. In no event shall this amortization
period be greater than the project repayment period.

AR 012216

7. Article 28(f) of the Agency's water supply contract with the State
is added as follows:

f. Adjustment: Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs,
The use of water system revenue bonds for finanaing facilities listed in

Article 1(hh) would result in adjustments for prior underpayments or

overpayments of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge to the
Agenoy under the provisions of this artiole; however, in place of making such
adjustments, charges to the Agenoy will be governed by Article 50.

8. Article 50 of the Agency's water supply contract with the State

is added as follows:

50. Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs.

(a) Charges to the Agency for water system revenue bond
financing costs shall be governed by provisions of this article, Charges to
all contractors for water syst em revenue bond financing costs shall return to
the State an amount equal to the annual financing costs the State inours in
that year for water syst em revenue bonds (including water system revenue bond
anticipation notes), Annual finanoing costs shall include, but not be limited
to, any annual principal and interest on water system revenue bonds plus any
additional requirements for bond debt service coverage, deposits to reserves,
and annual premiums for insurance or other security obtained pursuant to

subdivision (f) of this article. The State shall provide credits to the
contractors for excess reserve funds, excess debt service coverage, interest,
and other earnings of the State in connection with repayment of such revenue
bond financing oosts, when and as permitted by the bond resolution. When such

8

AR 012217

credits are determined by the State to be available, such credits shall be
promptly provided to the contractors and shall be in proportion to the payments
under this artiale from each contractor. Reserves, bond debt service oover age,

interest, and other earnings may be used in the last year to retire the bonds.
(b) Annual charges to recover water system revenue bond
financing costs shall consist of two elements.

(1) The first element shall be an annual charge to the
Agency for repayment of capital costs of water system facilities as determined
under Articles 22 and 24 of this contract with interest at the project interest

rate. For conservation facilities, the charge shall be a part of the capital
cost component of the Delta Water Charge in accordance with Article 22. For

transportation faciltties, the charge shall be a part of the capital cost
component of the Transportation Charge In accordance with Article 24.

(2) The second element shall be the Agency's share of a
Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge to be paid in lieu of a project interest
rate adjustment, The total annual amount to be paid by all contractors under
this element shall be the difference between the total annval charges under the
first element and the annual financing costs of the water system revenue
bonds. The amount to be paid by each contractor shall be calculated annually
as if the project interest rate were increased to the extent neoessary to
produce revenues from all contractors sufficient to pay such difference for
that year. In making that calculation, adjustments in the Agency's
Transportation capital cost component charges for prior overpayments and
underpayments shall be determined as if amortized over the remaining years of
the project repayment period.

9

AR 012218

(a) The Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge will be
identified by component and charge in the Agency's invoice.
(d) Timing of Payments. Payments shall be made in accordance
with Article 29(f) of this contraot.
(e) Reduction in Charges. The Water System Revenue Bond
Surcharge under Artiole 50(b) (2) shall cease for each series of water system
revenue bonds when that series is fully repaid. However, the annual charge
determined pursuant to Article 50(b) (1) shall continue to be collected for the

time periods otherwise required under Articles 22 and 24.

After the Department has repaid the California Water Fund
in full and after each series of Water System Revenue Bonds is repaid, the
Department will reduce the charges to all contractors In an equitable manner in

a total amount that equals the amount of the charges under Article 50 (b)(1)
that the Department determines is not needed for future financing of facilities
of the System which, in whole or in part, will serve the purposes of the water
supply contract with the Agency,
(f) To the extent economically feasible and justifiable, as
determined by the State after consultation with contractors, the State shall
maintain insurance or other forms of security protecting bondholders and non-
defaulting contractors against costs resulting from the failure of any
contractor to make the payments required by this article.
( g) Before issuing each series of water system revenue bonds,
the State shall consult with the contractors, prepare a plan for the State's
future financing of water syst em facilities, and give the Agency an opportunity
to comment on the plan. The plan shall include but not be limited to the size

10

AR 012219

of any water system revenue bond issuances and the form of any necessary
resolutions or supplements.

(h) Defaults. (1) If a contraotor defaults partially or
entirely on its payment obligations calculated under this article and
sufficient insurance or other security protecting the non-defaulting

contractors is not provided under Article 50(f), the State shall allocate a

portion of the default to eaoh non-defaulting contractor. The Agency's share

of the default shall be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the total

default amount to be charged to all non-defaulting contractors by the ratio
that the Agenoy's maximum Table A entitlement bears to the maximum Table A

entitlements of all non-defaulting contractors. However, such amount shall not

exceed in any year 25 percent of the Water System Revenue Bond financing costs
that are otherwise payable by the Agency in that year. The amount of default

to be charged to non-defaulting contractors shall be reduced by any receipts
from insurance proteoting non-defaulting contraotors and bond debt service
coverage from a prior year and available for such purpose,

(2) If a contractor defaults partially or entirely on its
payment obligations under this article, the State shall also pursuant to

Article 20, upon six months' notice to the defaulting contractor, suspend water

deliveries under Article 20 to the defaulting contractor so long as the default

continues. The suspension of water deliveries shall be proportional to the
ratio of the default to the total water system revenue bond payments due from
the defaulting contractor. However, the State may reduce, eliminate, or not

commence suspension of deliveries pursuant to this subpar agraph if it
determines suspension in the amounts otherwise required is 1ikely to impair the

11

AR 012220

defaulting contractor's abwiity to avold further defaults o. that there would
be insufficient water for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection.
The State may distribute the suspended water to the non-defaulting contractors
on terms it determines to be equitable.
(3) During the period of default, credits otherwise due
the defaulting oontractor shall be applied to payments due from the defaulting

contractor,

(4) Except as otherwise provided in Article 50 (h) (3), the
defaulting contractor shall repay the entire amount of the default to the State
with interest compounded annually at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate
before water deliveries that had been suspended shall be fully resumed to that

contraator, If the defaulting contractor makes a partial repayment of its
default, the Department may provide a proportional restoration of suspended
deliveries. The amount of the default to be repaid shall include any amounts
previously received by the State from insurance proceeds, bond debt service
coverage, or other reserves, and payments from other contractors pursuant to
this subparagraph (h). The defaulting contractor shall not be entitled to any
make-up water deliveries as compensation for any water deliveries suspended
during the period when the contractor was in default.
(5) At such time as the default amount is repald by the
defaulting contraotor, the non-defaulting contraotors shall receive credits in
proportion to their contributions towards the amount of the default with
interest collected by the State on the defaulted amount.
(6) In the event there is an increase in the amount a non-
defaulting contraotor contributes to reserves and/or bond debt service

12

AR 012221

coverage, such increase shall be handled in the same manner as provided in

Artiole 50(a).

(7) Aotion taken pur suant to this subarticle shall not
deprive the State of or limit any remedy provided by this contract or by law
for the recovery of money due or whioh may become due under this contract.

(i) Power of Termination.

(1) The Department and the Agency agree to negotiate in
good faith the development of a means to provide adequate proteotion for the

Department's cash flow into priorities one and t Wo for revenues under Water

Code Section 12937(b) with the goal of obtaining agreement by April 1, 1987.

The Department and the Agency agree to continue negotiations beyond April 1,
1987 if necessary to meet their common goal of arriving at agreement,
(2) If such an agreement has not been reached by April 1,
1987, and if the Director of Water Resources determines that adequate progress
has not been made toward such an agreement, the Director may give notice to the
Agency and other contractors that he intends to exercise the power to terminate
provided in this subarticle 50 (i). The Director's authority to give such a
notice shall terminate on July 1, 1988,
(3) After six months from the date of issuing the notice
of intent to terminate, but in no even later than January 1, 1989, the
Director may terminate the authority of the Department to issue additional
series of water system revenue bonds using the repayment provisions of Article

50. The Department shall promptly notify the Agency and other contractors that

the Director has exercised the power of termination.

13

AR 012222

(4) No additional series of water system revenue bonds
shall be issued under the provisions of this Article 50 after the Director has
exercised the power to terminate, but Article 50 shall remain in effect as to
any series of water system revenue bonds issued prior to the time the Director
exercises the power to terminate.
(5) An exercise of the power to terminate provided in this
subarticle 50(i) shall also rescind any changes made by this amendment in the
schedule of payment of overpayment or underpayment of capital costs resulting
from a change in the project interest rate and shall also rescind the addition

of item (7) to Article 1(r). However, if the Department has borrowed any funds
under Article 1(r)(7), Article 1(r) (7) shall remain in effeot as to that and
only that borrowing. Upon the exercising of the power to terminate,
subarticles 28( e) and (f) shall be rescinded and Article 1(r) shall read as it
previously read as shown on Attachment Number 1 to this amendment,

(6) At any time before January 1, 1989, so long as the

Director has not already exercised the power of termination, the Director may
irrevocably waive his right to exercise the power of termination or may rescind
any previously issued notice of intention to terminate.
(7) If the Director does not exercise the power of

termination before January 1, 1989, this Subarticle 50(i) shall expire, and the
remainder of this Article 50 shall remain in effect. Changes made by this
amendment to other articles shall also remain in effect

(f) Power Costs.

(1) Beginning January 1, 1991, the Agency shall
pay power charges for pumping surplus water as follows:
(A) If during a calendar month it is either
not necessary to purchase power for pumping surplus water, or it
is necessary to purchase power for pumping surplus water and the
purchased power rate is less than or equal to the Melded Power
Rate (defined as the average unit charge for pumping entitlement
water during the calendar year for all power resources, including
on-aqueduct power resources, off-aqueduct power resources, and

(B) If during a calendar month it is
necessary to purchase power for pumping surplus water and the
purchased power rate is greater than the Melded Power Rate, the
monthly charges to the Agency for the Net Power used to pump
surplus water for delivery to the Agency shall be determined
using a composite rate equal to the sum of:
(i) The monthly average purchased power
rate per unit of power so purchased times the power purchased for
pumping surplus water and that result divided by the Net Power;
plus,

(ii) The Melded Power Rate per unit of
power times a quantity which equals the Net Power used for
pumping surplus water minus the power purchased for pumping
surplus water and that result divided by the Net Power.

(C) In all cases, the power charges shall
include the cost of any additional transmission service required
for the delivery of surplus water to the Agency.

4

AR 012234

(2) By receiving surplus or unscheduled water

January 1, 1991, only if, by January 31, 1991 an Amendment
substantially the same as this one is executed by contractors
that together have maximum annual entitlements totaling at least
3,796,007 acre-feet. By February 15, 1991, the State will inform

the Agency of whether sufficient contractors had executed the

Amendment to cause the Amendment to take effect.

6 Article 18 and to insure that the amounts, times, and rates of

7 delivery to the Agency will be consistent with the State's overall

8 delivery ability, considering the then current delivery schedules

9 of all contractors. On or before December 1 of each year, the State

10 shall determine' and furnish to the Agency the water delivery

11 schedule for the next succeeding year which shall show the amounts

12 of water to be delivered to the Agency during each month of that

14 15. Article 18 is amended to read:

15 18. SHORTAGE IN WATER SUPPLY

16 (a) Shortages; Delivery Priorities

17 In any year in which there may occur a shortage due to drought

18 or any other cause whatsoever, in the supply of project water

19 available for delivery to the contractors, with the result that such

20 supply is less than the total of the annual entitlements of all

21 contractors for that year, the State shall allocate the available

22 supply in proportion to each contractor's annual entitlement as set

23 forth in its Table A for that year and shall reduce the allocation

24 of project water to each contractor using such water for

25 agricultural purposes and to each contractor using such water for

26 other purposes by the same percentage of their respective annual

27 entitlements for that year: Provided, that the State may allocate

28 on some other basis if such is required to meet minimum demands of

9 AR 012245

--

1 contractors for domestic supply, fire protection, or sanitation
2 during the year. If contractor is allocated more water than it

3 requested, the excess water shall be reallocated among the other

4 contractors in proportion to their annual entitlements as provided

5 for above. The foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall be

6 inoperative to the extent necessary to comply with subdivision (c)

7 of this article and to the extent that a contractor's annual

8 entitlement for the respective year reflects established rights

9 under the area of origin statutes precluding a reduction in

10 deliveries to such contractor.

11 (b) Deleted

12 (c) Permanent Shortage; Contracts for Areas-of-Origin

13 In the event that the State, because of the establishment by

14 a party of a prior right to water under the provisions of Sections

15 11460 through 11463 of the Water Code, enters into a contract with

16 such party for a dependable supply of project water, which contract

17 will cause a permanent shortage in the supply of project water to

18 be made available to the Agency hereunder:

19 (1) The State shall: (i) equitably redistribute the costs of

20 all transportation facilities included in the System among all

21 contractors for project water, taking into account the diminution

22 of the supply to the Agency and other prior contractors in

23 accordance with the terms of their contracts, and (ii) revise the

24 Agency's annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlement, by

25 amendment of Table A of this contract to correspond to the reduced

26 supply of project water to be made available to the Agency:

27 Provided, That such redistribution of costs of transportation

28 facilities shall not be made until there has been reasonable

10 AR 012246

-

1 opportunity for the Agency to exercise the option provided for in

2 (2) below, and for other prior contractors to exercise similar

3 options.

4 (2) The Agency, at its option, shall have the right to use

5 any of the project transportation facilities which by reason of such

water to be made 6 permanent shortage in the supply of project

7 available to the Agency are not required for delivery of project

8 water to the Agency, to transport water procured by it from any
other source: Provided, That such use shall be within the limits

10 of the capacities provided in the project transportation facilities

11 for service to the Agency under this contract: Provided further,

12 That, except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the

13 Water Code be changed, the Agency shall not use the project

14 transportation facilities under this option to transport water the

15 right to which was secured by the Agency through eminent domain

16 unless such use be approved by the Legislature by concurrent

17 resolution with a majority of the members elected to each house

18 voting in favor thereof. This option shall terminate upon a

19 redistribution of costs of transportation facilities by the State

20 pursuant to (1) above. In the event that this option is exercised,
in making such 21 the State shall take such fact into account

22 redistribution of costs, and shall offset such use as is made of the

23 project transportation facilities pursuant thereto against any

24 reduction in the Agency's payment obligation hereunder resulting

25 from such redistribution of costs.

11 AR 012247

1 (d) Reinstatement of Entitlements

2 I£ after any revision of annual entitlements and maximum

3 annual entitlements pursuant to subdivision (c) of this article,

4 circumstances arise which, in the judgment of the State, justify a

5 revision upward of the same, the State shall, with the consent of

6 the affected contractor, reinstate proportionately the previously
reduced entitlements of such contractor to the extent deemed

8 justified, and shall equitably redistribute the costs of the project

9 transportation facilities if inequities would otherwise occur as a

10 result of such reinstatement of entitlements.

11 (e) Advance Notice of Delivery Reductions

12 The State shall give the Agency written notice as far in

13 advance as possible of any reduction in deliveries to it which is

14 to be made under subdivision (a) of this article and, to the extent

15 possible, shall give the Agency written notice five (5) years in

16 advance of any reduction in its annual entitlements and maximum

17 annual entitlement under subdivision (c) of this article. Reports

18 submitted to the Agency pursuant to Article 16(c) may constitute

19 such notices.

20 (E) No Liability for Shortages

21 Neither the State nor any of its officers, agents, or

22 employees shall be liable for any damage, direct or indirect,

23 arising from shortages in the amount of water to be made available

24 for delivery to the Agency under this contract caused by drought,

25 operation of area of origin statutes, or any other cause beyond its

26 control.

5 (a) Allocation of Interruptible Water

6 Each year from water sources available to the project, the

7 State shall make available and allocate interruptible water to

8 contractors in accordance with the procedure in Article 18(a).

9 Allocations of interruptible water in any one year may not be

10 carried over for delivery in a subsequent year, nor shall the

11 delivery of interruptible water in any year impact a contractor's

12 approved deliveries of annual entitlement or the contractor's

13 allocation of water for the next year. Deliveries of interruptible

14 water in excess of a contractor's annual entitlement may be made if

15 the deliveries do not adversely affect the State's delivery of

16 annual entitlement to other contractors or adversely affect project

17 operations. Any amounts of water owed to the Agency as of the date

18 of this amendment pursuant to former Article 12 (d), any contract

19 provisions or letter agreements relating to wet weather water, and

20 any Article 14 (b) balances accumulated prior to 1995, are canceled.

21 The State shall hereafter use its best efforts, in a manner that

22 causes no adverse impacts upon other contractors or the project, to

23 avoid adverse economic impacts due to a contractor's inability to

24 take water during wet weather.

25 (b) Rates

26 For any interruptible water delivered pursuant to this

27 article, contractors shall pay the State the same (including

28 adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct,

13 AR 012249

1. off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation

2 of such water as if such interruptible water were entitlement water,

3 as well as all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement

4 costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State.

5 The State shall not include any administrative or contract

6 preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower

7 costs which would not be incurred if interruptible water were not

8 scheduled for or delivered to the contractor. Only those

9 contractors not participating in the repayment of the capital costs

10 of a reach shall be required to pay any use of facilities charge for

11 the delivery of interruptible water through that reach.

12 (c) Contracts

13 To obtain a supply of interruptible water, a contractor shall

14 execute a further contract with the State which shall be in

15 conformity with this article and shall include at least provisions

16 concerning the scheduling of deliveries of interruptible water and

17 times and methods of payment.

18

19 17. Article 22 (†) is amended to read:

20 (j) Notwithstanding provisions of Article 22 (a) through (i),

21 the capital cost component and the minimum OMP&R component of the

22 Delta Water Charge shall include an annual charge to recover the

23 Agency's share of the conservation portion of the water system

24 revenue bond financing costs. Charges to the Agency for these costs

25 shall be calculated in accordance with provisions in Article 50 of

26 this contract. Charges for the conservation portion of the water

27 system revenue bond financing costs shall not be affected by any

28 reductions in payments pursuant to Article 51.

2 (b) In the first step, the total amount of capital costs of

3 each aqueduct reach to be returned to the State shall be allocated

4 among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or

5 through the reach by the proportionate use of facilities method of

6 cost allocation and in accordance with (1) and (2) below. The

7 measure of the proportionate use of each contractor of each reach

8 shall be the average of the following two ratios: (i) the ratio of

9 the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or

10 through the reach to the total of the maximum annual ent.itlements

11 of all contractors to be delivered from or through the reach from

12 the year in which charges are to be paid through the end of the

13 project repayment period and (ii) the ratio of the capacity provided

14 in the reach for the transport and delivery of project water to the

15 contractor to the total capacity provided in the reach for the

16 transport and delivery of project water to all contractors served

17 from or through the reach from the year in which charges are to be

18 paid through the end of the project repayment period. Allocations

19 of capital costs to the Agency pursuant hereto shall be on the basis

20 of relevant values which will be set forth in Table B of this

21 contract by the State as soon as designs and cost estimates are

22 prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the Agency as

23 to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each

24 aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities for the

25 transport and delivery of project water to the Agency, pursuant to

26 Article 17(a): Provided, That these values shall be subject to

27 redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 28: Provided

28 further, That the principles and procedures set forth in this

15 AR 012251

•

1 subdivision shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs

2 to the Agency. Proportionate use of facilities factors for prior

3 years shall not be adjusted by the State in response to changes or

4 transfers of entitlement among contractors unless otherwise agreed

5 by the State and the parties to the transfer and unless there is no

6 impact on past charges or credits of other contractors.

7

8 19. Article 24 (g) is amended to read:

9 (g) Notwithstanding provisions of Article 24 (a) through (d),

10 the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge shall

11 include an annual charge to recover the Agency's share of the

12 transportation portion of the water system revenue bond financing

13 costs. Charges to the Agency for these costs shall be calculated

14 in accordance with the provisions of Article 50 of this contract.

15 Charges for the transportation portion of the water system revenue

16 bond financing costs shall not be affected by any reductions in

17 payments pursuant to Article 51.

18

19 20. Article 25 (d) (3) is amended to read:

20 (3) An interim adjustment in the allocation of the power costs

21 calculated in accordance with (2) above, may be made in May of each

22 year based on April revisions in approved schedules of deliveries

23 of project and nonproject water for contractors for such year. A

24 further adjustment shall be made in the following year based on

25 actual deliveries of project and nonproject water for contractors

26 provided, however, in the event no deliveries are made through a

27 pumping plant, the adjustments shall not be made for that year at

28 that plant.

11 in the event of emergency or cash flow shortages.

12 (2) An initial deposit of $15 million shall be made available

13 from revenue bond reserves that are no longer required by revenue

14 bond covenants and that would otherwise be credited to the

15 contractors including the Agency. In 1998 or when the funds become

16 available an additional $7.7 million will be deposited in the

17 General Operating Account from revenue bond reserves that are no

18 longer required by revenue bond covenants and that would otherwise

19 be credited to the contractors including the Agency, bringing the

20 deposits to that account under this article to $22.7 million.

21 (3) The balance in the General Operating Account will

22 increase pursuant to subdivision (e) (3) (v) of this article to an

23 amount determined by the State but not in excess of $32 million.

24 However, after the year 2001, the maximum amount of the fund may

25 increase or decrease annually by not more than the same percentage

26 as the increase or decrease in the charges, other than power charges

27 for pumping water, to all the contractors for the previous year from

28

5 Capital Account to be funded from revenues available under Water

6 Code section 12937 (b) (4). Through procedures described in this

7 article and as limited by this article, the State may consider as

8 a revenue need under subdivision (c) (2) (v) of this article and may

9 deposit in the State Water Facilities Capital Account the amounts

10 necessary to pay capital costs of the State Water Facilities for

11 which neither general obligation bond nor revenue bond proceeds are

12 available, including but not limited to planning, reconnaissance and

13 feasibility studies, the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program and,

14 through the year 2000, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.

15 (2) The Director of the Department of Water Resources shall

16 fully consult with the contractors and consider any advice given

17 prior to depositing funds into this account for any purposes.

18 Deposits into this account shall not exceed the amounts specified

19 in subdivision (c) (2) (v) of this article plus any amounts determined

20 pursuant to subdivision (e) (1) (iii) of this article.

26 the timing provisions of Articles 29 and 31 the amounts that would

27 have been charged (but for this article) to each contractor as

28 provided in other provisions of this contract.

18 AR 012254

1 (2) Each year the State shall also establish its revenue

2 needs for the following year for the following purposes, subject to

(ii) The amount required for payment of the reasonable
costs of the annual maintenance and operation of the State Water

9 Resources Development System and the replacement of any parts

10 thereof as described in Water Code section 12937 (b) (1). These costs

11 shall not include operation and maintenance costs of any Federal

12 Central Valley Project facilities constructed by the United States

13 and acquired by the State of California after 1994, other than the

14 State's share of the joint use facilities which include San Luis

15 Reservoir, the San Luis Canal and related facilities.

17 of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to the Burns-Porter Act

18 as described in Water Code section 12937 (b) (2).

19 (iv) Any amount required for transfer to the California

20 Water Fund in reimbursement as described in Water Code section

21 12937 (b) (3) for funds utilized from said fund for construction of

22 the State Water Resources Development System.

23 (v) For the years 1998 and thereafter, the amount needed

24 for deposits into the State Water Facilities Capital Account as

25 provided in subdivision (b) of this article, but (A) not more than

26 $6 million per year for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, and (B) not

27 more than $4.5 million per year for the years 2001 and thereafter.

19 AR 012255

1 (3) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (e) of this

2 article, the State shall reduce the annual charges in the aggregate

3 for all contractors by the amounts by which the hypothetical charges

4 calculated pursuant to subdivision (c) (1) above exceed the revenue

5 needs determined pursuant to subdivisión (c) (2) above. The

6 reductions under this article shall be apportioned among the

7 contractors as provided in subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (g) of
this article. Reductions to contractors shall be used to reduce the

9 payments due from the contractors on each January 1 and July 1;

10 Provided, however, that to the extent required pursuant to

11 subdivision (h) of this article, each Agricultural Contractor shall

12 pay to the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund an amount equal

13 to the reduction allocated to such Agricultural Contractor. Any

14 default in payment to the trust fund shall be subject to the same

15 remedies as any default in payment to the State under this contract.

16 (4) The State may submit a supplemental billing to the Agency

17 for the year in an amount not to exceed the amount of the prior

18 reductions for such year under this article if necessary to meet

19 unanticipated costs for purposes identified in Water Code section

20 12937 (b) (1) and (2) for which the State can issue billings under

21 other provisions of this contract. Any supplemental billing made

22 to the Agency for these purposes shall be in the same proportion to

23 the total supplemental billings to all contractors for these

24 purposes as the prior reduction in charges to the Agency in that

25 year bears to the total reductions in charges to all contractors in

26 that year and shall be treated as reducing the amount of the

27 reduction made available for that year to the Agency by the amount

28 of the supplemental bill to the Agency.

20 AR 012256

1 (5) •The State may also submit a supplemental billing to the

2 Agency for the year if necessary to meet unanticipated costs for

3 revenue bond debt service and coverage for which the State can issue

4 a statement of charges under provisions of this contract other than

5 this article. The relative amounts of any supplemental billing made

6 to the Agency and to other contractors for revenue bond purposes

7 shall be governed by such other applicable provisions of this

8 contract.

9 (6) Payment of any supplemental billing shall be due thirty

10 days after the date of the invoice. Delinquency and interest on

11 delinquent amounts due shall be governed by Article 32.

12 (d) Apportionment of Reductions between Agricultural and Urban Contractors
13 (1) Reductions available under this article are projected to
14
begin to occur in 1997. The numbers and percentages in this
15 subdivision reflect certain estimates of dollars and sharing of
16
reductions. The
17 actual reductions may vary slightly from the
amounts described below. The State shall determine the availability
18 of reductions for each year in accordance with this article.
19
(2) Reductions shall be phased in as follows:
20
(i) In 1997 reductions in the amount of $14 million are
21 projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first
22
$10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the
23 • Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be

24 apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
25
(ii) In 1998 reductions in the amount of $17 million are
26 projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first
27
$10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the
28

21. AR 012257

1 Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be

2 apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

3 (iii) In 1999 reductions in the amount of $32 million

4 are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the

5 first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the

6 Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be

7 apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

8 (iv) In 2000 reductions in the amount of $33 million are

9 projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first

10 $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the

11 Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be

12 apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

13 (3) (i) In the event that the aggregate amount of reductions

14 in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is less than the respective

15 amount projected for such year in subdivision (d) (2) above, the

16 shortfall shall be taken first from reductions that would have been

17 provided to Urban Contractors. Only after all reductions to Urban

18 Contractors have been eliminated in a given year shall the remaining

19 shortfall be taken from reductions scheduled for Agricultural

20 Contractors. Any projected reductions not made available due to

21 such shortfalls in the years 1997 through 2000 shall be deferred

22 with interest at the project interest rate to the earliest

23 subsequent years when reductions in excess of those projected for

24 those years are available. Such deferred reductions with interest

25 at the project interest rate shall be applied to the charges of the

26 contractors whose reductions have been deferred.

27 (ii) In the event that the aggregate amount of

28 reductions available in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is

22 AR 012258

1 greater than the sum of (A) the respective amount projected for such

2 year in subdivision (d) (2) above, plus (B) the amount of any

3 shortfall with accrued interest at the project interest rate,

4 remaining from any prior year to be applied, the excess shall be

5 applied for the purposes and in the amounts per year described in

6 subdivisions (e) (3) (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this article, in

7 that order.

8 (4) In 2001 and in each succeeding year reductions equal to

9 or in excess of $40.5 million are projected to be available and

10 shall be applied as follows:

11 (i) If reductions are available in an amount that equals

12 or exceeds $40.5 million, $10 million of reductians shall be

13 apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and $30.5 million

14 of reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors. If

15 reductions are available in an amount greater than $40.5 million,

16 the excess shall be applied as provided in subdivision (e) (3) of

17 this article, subject however to subdivision (e) (1) .

18 (ii) If reductions are available in an amount less than

19 $40.5 million in any of these years, the reductions shall be divided

20 on a 24.7% 75.3% basis between the Agricultural Contractors and

21 the Urban Contractors respectively. Any such reductions not made

22 due to shortages shall be applied without interest in the next year

23 in which reductions in an amount in excess of $40.5 million are

24 available pursuant to subdivision (e) (3) of this article with any

25 remainder that is not available carried over without interest to be

26 applied in the earliest subsequent years when reductions in excess

27 of $40.5 million are available.

28

23 AR 012259

1 (5) Annual charges to a contractor shall only be reduced

2 prospectively from and after the date it executes the Monterey

3 Amendment to this contract. Apportionments of reductions shall be

4 calculated on the assumption that all contractors have executed such

5 amendment.

6 (e) Review of Financial Requirements

7 (1) In 2001 and every fifth year thereafter the Director of

8 the Department of Water Resources, in full consultation with the

9 contractors, will review the financial requirements of the State

10 Water Resources Development System and determine the following:

11 (i) The amount of revenues that are needed for State

12 Water Resources Development System purposes in addition to those

13 needed for the purposes specified in subdivisions (c) (2) (i), (ii),

14 (iii), and (iv) of this article;

15 (ii) If Che aggregate amount that would have been

16 charged to all contractors in any year but for this article exceeds

17 the sum of (A) the amount of revenues needed for the purposes

18 specified in subdivisions (c) (2) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), plus (B)

19 $40.5 million, plus (C) the amount determined pursuant to

20 subdivision (c)(2) (v) of this article, the amount of such excess.

21 (iii) The amount of the excess determined in subdivision

22 (e) (1) (ii) above that should be collected by the State for

23 additional State Water Resources Development System purposes and the

24 amount of such excess that should be used for further annual charge

25 reductions.

26 (2) After making the determinations required above, the State

27 may collect the revenues for additional State Water Resources

28

24 AR 012260

½

1 Development System purposes in the amount determined pursuant to

2 subdivision (e) (1) (iii) above.

3 (3) If and to the extent that as a result of such

4 determinations, the aggregate amount to be charged to contractors

5 is to be reduced by more than $40.5 million per year, the following

6 priorities and limitations shall apply with respect to the

7 application of such additional reductions:

8 (i) First, reductions shall be allocated to make up

9 shortfalls in reductions from those projected for the years 1997

10 through 2000 with interest at the project interest rate pursuant to

11 subdivision (d) (3) (i).

12 (ii) Second, reductions shall be allocated to make up

13 shortfalls in reductions from those projected for the years

14 beginning with 2001 without interest pursuant to subdivision

15 (d) (4) (ii) .

16 (iii) Third, additional reductions in the amount of $2

17 million per year shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors

18 until a total of $19.3 million in such additional reductions have

19 been so applied.

20 (iv) Fourth, reductions up to an additional $2 million

21 per year shall be allocated to make up any shortfalls in the annual

22 reductions provided for in subdivision (e) (3) (iii).

23 (v) Fifth, $2 million per year shall be charged and

24 collected by the State and deposited in the General Operating

25 Account to bring the account ultimately up to an amount determined

26 by the State but not in excess of $32 million with adjustments as

27 provided in subdivision (a) of this article. Any amount in the

28

25 AR 012261

1 account in excess of this requirement shall be returned to general

2 project revenues.

3 (vi) Sixth, remaining amounts if any shall be used for

4 reductions divided on a 24.7% - 75.3% basis between the Agricultural

5 Contractors and the Urban Contractors respectively.
(f) Apportionment of Reductions among Urban Contractors.

7 Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Urban Contractors under

8 subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be further allocated

9 among Urban Contractors pursuant to this subdivision. The amount

10 of reduction of annual charges for each Urban Contractor shall be

11 based on each Urban Contractor's proportionate share of total

12 allocated capital costs as calculated below, for both project

13 conservation and project transportation facilities, repaid by all

14 Urban Contractors over the project repayment period.

15 (1) The conservation capital cost component of the reduction

16 allocation shall be apportioned on the basis of maximum annual

17 entitlement. Each Urban Contractor's proportionate share shall be

18 the same as the percentage of that contractor's maximum annual

19 entitlement to the total of all Urban Contractors' maximum annual

20 entitlements.

21 (2) The transportation capital cost component Of the

22 reduction allocation shall be apportioned on the basis of

23 transportation capital cost component repayment obligations,

24 including interest over the project repayment period. Each Urban

25 Contractor's proportionate share shall be the same as the percentage

26 that the contractor's total transportation capital cost component

27 repayment obligation is of the total of all Urban Contractors'

28 transportation capital cost component repayment obligations.

26 AR 012262

1 (i) Recalculations shall be made annually through the

2 year 1999. Beginning in the year 2000 recalculations shall be made

3 every five years unless an Urban Contractor requests a recalculation

4 for an interim year and does so by a request in writing delivered

5 Co the Department by January 1 of the year in which the

6 recalculation is to take place.

7 (ii) The transportation capital cost component

8 repayment obligations, for purposes of this Article 51 (f), shall be

9 based in the year of recalculation on the then most recent

10 Department of Water Resources Bulletin 132, Table B-15, "Capital

11 Cost Component of Transportation Charge for Fach Contractor, " or its

12 equivalent, excluding any costs or entitlement associated with

13 transfers of entitlement from Agricultural Contractors pursuant to

14 Article 53.

15 (3) To reflect the relative proportion of the conservation

16 capital cost component and the transportation capital cost component

17 to the total of all capital cost repayment obligations, the two cost

18 components shall be weighted as follows:

19 (i) The conservation capital cost component shall be

20 weighted with a thirty percent (30%) factor. The weighting shall

21 be accomplished by multiplying each Urban Contractor's percentage

22 of maximum annual entitlements as calculated in subdivision (f) (1)

23 of this article by thirty percent (30%) .

24 (ii) The transportation capital cost component shall be

25 weighted with a seventy percent (70%) factor. The weighting shall

26 be accomplished by multiplying each Urban Contractor's percentage

27 of transportation capital cost component repayment obligations as

28

27 AR 012263

1 calculated in subdivision (f) (2) of this article by seventy percent
2 (70%).

3 (iii) A total, weighted capital cost percentage shall

4 be calculated for each Urban Contractor by adding the weighted

5 conservation capital cost component percentage to their weighted

6 transportation capital cost component percentage.

7 (4) The total amount of the annual charges to be reduced to

8 Urban Contractors in each year shall be allocated among them by

9 multiplying the total amount of annual charges to be reduced to the

10 Urban Contractors by the total, weighted capital cost percentages

11 for each such contractor. If the amount of the reduction to an

12 Urban Contractor is in excess of that contractor's payment

13 obligation to the Department for that year, such excess shall be

14 reallocated among the other Urban Contractors.

15 (5) In the case of a permanent transfer of urban entitlement,

16 the proportionate share of annual charge reductions associated with

17 that entitlement shall be transferred with the entitlement to the

18 buying contractor. In the case of an entitlement transfer by either

19 Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District

20 or San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation

21 District, the reductions in annual charges to that agency shall be

22 allocated (a) on the basis of that entitlement being retained by

23 that agency which bears Coastal Branch Phase II transportation

24 costs, (b) on the basis of that entitlement being retained by that

25 agency which does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II transportation

26 costs, and (c) on the basis of the balance of that agency' S

27 entitlement which also does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II

28 transportation costs.

28 AR 012264

1 (g) Apportionment of Reductions Among Agricultural
Contractors
2
(1) Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Agricultural
3 Contractors under subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be
4 allocated. among the Agricultural Contractors pursuant to this
5
subdivision. The amount of reduction of annual charges for each
6 Agricultural Contractor for the years 1997 through 2001 shall be
7 based on each Agricultural Contractor's estimated proportionate
8 share of the total project costs, excluding the variable operation,
9 maintenance, power and replacement components of the Delta Water
10 Charge and the Transportation Charge and also excluding off-aqueduct
11 power charges, to be paid by all Agricultural Contractors for the
12 years 1997 through 2035, calculated without taking into account this
13
article. For purposes of these calculations, Kern County Water
14 Agency's and Dudley Ridge Water District's estimated project costs
15 shall not include any costs associated with the 45,000 acre-feet of
16 annual entitlement being relinquished by those contractors pursuant
17
to subdivision (i) of Article 53. Also, for purposes of these
18 calculations, an Agricultural Contractor's estimated project costs
19 shall not be reduced by the transfer of any of the 130,000 acre-feet
20 of annual entitlements provided for in subdivisions (a) through (i)
21
of Article 53. The proportionate shares for 1997 through 2001
22 shall be calculated as follows:
23
(i) Each Agricultural Contractor's statement of charges
24 received on July 1, 1994, shall be the initial basis for calculating
25

26 the proportionate shares for the five years 1997 through 2001.
(ii) Each Agricultural Contractor's estimated capital
27
and minimum components of the Delta Water Charge and the
28

29 AR 012265

1 Transportation Charge (excluding off-aqueduct power charges) and

2 Water Revenue Bond Surcharge shall be totaled for the years 1997

3 through 2035.

4 (iii) Kern County Water Agency and Dudley Ridge Water

5 District totaled costs shall be reduced for the 45,000 acre-feet of

6 annual entitlement being relinquished by them.

7 (iv) Any reductions in an Agricultural Contractor's

: totaled costs resulting from the transfer of any of the 130,000

9 acre-feet of annual entitlement shall be re-added to that

10 contractor's costs.

11 (v) Each Agricultural Contractor's proportionate share

12 shall be computed by dividing that contractor's total costs by the

13 total costs for all Agricultural Contractors determined pursuant to
14 subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

15 (2) The reductions in annual charges, for 1997 through 2001,

16 shall be calculated using the method described in subdivision (g) (1)

17 of this article.

18 (3) The allocation shall be recalculated using the same

19 method described in subdivision (g) (1) of this article every five

20 years beginning in 2002, if any Agricultural Contractor requests

21 such a recalculation. Any recalculation shall be based on project

22 cost data beginning with the year that the recalculation is to

23 become effective through 2035.

24 (h) Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund

25 (1) Establishment. Through a trust agreement executed.

26 contemporaneously with this amendment, the State and the

27 Agricultural Contractors that sign the Monterey Amendments shall

28

30 AR 012266

1 establish the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund with a

2 mutually agreed independent trustee.

3 (2) Separate Accounts. The trustee shall maintain within the

4 trust fund a separate account for each Agricultural Contractor that

5 signs the trust agreement to hold deposits made pursuant to this

6 article.

7 (3) Deposits. Each Agricultural Contractor that signs the

8 trust agreement shall deposit into such contractor's account within

9 the trust fund, at the same time as payments would otherwise be

10 required by this contract to be made to the State, an amount equal

11 to the amount by which such contractor's charges under this contract

12 have been reduced by reason of this article, until the balance in

13 such contractor's account within the trust fund is the same

14 percentage of $150,000,000 as such contractor's percentage share of

15 reductions made available to all Agricultural Contractors as

16 specified in subdivision (g) of this article. In 2002 and every

17 fifth year thereafter, the Agricultural Contractors will review the

18 maximum accumulation in the trust fund (the "Cap") and determine

19 whether the cap should be adjusted. However, the Cap shall not be

20 reduced below an aggregate of $150,000,000 for all Agricultural

21 Contractor accounts.

22 (4) Trust Fund Disbursements.

23 (i) In any year in which the State's allocation of water

24 to an Agricultural Contractor by April 15th of that year is less

25 than one-hundred percent (100%) of the contractor's requested annual

26 entitlement for that year, the trustee shall, to the extent there

27 are funds in that contractor's account, distribute to the State from

28 such account for the benefit of that contractor an amount equal to

31 AR 012267

1 the percentage of the total of that contractor's statement of

2 charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on or about May

3 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b) the capital

4 cost and minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement

5 components of the Transportation Charge (including off-aqueduct

6 power charges) ; and (c) the water system revenue bond surcharge,

7 that is equal to the percentage of that contractor's annual

8 entitlement for that year that was not allocated to it by the State

9 by April 15th of that year.

10 (ii) In addition to the provisions of subdivision

11 (h) (4) (i) of this article, if on April 15 of any year any of the

12 irrigable land within the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District

13 (Tulare) is flooded, and Tulare in writing requests the trustee to

14 do so, the trustee shall, to the extent there are funds in Tulare's

15 account; distribute to the State from such account for the benefit

16 of Tulare an amount equal to the percentage of the total of Tulare's

17 statement of charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on

18 or about May 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b)

19 the capital cost and minimum components of the Transportation Charge

20 (including off-aqueduct power charges); and (c) the water system

21 revenue bond surcharge, that is equal to the percentage of the

22 irrigable land within Tulare that is flooded on April 15.

23 (iii) Each Agricultural Contractor shall remain

24 obligated to make payments to the State as required by other

25 articles in this contract. Any amount to be disbursed pursuant to

26 subdivisions (h) (4) (i) and (h) (4) (ii) shall be paid by the trustee

27 to the State on July 1 of the year involved and shall be credited

28 by the State toward any amounts owed by such respective Agricultural

32 AR 012268

1 Contractor to the State as of that date. However, an Agricultural

2 Contractor may direct the trustee to make the disbursement to that

3 Agricultural Contractor which shall in turn make the payment to the

4 State as required by other provisions of this contract. If the

5 amount to be disbursed exceeds the amount owed to the State by such

6 contractor as of July 1, the excess shall be disbursed by the

7 Trustee to the State at the time of and in payment of future

8 obligations owed to the State by such contractor. Alternatively,

9 upon the request of such contractor, all or part of the excess shall

10 be paid by the trustee to that contractor in reimbursement of prior

11 payments by the contractor to the State for that year.

12 (5) Payment of Supplemental Bills. In any year in which a

13 supplemental bill has been submitted to an Agricultural Contractor

14 pursuant to subdivision (c) (4) of this article, such supplemental

15 bill shall be treated as reducing by an equal amount the obligation

16 of such contractor for that year to make payments into the

17 Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund. To the extent that such

18 contractor has already made payments to the trust fund in an amount

19 in excess of such contractor's reduced trust fund payment

20 obligation, such contractor may request the trustee to use the

21 excess from the trust fund to pay the supplemental bill.

22 (6) Discharge of Payment Obligation. Fach payment to the

23 State by the trust fund shall discharge and satisfy the Agricultural

24 Contractor's obligation to pay the amount of such payment to the

25 State. No reimbursement of the trust fund by the Agricultural

26 Contractor for such payments shall be required. However, each

27 Agricultural Contractor shall continue to make deposits to the trust

28 fund matching the amount of each year's reductions as provided in

33 AR 012269

1 subdivision (d) of this article so long as the amount in that

2 contractor's account is less than its share of the Cap.

3 (7) Distribution of Funds in Excess of the Cap. Whenever

4 accumulated funds (including interest) in an Agricultural

5 Contractor's account in the trust fund exceed that contractor's

6 share of the Cap, or the estimated remaining payments the contractor

7 is required to make to the State prior to the end of the project

8 repayment period, that contractor may direct the trustee to pay such

9 excess to the contractor.

10 (8) Termination of Trust Fund. At the end of the project

11 repayment period, the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund shall

12 be terminated and any balances remaining in the accounts for each

13 of the Agricultural Contractors shall be disbursed to the respective

14 Agricultural Contractors.

15 (i) Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the

16 following definitions will apply:

17 (1) "Agricultural Contractor" shall mean the following

18 agencies as they now exist or in any reorganized form:

2 53. PERMANENT TRANSFERS AND REDUCTIONS OF ENTITLEMENT

3 (a) Article 41 provides that no assignment or transfer of

4 a contract or any part thereof, rights thereunder or interest

5 therein by a contractor shall be valid unless and until it is

6 approved by the State and made subject to such reasonable terms and

7 conditions as the State may impose. In accordance with State policy

8 to assist water transfers, the State and the County of Kings, Dudley
Ridge Water District (DRWD), Empire West Side Irrigation District,

10 Kern County Water Agency (KCWA), Oak Flat Water District and Tulare

11 Lake Basin Water Storage District (for the purposes of this article
12 the "Agricultural Contractors") shall, subject to the conditions set

13 forth in this article, expeditiously execute any necessary documents

14 and approve all contracts between willing buyers and willing sellers

15 until permanent transfers totaling 130,000 acre-feet of annual
16 entitlements of the Agricultural Contractors and, to the extent

17 provided in such contracts, rights in project transportation

18 facilities related to such annual entitlement have been made to

19 other contractors (the "Urban Contractors") or noncontractors in

20 accordance with the provisions of this article. Such approval

21 requirement shall apply to all contracts executed prior to January

22 1, 2011. KCWA shall be responsible for approval of such transfers

23 for any portion of the 130,000 acre-feet not previously made

24 available under this article by the other Agricultural Contractors.

25 A contract between a willing buyer and a willing seller shall mean

26 a contract between (1) a buyer which is an Urban Contractor or, to

27 the. extent provided in subdivision (e) of this article, a

28 noncontractor and (2) a seller which is an Agricultural Contractor

36 AR 012272

•

1 or a public entity which obtains project water from an Agricultural

2 Contractor.

3 (b) The State shall not be obligated to approve any transfer

4 of annual entitlements if in its judgment the transfer would impair

5 the security of the State's bondholders and the State may impose

6 conditions on any transfer as necessary to make the delivery of the
water operationally feasible and to assure that the transportation

8 costs associated with the transferred entitlement are fully repaid.
Transfers not approved by the State shall not be considered as part

10 of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in this

11 article.

12 (c) KCWA member units shall have 90 days to exercise a right

13 of first refusal to purchase any annual entitlements being offered

14 for sale to Urban Contractors by another KCWA member unit pursuant

15 to this article, other than those annual entitlements made available

16 to Urban Contractors by subdivision (d) of this article, by agreeing

17 to pay the same price offered by the buyer. Any such sales to KCWA

18 member units exercising such right of first refusal shall not be

19 considered a part of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements

20 provided for in this article.

21 (d) Any permanent transfers of annual entitlements by

22 Agricultural Contractors to noncontractors, including transfers to

23 KCWA urban member units or to KCWA's Improvement District Number 4,

24 other than transfers pursuant to subdivision (c) of this article,

25 will be considered a part of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual

26 entitlements provided for in this article if the Urban Contractors

27 have been given a right of first refusal to purchase such annual

28

37 AR 012273

1 entitlements as well as transportation rights in accordance with the

2 following terms and procedure:

(1) The Agricultural Contractor shall provide the State a

4 copy of a bona fide contract or Proposed Contract (the "Proposed

5 Contract") and the State shall, within five working days of receipt,

6 provide copies of such Proposed Contract to all Urban Contractors

7 together with a Notice of Proposed Contract stating the date on or

8 before which a Notice of Intent to Exercise a Right of First Refusal

9 (NOI) must be delivered to both the State and the seller, which date

10 shall be 90 days from the date the State mails the Notice of

11 Proposed Contract.

12 (2) The Proposed Contract shall provide for the transfer of

13 rights in project transportation facilities sufficient to deliver

14 to the seller's service area in any one month eleven percent (11%)

15 of the annual entitlement being transferred or such greater amount

16 as the seller determines to sell; Provided, however, that sellers

17 shall not be obligated to sell any transportation rights in the

18 Coastal Aqueduct.

19 (3) To- exercise the right of first refusal, an Urban

20 Contractor shall deliver to the State and the seller its NOI within

21 the time period stated in the Notice of Proposed Contract and shall

22 proceed in good faith to try to complete the transfer to the Urban

23 Contractor. If two or more Urban Contractors deliver NOI's to the

24 State, the amount of annual entitlement and transportation rights

25 being sold shall be allocated among those Urban Contractors that are

26 prepared to perform the purchase by the Performance Date provided

27 for herein in proportion to their maximum annual entitlements, or

28 in another manner acceptable to the Urban Contractors delivering the

38 AR 012274

1 NOIs. An offer by an Urban Contractor in its NOI to purchase less

2 than the entire annual entitlement and transportation right being

3 transferred shall not be deemed to be an effective exercise of the

4 right of first refusal unless other Urban Contractors submit NOIs

5 to purchase the remainder of the annual entitlement and

6 transportation right or the noncontractor buyer agrees to purchase

7 the remainder at the same unit price and on the same terms and

8 conditions provided for in the Proposed Contract. The Performance

9 Date shall be the date upon which the Urban Contractor is prepared

10 to perform the purchase, which date shall be the later of: (1) 180

11 days after the delivery of the NOI or (2) the date set forth in the

12 Proposed Contract for the noncontractor buyer to perform the

13 purchase.

14 The Performance Date shall be extended at the request of the

15 Urban Contractor if a temporary restraining order or preliminary

16 injunction is in effect as a result of a lawsuit challenging the

17 execution of the contract on the basis of noncompliance with the

18 California Environmental Quality Act. Such extensions shall

19 continue until five days after the temporary restraining order or

20 injunction expires or until the Urban Contractor requests it be

21 discontinued, whichever occurs first. The Urban Contractor shall

22 be liable for any damages suffered by the seller as a result of such

23 extensions of the Performance Date.

24 (4) If the seller and the noncontractor buyer under the

25 Proposed Contract make any substantive changes in the Proposed

26 Contract, such changes shall constitute a new Proposed Contract that

27 cannot be performed without compliance with all of the procedures

28 set forth in this article.

39 AR 012275

1 (5) If an Urban Contractor issuing a NOI fails to complete

2 its exercise of the Right of First Refusal by the Performance Date,

3 the seller shall be free to sell its entitlement in substantial

4 conformance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed

5 Contract An Urban Contractor issuing a NOI may assign its rights

6 to exercise a right of first refusal to another Urban Contractor and

7 the assignee shall have the same rights as the assignor to complete

8 the purchase by the Performance Date.

9 (6) In exercising the Right of First Refusal, an Urban

10 Contractor, at its option, may either agree to perform the Proposed

11 Contract in its entirety, including all of its terms and conditions,

12 or agree to pay the price offered under the Proposed Contract for

13 the annual entitlement and transportation rights without condition

14 and without being entitled to enforce or being subject to any other

15 provisions of the Proposed Contract.

16 (e) As used in this article, "price" shall mean the dollar

17 amount of consideration provided for in the Proposed Contract.

18 (f) Upon the effective date of any such transfer, the seller

19 shall be relieved of and the buyer shall become liable to the State

20 for all prospective Delta Water Charges, the related Transportation

21 Charges and any other charges for the .annual entitlements and

22 associated transportation rights transferred unless the seller and

23 buyer provide otherwise in the contract for the transfer and the

24 State approves such other provisions. However, the contractor

25 making the sale shall remain obligated to the State to make the

26 payments if the buyer defaults on its payments to the State related

27 to the water transferred and is not a party to a long term water

28 supply contract of the type contained in Department of Water

40 AR 012276

1 Resources Bulletin Number 141. If the contractor making the sale

2 is required to make any payments to the State as a result of the

3 buyer's default, the entitlement transferred to the defaulting buyer

4- shall, if provided for in the Proposed Contract, revert back to the

5 contractor making the sale. The buyer may also be liable for any

6 charges imposed pursuant to subdivision (g) of this article.

7 (g) A contractor which is a buyer of annual entitlement

8 pursuant to this article may receive deliveries using any portion

9 of the capacity previously provided by the State in each reach of

10 the project transportation facilities for such contractor that is

11 necessary for transporting the entitlement purchased by it on the

12 same basis as any other entitlement provided for in its Table A in

13 effect prior to the date of the Monterey Amendment. Such contractor

14 may also use any transportation rights transferred to it by a seller

15 in the same manner as the seller was entitled to use them and any

16 unused capacity in any of the reaches specified in this paragraph

17 so long as project operations and/or priority of service of water

18 to other contractors participating in repayment of capital costs in

19 such reaches is not adversely affected. The State shall not be

20 responsible for any resulting adverse impacts upon its ability to

21 provide such contractor peaking capacity. The capital cost and

22 minimum, operation, maintenance, power and replacement components

23 of the Transportation Charge allocated to a buying contractor

24 needing transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors

25 on which its charges are based in any reach shall be determined

26 prospectively based upon the increase in the buying contractor's

27 annual entitlement resulting from the purchase, and service of water

28 to fulfill annual entitlement to other contractors shall not be

41 AR 012277

1 impaired. The capital cost and minimum operation, maintenance,

2 power and replacement components of the Transportation Charges shall

then be reallocated among the other entities participating in

4 repayment of costs of that reach. For the purposes of this

5 determination, all payments received by the State from the seller

6 relating to the annual entitlement sold shall be deemed to have been

7 received from the buying contractor. Any increased Transportation

8 minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement component

9 charges allocated to the buying contractor pursuant to this

10 subdivision (g) shall begin January 1 of the year following the

11 effective date of the transfer.

12 (h) Individual contractors may transfer entitlements among

13 themselves in amounts in addition to those otherwise provided for

14 in this article. The State shall expeditiously execute any

15 necessary documents and approve all contracts involving permanent

16 sales of entitlements among contractors, including permanent sales

17 among Urban Contractors. Such sales shall be subject to the

18 provisions of subdivisions (b), (£) and (g) of this article;

19 Provided, however, that for a buying contractor needing

20 transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors on which

21 its charges are based in any reach, reallocation of the

22 Transportation capital cost component charges for transfers other

23 than' (i) the 130,000 acre-feet provided for in this article and (ii)

24 the approximate 33,000 acre-feet of transfers proposed from

25 contractors located in Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo counties,

26 shall be determined both prospectively and retroactively.

27 (i) On January 1 following the year in which such Monterey

28 Amendments take effect and continuing every year thereafter until

42 AR 012278

1 the end of the project repayment period: (i) Kern County Water

2 Agency's (KCWA) annual entitlement for agricultural use as currently

3 designated in Table A-1 of its contract shall be decreased by 40,670

4 acre-feet; (ii) Dudley Ridge Water District's (DRWD) annual

5 entitlement as currently designated in Table A of its contract shall

6 be decreased by 4,330 acre-feet; and (iii) the State's prospective

7 charges (including any adjustments for past costs) for the 45,000

8 acre-feet of annual entitlements to be relinquished by KCWA and DRWD

9 thereafter shall be deemed to be costs of project conservation

10 facilities and included in the Delta Water Charge for all

11 contractors in accordance with the provisions of Article 22. If by

12 November 20, 1995 and each October 1 thereafter until the Monterey

13 Amendments of both KCWA and DRWD take effect, KCWA and DRWD at their
2
14 option notify the State in writing that they will relinquish up to

15 their shares of 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements for the

16 following calendar year beginning before the Monterey Amendments

17 take effect, the State, when and if the Monterey Amendments take

18 effect, shall adjust the charges retroactively for the acre-feet
19 relinguished by KCWA and DRWD to January 1 of each year for which

20 water was relinquished. The delivery points for the 45,000

21 acre-feet of annual entitlement to be relinguished shall be

22 identified for the State by KCWA and DRWD to enable the State to

23 calculate the transportation costs for the 45,000 acre-feet to be

24 included in the Delta Water Charge.

2 54. Usage of Lakes Castaic and Perris
(a) The State shall permit the contractors participating in

4 repayment of the capital costs of Castaic Lake (Reach 30) and Lake

5 Perris (Reach 28J) to withdraw water from their respective service

6 connections in amounts in excess of deliveries approved pursuant to

7 other provisions of the state water contracts. Each such contractor

8 shall be permitted to withdraw up to a Maximum Allocation from the

9 reach in which it is participating. The contractors participating

10 in repayment of Castaic Lake may withdraw a collective Maximum

11 Allocation up to 160,000 acre-feet pursuant to this article, which

12 shall be apportioned among them pursuant to the respective

13 proportionate use factors from the Department of Water Resources'

14 Bulletin 132-94, Table B-1 upon which capital cost repayment

1 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, as

2 the only contractor participating in repayment of Lake Perris,

3 shall be allocated a Maximum Allocation at Lake Perris of 65,000

4 acre-feet based upon a proportionate use factor of 1.00000000.

5 The Maximum Allocation totals of 160,000 acre-feet and

6 65,000 acre-feet shall not be subject to adjustment. The

7 individual contractor's Maximum Allocations shall be adjusted

8 only as agreed to among the contractors desiring to adjust their

9 Maximum Allocations. Adjustments between the contractors shall

10 be subject to approval of the State which approval shall be given

11 unless there are adverse impacts upon another contractor

12 participating in the reach which are unacceptable to such

13 contractor. The participating contractors will, in consultation

14 with the State, cooperate with each other in an effort to promote

15 efficient utilization of Castaic Lake, and to minimize any

16 adverse impacts to each other, through coordination of deliveries

17 pursuant to other provisions of the State Water Contract as well

18 as withdrawals of allocations pursuant to this article.

19 (b) The State shall operate Castaic and Perris Reservoirs

20 as transportation facilities in a manner consistent with this

21 article. A contractor desiring to withdraw a portion or all of

22 its Maximum Allocation shall furnish the State with a proposed

23 delivery schedule. The proposed schedule may be submitted as

24 part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted

25 pursuant to Article 12(a) (1). Upon receipt of a schedule the

26 State shall promptly review it to ensure that the amounts, times

27 and rates of delivery will be consistent with the State's ability

28 to operate the reach. The contractor may modify its proposed

45 AR 012281

1 delivery schedule at any time, and the modified schedule shall be

2 subject to review in the same manner. If necessary, the State

3 may modify the schedule after consultation with the contractor

4 and other contractors participating in repayment of that reach

5 but may not change the total quantity of water to be withdrawn.

6 As part of the consultation, the State shall advise a contractor

7 if it determines a withdrawal will adversely impact the rate of

8 delivery provided for the contractor in this contract. The State

9 shall not be responsible for any such impacts.

10 (c) A contractor may withdraw all or a portion of its

11 Maximum Allocation. It shall restore any withdrawn portion of

12 such allocation by furnishing an equivalent amount of replacement

13 water to the reservoir from which the water was withdrawn within

14 five years from the year in which the withdrawal takes place. The

15 unused portion of the allocation, in addition to any replacement

16 water furnished to the reservoir, shall remain available for

17 subsequent withdrawal. The State shall keep an accounting of the

18 contractor's storage withdrawals and replacements. In any year,

19 the State shall permit a contractor to withdraw an amount

20 equivalent to the contractor's Maximum Allocation minus remaining

21 replacement water requirements due to previous withdrawals. If

22 the contractor fails to schedule and replace the withdrawn water

23 within the five-year return period, the State shall provide the

24 replacement water from water scheduled for delivery to the

25 contractor in the sixth year or as soon as possible thereafter.

27 Allocation.

28

47 AR 012283

1 A contractor may use any of this total amount for

2 replacement water but cannot use any more than that provided for

3 in Article 56 to add to storage in project surface conservation

4 facilities and in nonproject surface storage facilities. There

shall be no limit under this article on the amount of scheduled
annual entitlement a contractor can use to restore its Maximum
Allocation in a year when its percentage of annual water supply

8 allocation is one-hundred percent (100%), nor shall there be any

9 limit under this article on the amount of interruptible water,

10 nonproject water or water obtained through an exchange which a

11 contractor can use to restore its Maximum Allocation.

12 (d) For any replacement water furnished to reservoir

13 storage pursuant to this article, the responsible contractor

14 shall pay the State charges for the conservation, if any, and

15 transportation of such replacement water as are associated with

16 the type of replacement water that is furnished, as if such water

17 were delivered to the turnout at the reservoir to which the

18 replacement water is furnished. Adjustments from estimated to

19 actual costs shall be subject to provisions applicable to the

20 type of replacement water. The State shall not charge

21 contractors for water withdrawn pursuant to this article.

22 (e) The State shall operate capacity in Castaic and Perris

23 Reservoirs, not required for purposes of Maximum Allocation

24 deliveries, in compliance with the requirement of Article 17(b)

25 of The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's water

26 supply contract with the State to maintain an amount of water

27 reasonably sufficient to meet emergency requirements of the

28 contractors participating in repayment of that reach. A

48 AR 012284

1 contractor receiving water pursuant to this article accepts that

2 the State shall not be liable for any damage, direct or indirect,

3 arising from shortages in the amount of water to be made

4 available from that reservoir to meet the contractor's actual

5 emergency requirements as a result of prior storage withdrawals

6 by that contractor pursuant to this article. Nothing in this
article shall permit or require the State to adjust allocations

or deliveries under Article 18.

9 (f) To the extent a contractor, during a calendar year,

10 uses all or a portion of its Maximum Allocation, the State may,

11 to the extent necessary to service project purposes, reduce that

12 contractor's requested peaking service. Such reduction in

13 peaking service shall only occur to the extent such usage of

14 Maximum Allocation causes the State to be unable to provide all

15 peaking service requested. This paragraph shall not apply to the

16 extent the contractor requested usage of Maximum Allocation as

17 part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted

18 pursuant to Article 12 (a) (1).

19 (g) The State may reduce water stored in Castaic Lake and

20 Lake Perris to the extent necessary for maintenance and to

21 respond to emergencies resulting from failure of project

22 transportation facilities or of other supply importation

23 facilities serving the State project servi.ce area. The State

24 shall promptly replace water within the Maximum Allocation as

25 soon as the need for the reduction terminates.

49 AR 012285

1 26. Article 55 is added to read:

2 55. Transportation of Nonproject Water

3 (a) Subject to the delivery priorities in Article 12(E),

4 contractors shall have the right to receive services from any of

5 the project transportation facilities to transport water procured

6 by them from nonproject sources for delivery to their service

7 areas and to interim storage outside their service areas for

8 later transport and delivery to their service areas: Provided,

9 that except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the

10 Water Code be changed, a contractor shall not use the project

11 transportation facilities under this option to transport water

12 the right to which was secured by the contractor through eminent

13 domain unless such use be approved by the Legislature by

14 concurrent resolution with the majority of the members elected co

15 each house voting in favor thereof.

16 (b) For any nonproject water delivered pursuant to this

17 article, contractors shall pay the State the same (including

18 adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct,

19 off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the conservation

20 and transportation of such water as if such nonproject water were

21 entitlement water, as well as all incremental operation,

22 maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental

23 costs, which may include an administrative or contract

24 preparation charge, all as determined by the State. Incremental

25 costs shall mean those nonpower costs which would not be incurred

26 if nonproject water were not scheduled for or delivered to

27 contractors. Only those contractors not participating in the

28 repayment of a reach hall be required to pay a use of facilities

50 AR 012286

1 charge for the delivery of nonproject water from or through that

2 reach. Costs for transporting water placed into interim storage

3 shall be paid in the same manner provided for in subdivision

4. (c) (6) of Article 56.

5 (C) The amounts, times and rates of delivery of nonproject

6 water shall be provided for pursuant to a water delivery schedule

7 to be issued in the same manner as provided for in Article 12.

8 The costs specified in this article shall be paid for at the same

9 time the corresponding project water costs are paid.

10

11 27. Article 56 is added to read:

12 56. Use, Storage and Sale of Project Water Outside of Service Area and Storage of Water in Project Surface
13 Conservation Facilities

14 (a) State Consent to Use of Project Water Outside of Service Area
15 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15(a), the State
16 hereby consents to the Agency storing project water outside its
17 service area for later use within its service area in accordance
18 with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this article and to the
19 Agency selling project water for use outside its service area in
20 accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d) of this
21
article.
22
(b) Groundwater Storage Programs
23 The Agency shall cooperate with other contractors in the
24 I development and establishment of groundwater storage programs.
25
(c) Storage of Project Water Outside of Service Area
26
(1) A contractor may elect to store project water outside
27 its service area for later use within its service area, up to the
28

51 AR 012287

1 limits and in accordance with the provisions provided for in this

2 subdivision (c) and any applicable water right laws, by setting

3 forth on the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted to the

4 State on or before October 1 of each year pursuant to Article

5 12 (a) the quantity of project water it wishes to store in the

6 next succeeding year. There shall be no limit on the amount of

7 project water a contractor can store outside its service area

8 during any year in a then existing and operational groundwater

9 storage program. The amount of project water a contractor can

10 add to storage in project surface conservation facilities and in

11 nonproject surface storage facilities located outside the

12 contractor's service area each year shall be limited to the

13 lesser of the percent of the contractor's Table A annual

14 entitlement shown in column 2 or the acre-feet shown in column 3

15 of the following table, depending on the State's final water

16 supply allocation percentage as shown in column 1. However,

17 there shall be no limit to storage in nonproject facilities in a

18 year in which the State's final water supply allocation

19 percentage is one hundred percent. These limits shall not apply

20 to water stored pursuant to Article 12 (e).

1 (2) Storage capacity in project surface conservation

2 facilities at any time in excess of that needed for project

3 operations shall be made available to requesting contractors for

4 storage of project and nonproject water. If such storage

5 requests exceed the available storage capacity, the available

6 capacity shall be allocated among contractors requesting storage

7 in proportion to their annual entitlements designated in their

8 Table A's for that year. A contractor may store water in excess

9 of its allocated share of capacity as long as capacity is

10 available for such storage.

11 (3) If the State determines that a reallocation of excess

12 storage capacity is needed as a result of project operations or

13 because of the exercise of a contractor's storage right, the

14 available capacity shall be reallocated among contractors

15 requesting storage in proportion to their annual entitlements

16 designated in their Table A's for that year. IE such

17 reallocation results in the need to displace water from the

18 storage balance for any contractor or noncontractor, the water to

19 be displaced shall be displaced in the following order of

20 priority:

21 First, water, if any, stored för noncontractors.

22 Second, water stored for a contractor that previously was in

23 excess' of that contractor's allocation of storage capacity.

24 Third, water stored for a contractor that previously was

25 within that contractor's allocated storage capacity.

26 The State shall give as much notice as feasible of a

27 potential displacement.

28

54 AR 012290

1 (4) Any contractor electing to store project water outside

2 its service area pursuant to this subdivision may not sell

3 project water under the provisions of subdivision (d) of this

4 article during the year in which it elected to store project

5 water. This limitation shall not apply to replacement water

6 furnished to Castaic and Perris Reservoirs pursuant to Article

7 54, nor to the storage of water introduced into a groundwater

8 basin outside a contractor's service area if recovery is intended

9 to occur within that contractor's service area.

10 (5) The restrictions on storage of project water outside a

11 contractor's service area provided for in this subdivision (c),

12 shall not apply to storage in any project offstream storage

13 facilities constructed south of the Delta after the date of this

14 amendment.

15 (6) For any project water stored outside its service area

16 pursuant to this subdivision (c), a contractor shall pay the

17 State the same (including adjustments) for power resources

18 (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power)

19 incurred in the transportation of such water as the contractor

20 pays for the transportation of annual entitlement to the reach of

21 the project transportation facility from which the water is

22 delivered to storage. If annual entitlement is stored, the Delta

23 Water Charge shall be charged only in the year of delivery to

24 interim storage. For any stored water returned to a project

25 transportation facility for final delivery to its service area,

26 the contractor shall pay the State the same for power resources

27 (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power)

28 incurred in the transportation of such water calculated from the

55 AR 012291

1 point of return to the aqueduct to the turn-out in the

2 contractor's service area. In addition, the contractor shall pay

3 all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs,

4 and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State,

5 which shall not include any administrative or contract

6 preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower

7 costs which would not be incurred if such water were scheduled

8 for or delivered to the contractor's service area instead of to

9 interim storage outside the service area. Only those contractors

10 not participating in the repayment of a reach shall be required

11 to pay a use of facilities charge for use of a reach for the

12 delivery of water to, or return of water from, interim storage.

13 (7) A contractor electing to store project water in a

14 nonproject facility within the service area of another contractor

15 shall execute a contract with that other contractor prior to

16 storing such water which shall be in conformity with this article

17 and will include at least provisions concerning the point of

18 delivery and the time and method for transporting such water.

19 (d) Sale of Project Water For Use Outside Service Area

20 (1) If in any year a contractor has been allocated annual

21 entitlement that it will not use within its service area, the

22 contractor has not elected to store project water in accordance

23 with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this article during

24 that year, and the contractor has not elected to carry over

25 entitlement water from the prior year pursuant to the provisions

26 of Article 12 (e), the contractor may sell such annual

27 entitlement for use outside its service area in accordance with

28 the following provisions.

56 AR 012292

1 (2) Each year the State shall establish an annual

2 entitlement water pool (the Pool) for contractors wishing to sell

3 or buy project water pursuant to the provisions of this

4 subdivision. The Pool shall constitute the exclusive means of

5 selling portions of annual entitlements not desired by

6 contractors that year. Contractors willing to sell to or buy

7 water from the Pool shall notify the State in writing of their

8 desire to do so indicating the quantity to be sold or purchased.

9 Contractors shall have the first priority to purchase all water

10 placed in the Pool. The State may purchase any water remaining

11 in the Pool not purchased by contractors at the same price

12 available tO contractors and use such water for the purpose of

13 providing additional carryover storage for contractors: Provided,

14 that the State shall consult with the contractors prior to making

15 any such purchases.

16 (3) Each year, the price per acre-foot to be paid by the

17 State to contractors selling water placed in the Pool on or

18 before February 15 that is purchased by a contractor requesting

19 such purchase by March 1 or by the State on March 1 shall be

20 equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Delta water rate as of that

21 date. The price per acre-foot to be paid to the State for the

M Dear Mr. Clark:
As discussed among our staff, enclosed for your records is a revised copy of EXHIBIT A to the "Amendment No. 26 to Water Supply Contract Between the State of California, Department of Water Resources and Kern County Water Agency," dated November 15, 1963. EXHIBIT A is referenced in section 7 of the Amendment. The "Existing Annual Entitlement" column (column 1) values for Reaches 14A and 14B have been changed from 241,755 and 204,255 to 275,755 and 238,255 respectively. This change is being made to correct a mathematical error. In addition, language was added to Footnotes 3 and 4 to reference Article 53 of Kern's long-term Water Supply Contract and Footnote 5 was added to clarify that Kern retains its right to use the transportation capacity associated with the 40,670 acre-feet Kern relinquished. If you concur with these changes, please replace the existing EXHIBIT A with the revised version enclosed and sign and date the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me at State Water Project Analysis Office, Department of Water Resources, State of California, Post Office Box 942836, Sacramento, California 84236-0001.

shall be attributable to Zone 7 as if the Zone 7's annual entitlement

and the related transportation capacity had been increased by the

7,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement purchased from the Agency in

years prior to January 1, 2000.

(d) For cost allocation and repayment purposes, Exhibit A attached

hereto shows entitlement and capacity amounts for each aqueduct

reach in which the Agency participates consistent with the limits of

derive the proportionate use of facilities factors as set forth in Table B

as designated in Article 24(b). The capacity amounts shown in

Exhibit A are estimated values. Actual values will be used by the

State in implementing the terms of this Amendment and in

redetermination of Table B of this contract under Article 28.

shall commence January 1, 2001, and be identified by the State

and included in a revised Statement of Charges for the year

2001 and in future annual Statement of Charges to the Agency.

(b) Recognizing Reach 31A of the Coastal Branch of the California
Aqueduct will not be used for delivery of any of the 4,025 acre-feet of
annual entitlement purchased from the Agency, effective January 1,
2001, the Agency is relieved of and the District is liable to the State for
all prospective Delta Water Charges, Transportation Charges, and the
Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge for Reach 31A related to the
applicable portion of the 4,025 acre-feet of annual entitlement
purchased from the Agency. However, the Agency shall retain the
right to use the transportation capacity in Reach 31A associated with
the 4,025 acre-feet being transferred. For delivery of water to the
Agency in Reach 31A, the Agency shall remain responsible for any
applicable portion of the variable operation, maintenance, power, and
replacement component of the Transportation Charge and any
applicable portion of the Off-Aqueduct Power Facilities Charge of the

(d) For cost allocation and repayment purposes, Exhibit A attached
hereto shows entitlement and capacity amounts for each aqueduct
reach in which the Agency participates consistent with the limits of
Articles 12(b) and 12(c). These redetermined values shall be used to
derive the proportionate use of facilities factors as set forth in Table B
as designated in Article 24(b). The capacity amounts shown in
Exhibit A are estimated values. Actual values will be used by the

State in implementing the terms of this Amendment and in

redetermination of Table B of this contract under Article 28.

4. This Amendment is contingent upon the effectiveness of Water Supply Contract

Amendment No. 21, between the State and the District. If either amendment ceases

State of California
The Resources Agency DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

AMENDMENT NO. 35 TO THE WATER SUPPLY CONTRACT
BETWEEN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES
AND
KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY

This Amendment is made this d+A day of Máy 2003,

pursuant to the provisions of the California Water Resources Development Bond Act,
the Central Valley Project Act, and other applicable laws of the State of California,
between the State of California, acting by and through its Department of Water

Resources, hereinafter referred to as the "State," and Kern County Water Agency,

hereinafter referred to as the "Agency."

RECITALS

A. The State and the Agency entered into and subsequently amended a water
supply contract (the "contract") providing that the State shall supply certain
quantities of water to the Agency and providing that the Agency shall make
certain payments to the State, and setting forth the terms and conditions of such

supply and such payments.

B. On December 1, 1994, the State and representatives of certain State Water
Project contractors executed a document entitled "Monterey Agreement -
Statement of Principles - By The State Water Contractors And The State Of

1
AR 012387

»NERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

California Department Of Water Resources For Potential Amendments To The
State Water Supply Contracts" (the "Monterey Agreement").

C. The State, the Central Coast Water Authority ("CCWA") and those contractors
intending to be subject to the Monterey Agreement subsequently negotiated an
amendment to their contracts to implement provisions of the Monterey
Agreement, and such amendment was named the "Monterey Amendment."

D. In October 1995, an environmental impact report ("EIR") for the Monterey
Amendment was completed and certified by CCWA as the lead agency, and
thereafter the Agency and the State executed the Monterey Amendment.

E. The EIR certified by the CCWA was challenged by several parties (the
"Plaintiffs") in the Sacramento County Superior Court and thereafter in the Third
District Court of Appeal, resulting in a decision in Planning and Conservation
League, et al. v. Department of Water Resources, 83 Cal.App.4bh 892 (2000),
which case is hereinafter referred to as "PCL v. DWR."

F. In its decision, the Court of Appeal held that (i) the Department of Water
Resources ("DWR"), not CCWA, had the statutory duty to serve as lead agency,
(ii) the trial court erred by finding CCWA's EIR sufficient despite its failure to
discuss implementation of Article 18, subdivision (b) of the State Water Project
contracts, as a no-project alternative, (ii) said errors mandate preparation of a
new EIR under the direction of DWR, and (iv) the trial court erroneously
dismissed the challenge to DWR's transfer of title to certain lands to Kern County

2
AR 012388

NERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

Water Agency (the "Validation Cause of Action") and execution of amended State

Water Project contracts for failure to name and serve indispensable parties. The

Court of Appeal remanded the case to the trial court, ordering it to take the

following five actions: (1) vacate the trial court's grant of the motion for summary

adjudication of the Validation Cause of Action; (2) issue a writ of mandate

vacating the certification of the EIR; (3) determine the amount of attorney fees to
be awarded Plaintiffs; (4) consider such orders it deems appropriate under Public

Resources Code Section 21168.9(a) consistent with the views expressed in the
Appellate Court's opinion; and (5) retain jurisdiction over the action until DWR, as
lead agency, certifies an environmental impact report in accordance with CEQA
standards and procedures, and the Superior Court determines that such

environmental impact report meets the substantive requirements of CEQA.

G. The State, the contractors, and the Plaintiffs in PCL v. DWR reached an
agreement to settle PCL v. DWR, as documented by that certain Settlement

Agreement dated MAY 0 5 2043 2003 (the "Settlement Agreement"),

and in such Settlement Agreement have agreed that the contracts should be

amended, for clarification purposes, to delete terms such as "annual entitlement"

and "maximum annual entitlement" so that the public, and particularly land use

planning agencies, will better understand the contracts.

H. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the State and the Agency desire to so
amend the Agency's contract, with the understanding and intent that the
amendments herein with respect to subsections (k), (I), and (m) of Article 1,

3
AR 012389

NERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

subsection (b) of Article 6, and subsection (a) of Article 16, and to Table A of the
Agency's contract are solely for clarification purposes and that such amendments
are not intended to and do not in any way change the rights, obligations or
limitations on liability of the State or the Agency established by or set forth in the

contract.

I. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the State, the contractors and the
Plaintiffs in PCL v. DWR also agreed that the contracts should be amended to

include a new Article 58 addressing the determination of dependable annual

supply of State Water Project water to be made available by existing Project
facilities, and the State and Agency desire to SO amend the Agency's contract.

NOW THEREFORE, IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED, as follows:

1. Article 1 (l) is amended to read:

(I) Annual Table A Amount

"Annual Table A Amount" shall mean the amount of project water set forth in
Table A of this contract that the State, pursuant to the obligations of this contract
and applicable law, makes available for delivery to the Agency at the delivery
structures provided for the Agency. The term Annual Table A Amount shall not

be interpreted to mean that in each year the State will be able to make that
quantity of project water available to the Agency. The Annual Table A Amounts

and the terms of this contract reflect an expectation that under certain conditions

the Agency will receive its full Annual Table A Amount; but that under other

4
AR 012390

nERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY AMENDMENT NO. 35

conditions only a lesser amount, allocated in accordance with this contract, may
be made available to the Agency. This recognition that full Annual Table A

Amounts will not be deliverable under all conditions does not change the

obligations of the State under this contract, including but not limited to, the
obligations to make all reasonable efforts to complete the project facilities, to
perfect and protect water rights, and to allocate among contractors the supply
available in any year, as set forth in Articles 6(b), 6(c), 16(b) and 18, in the
manner and subject to the terms and conditions of those articles and this
contract. Where the term "annual entitlement" appears elsewhere in this
contract, it shall mean "Annual Table A Amount." The State agrees that in future
amendments to this and other contractor's contracts, in lieu of the term "annual

entitlement," the term "Annual Table A Amount" will be used and will have the
same meaning as "annual entitlement" wherever that term is used.

2. Article 1(m) is amended to read:

(m) Maximum Annual Table A Amount

"Maximum annual entitlement" shall mean the maximum annual amounts set

forth in Table A of this contract, and where the term "maximum annual

entitlement" appears elsewhere in this contract it shall mean "Maximum Annual it

Table A Amounts."

5
AR 012391

nERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

3. Article 1(k) is amended to read:

(k) Minimum Project Yield

"Minimum project yield" shall mean the dependable annual supply of project
water to be made available assuming completion of the initial project
conservation facilities and additional project conservation facilities. The project's
capability of providing the minimum project yield shall be determined by the State
on the basis of coordinated operations studies of initial project conservation
facilities and additional project conservation facilities, which studies shall be
based upon factors including but not limited to: (1) the estimated relative
proportion of deliveries for agricultural use to deliveries for municipal use
assuming Maximum Annual Table A Amounts for all contractors and the
characteristic distributions of demands for these two uses throughout the year;
and (2) agreements now in effect or as hereafter amended or supplemented
between the State and the United States and others regarding the division of
utilization of waters of the Delta or streams tributary thereto.

4. Article 6(b) is amended to read:

(b) Agency's Annual Table A Amounts

Commencing with the year of initial water delivery to the Agency, the State each
year shall make available for delivery to the Agency the amounts of project water

6
AR 012392

NERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

designated in Table A of this contract, which amounts shall be subject to change
as provided for in Article 7(a) and are referred to in this contract as the Agency's

Annual Table A Amounts.

5. Article 16(a) is amended to read:

(a) Limit on Total of all Maximum Annual Table A Amounts

The Agency's Maximum Annual Table A Amount hereunder, together with the
maximum Table A amounts of all other contractors, shall aggregate no more than
4,185,000 acre-feet of project water.

6. Article 57 is intentionally left blank for future use.

7. Article 58 is added to read:

58. Determination of Dependable Annual Supply of Project Water to be Made
Available by Existing Project Facilities.

In order to provide current information regarding the delivery capability of existing
project conservation facilities, commencing in 2003 and every two years
thereafter the State shall prepare and mail a report to all contractors, and all
California city, county, and regional planning departments and agencies within
the contractors' project service areas. This report will set forth, under a range of

hydrologic conditions, estimates of overall delivery capability of the existing
project facilities and of supply availability to each contractor in accordance with
other provisions of the contractors' contracts. The range of hydrologic conditions
shall include the delivery capability in the driest year of record, the average over

7
AR 012393

NERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY
AMENDMENT NO. 35

the historic extended dry cycle and the average over the long-term. The biennial
report will also include, for each of the ten years immediately preceding the
report, the total amount of project water delivered to all contractors and the
amount of project water delivered to each contractor.

8. Add the following language at the bottom of Table A:

In any year, the amounts designated in this Table A shall not be interpreted to
mean that the State is able to deliver those amounts in all years. Article 58
describes the State's process for providing current information for project delivery

capability.

9. Add the following language at the bottom of Table A-1:

In any year, the amounts designated in this Table A-1 shall not be interpreted to

mean that the State is able to deliver those amounts in all years. Article 58
describes the State's process for providing current information for project delivery

capability.

10. Except for Article 58, the changes made by this amendment are solely for

clarification purposes, and are not intended to nor do they in any way change the

rights, obligations or limitations on liability of the State or the Agency established

by or set forth in the contract, and this amendment shall be interpreted in

accordance with this intent.
