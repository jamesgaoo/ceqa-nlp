VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Petitioner and Plaintiff DOHENY-VIDOVICH PARTNERS, a California General Partnership,
2 alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Through this action, Petitioner and Plaintiff DOHENY-VIDOVICH PARTNERS, a
California General Partnership (Petitioner), seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as
6 alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding Respondents and Defendants CITY OF LOS
7 ALTOS, a California general law municipality; CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LOS ALTOS, a
8 governing body; CITY OF LOS ALTOS PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, a
9 public body; CITY OF LOS ALTOS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, a division of
10 the CITY OF LOS ALTOS (collectively, the City) to enforce the Los Altos Municipal Code (City
11 Code), and the conditions of approval placed on Use Permit No. 2016-UP-02 (Conditions of Approval),
12 applied for by Real Parties in Interest Jeff Taylor (Applicant) and LOLA, LLC (LOLA) (collectively,
13 Real Parties). Petitioner also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and alternative and peremptory
14 writs of mandate commanding the Community Development Department to rescind its improper,
15 underground approval of substantive project changes to the development plans approved by the City
16| Council along with Use Permit No. 2016-UP-02 and Building Permit No. 2016-667756 in violation of
17 the City Code, the Conditions of Approval, and the California Environmental Quality Act (Public
18 Resources Code section 21000 et seq.) (CEQA).
19 2. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that the City, through the
20 Community Development Department, has allowed Real Parties to make substantive project changes to
21 Use Permit No. 2016-UP-02, Building Permit No. 2016-667756, and the development plans originally
22 approved by the City Council on September 13, 2016 for Real Parties' multi-family residential
23 development located at 4880 El Camino Real, in the City of Los Altos (Project). Specifically, the City

24 recently allowed Real Parties to revise the development plans to remove the battery backup system
25 publicly approved by the City Council and add a diesel-powered, backup generator on the roof of the
26 Project without the public review and mitigation required by CEQA and the Conditions of Approval,
27 even though the City's 2016 approval documents admit that diesel generators are sources of air
28 pollution, including Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) and noise, both of which would impact adjacent
2
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

sensitive receptors. In fact, the City's 2016 noise and air quality studies specifically found that the
2 Project would not have significant air quality and noise impacts because the Project would not include a

3 gencrator.

4 3. The Conditions of Approval require that substantive project changes be presented to the

5 City through a formal amendment to the Project application with review by the Planning and
Transportation Commission and City Council. The Conditions of Approval also require the final project

7 design to incorporate, and for Real Parties to implement all mitigation for noise and air quality impacts
8 recommended in the air quality and noise studies performed for the Project. By adding the rooftop

9 diesel generator long after the City's approval of the final project design, and without formally
10 amending the application for Planning and Transportation Commission and City Council review, Real
11 Parties are in violation of the Conditions of Approval.

12 4. Moreover, "[t]he lack of public notice that the agency had authorized these substantial
13 changes compromise the goal of public participation in the environmental review process." (Concerned
14 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 938.) By allowing
15 Real Parties to revise the development plans to remove the battery backup system and add the rooftop
16 diesel generator, after specifically concluding that the Project would not have operational impacts due
17 to the absence of a generator, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and violated CEQA.

18 5. The City has a ministerial duty to enforce the Conditions of Approval, and the authority
19 to stop construction of the Project and require Real Parties to correct the violations, including removal
20 of the rooftop diesel generator. The City must exercise its authority and enforce the Conditions of
21 Approval by requiring Real Parties to remove the generator and formally amend the Project application

22 so that the admitted adverse environmental impacts of the generator can be adequately studied and
23 mitigated, and publicly reviewed by the Planning and Transportation Commission and City Council.

24 6. Petitioner respectfully seeks a writ of mandate commanding the City to: 1) rescind the
25 Community Development Department's signoff on the revisions to the development plans removing the
26 battery backup system and adding the rooftop generator; 2) remove the generator and related

27 infrastructure from the roof of the Project; and 3) enforce the Conditions of Approval on Real Parties
28 for this and any other change to the approved development plans.
3
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 7. Petitioner also seeks a declaration that the City's improper, underground approval of
2 substantive project changes in the form of the rooftop diesel generator, without requiring compliance
3 with the Conditions of Approval, violated the rights of Petitioner and the Public, as enshrined in the
4 City Code and the Planning and Zoning law.

5 8. Lastly, Petitioner prays for appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the City and/or Real
6 Parties from taking further action to implement or proceed with the Project or make additional
7 substantive project changes during the pendency of this litigation and prior to complying with the
8 Conditions of Approval, City Code, and CEQA.

9 PARTIES

10 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff DOHENY-VIDOVICH PARTNERS, is partnership organized
11 and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is the owner of real property located
12 immediately adjacent to the Project. Petitioner's property is currently improved with a single-family
13 residence at 856 Jordan Avenue and a Jack in the Box restaurant at 4896 El Camino Real in the City of
14 Los Altos. The health and safety of Petitioner and its tenants and customers, who live and work within
15 the Project area, will be directly affected by the substantive project changes, which will cause
16 significant adverse impacts, including air quality and noise impacts. The health and safety of Petitioner,
17| its tenants, and customers will therefore be significantly impacted by the operational air quality and
18 noise effects of the rooftop diesel generator, including the lack of adequate mitigation required by the
19 Conditions of Approval. As members of the public, moreover, Petitioner, its tenants and customers
20| possess an interest in protecting public resources present in the area, including air quality. The interests
21 of Petitioner will be directly impacted by the operation of the rooftop diesel generator. Petitioner is
22 suing on its behalf, and on behalf of those similarly situated who will be adversely affected by the
23 operation of the rooftop diesel generator in the Project area, as well as for citizens more broadly,
24 including those who seek to maintain the integrity and fairness of the environmental review and land
25 use entitlement process.

26 10. Respondent CITY OF LOS ALTOS is a municipality governed by the laws of the State
27 of California and is a political subdivision thereof, located in the County of Santa Clara.

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

11. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LOS ALTOS is the elected governing
2 body of the City, and is the body ultimately responsible for the actions at issue herein.

3 12. Respondent CITY OF LOS ALTOS PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION
4 COMMISSION is a government body appointed to review and make recommendations on planning
5 and transportation actions, including those at issue herein.

6 13. Respondent CITY OF LOS ALTOS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT
7 is a division of the City responsible for the processing and review of development, planning, and
8 permitting decisions made by the City, including those at issue herein.

14. is Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest
10 LOLA, LLC is and at all times relevant herein was, a limited liability company authorized by and
11 existing under the laws of the State of California.

12 15. Real Party in Interest Jeff Taylor is an individual and is listed as the Applicant on the
13 Project application.

14 16. The true names and capacities, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents named

15 as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who, therefore, sues said Respondents by
16 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when the
17 same has been ascertained.

18 17. The true names and capacities, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in
19 Interest named as ROES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who, therefore, sues said
20 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege their true names
21 and capacities when the same has been ascertained.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 18. This Petition is brought pursuant to sections 526, 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil
24 Procedure; and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9. This court has
25 jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the above provisions and because each of the Respondents and
26 Real Parties named in this litigation are present and operating within the jurisdictional limits of the
27 County of Santa Clara.
28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 19. Venue is proper in this court under sections 393 and 395 of the Code of Civil Procedure
2 because all of the acts and omissions complained of in this litigation took place within this judicial

3 district.

4 STANDING

5 20. Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in the City's full and complete
6 compliance with the City Code, CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in approving the Project and all
7 substantive changes thereto, including the construction and operation of the rooftop generator at issue

8 1n this petition.

9 21. The City has a mandatory and ministerial duty to enforce the Conditions of Approval on
10 LOLA for the benefit of the public.
11 22. Petitioner has the right to enforce the public right and the duties that the City Code,
12 Planning and Zoning law, and CEQA impose on the City.
13 23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, and
14 will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the requested relief.
15 JUSTICIABILITY

16 24. A ruling by this Court will have a practical impact and provide effectual relief in this
17 matter.
18 25. Regardless of the state of Project construction, a ruling in favor of Petitioner "could
19 result in modification of the project to mitigate adverse impacts or even removal of the project
20 altogether." (Woodward Park Homeowners Ass'n y. Garreks, Inc. (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 880, 888.)
21 26. The diesel generator has been approved by the Community Development Department
22 and installed on the roof of the project, but it is not physically impossible to remove. The same or
23 similar apparatus that was used to install the generator can be used to remove it from the roof.
24 27. The City Council approved battery backup system was not installed in the basement of
25 the Project, but it remains feasible to install the approved battery backup system. Petitioner is informed

26 and believes, and based thereon alleges that it would cost between $200,000.00 and $300,000.00 to
27

28

6
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

install a battery backup system in the basement in compliance with the City Council approved
2 development plans.

3 28. Lastly, as recognized by the 2016 Air Quality and Noise studies for the Project, air

4 quality and noise impacts stem from the operation of the diesel generator, not its construction. A Court
5 order directing the City to study and mitigate the Project's operational impacts would provide effectual
6 relief.

7 EXHAUSTION

8 29. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that, due to the improper,
9 underground nature of the Community Development Department's signoff on the revisions to the
10| development plans removing the City Council approved battery backup system and adding the rooftop
11 | diesel generator without complying with the public review process required by the conditions of
12 approval, there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise objections either
13 orally or in writing. Nor did the City give any notice to the public or affected adjacent landowners,
14 including Petitioner, that it would be considering substantive project changes. Under such
15 circumstances the exhaustion doctrine does not apply. (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. State
16 Water Resources Control Bd. (1997) 63 Cal.App.4th 227, 239-241.)

17 30. Petitioner has informed the City in writing of Real Parties' violations of the Conditions
18 of Approval, the City's ministerial duty to enforce the Conditions of Approval, and the City's duty to
19 comply with the City Code, Planning and Zoning law, and CEQA.

20 31. The grounds for noncompliance with CEQA alleged in this Petition are consistent with
21 the written notice provided to the City by Petitioner.

22 32. To the extent provided by the City, Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies.

23 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

24 33. On May 19, 2016 the Planning and Transportation Commission considered and
25 recommended that the City Council approve the Project, including design review, subdivision and Use
26 Permit 2016-UP-02. The Commission also recommended that the City Council find the Project exempt
27 from CEQA as infill development that would not have any significant environmental effects related to
28
7
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 traffic, noise, air or water quality, and where the site is adequately served by all required utilities and
2 public services, pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 14, division 6, chapter 3 (CEQA

3 Guidelines) section 15332.

34. To support the exemption finding, the City and/or Real Parties hired consultants to study

5 the Project's potential effects on traffic, noise, and air quality. These studies were based on the Project
6 proposed to the City in early 2016 and include an Air Quality & Greenhouse Gas Emissions
7 Assessment prepared by Illingworth & Rodkin, Inc. dated March 18, 2016 (Air Quality Study) and a
8 Noise Study prepared by Wilson Ihrig, dated March 2, 2016 (Noise Study). Both studies concluded that
9 the Project would have potentially significant environmental effects and proposed mitigation measures
10 to reduce the air quality and noise impacts to less than significant levels.

11 35. The Air Quality Study concluded that Project operations would not have significant air
12 quality impacts because the Project would not include "[s]tationary sources of air pollution (e.g., back-
13 up generators)." The Air Quality Study went on to conclude that "[o]peration of the project is not
14 expected to cause any localized emissions that could expose sensitive receptors to unhealthy air
15 pollution levels. No stationary sources of TACs, such as generators, are proposed as part of the
16 project." The Air Quality Study also acknowledged that Petitioner's tenants at 845 Jordan Avenue are
17 sensitive receptors and that the Project would add new sensitive receptors to the area. The Air Quality
18 Study only proposed air quality mitigation for Project residents.

19 36. The Noise Study did not consider a rooftop diesel generator as a potential source of
20 Project operational noise and concluded that "current plans indicate that mechanical equipment will be
21 located in a room at the Garage Level, which will contain most of the noise...." The Noise Study also
22 recommended that "[d]uring detailed design of the project, noise mitigation measures will be employed

23 as necessary to ensure compliance with" the City's noise ordinance.

24 37. Implementation of the mitigation measures proposed in the Air Quality and Noise
25 Studies was required in conditions 28 and 29 respectively.

26 38. Development plans dated April 22, 2016 depicted the Project as having: mechanical
27 equipment room in the basement and approximately 2,010 square feet of roof area that would be

28 "prewired" for solar photovoltaic panels.
8
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

39. The plans do not include an area of refuge for building occupants to shelter in place
2 during an emergency. Petitioner is informed and believes that an area of refuge is two layers of sheet

3 rock from the ground up on each floor providing an area of fire safety for occupants to wait for a

4 rescue.

40. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that the lack of a refuge

6 area in the Project required Real Parties to provide backup power to the elevator so that it would

7 continue to operate in an emergency without external power for up to two hours. The City also
8 requested that backup power be provided to the car lift system.

41. Through a letter to the City Council dated August 15, 2016, Real Parties proposed to
10 provide backup power through batteries and included information about battery systems from a battery
11 manufacturer.

12 42. Development plans dated August 12, 2016 depict the Project as having backup batteries
13 in the basement in addition to the mechanical equipment room.
14 43. Neither the April 22, 2016 plans nor the August 12, 2016 plans suggest that a generator
15 of any type would be included at any location on the Project site.

16 44. On September 13, 2016 the City County adopted the recommendations of the Planning
17 and Transportation Commission and approved the Project, subject to the Conditions of Approval, and
18 found it exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15332.

19 45. The adopted Conditions of Approval, in addition to requiring implementation of the
20| recommended mitigation measures for noise and air quality impacts, include two conditions that are
21 particularly relevant to the issues here. First, condition 1 states that "[t]he project approval is based on
22 the plans received on August 12, 2016, except as modified by these conditions." Second, condition 9
23 states that "[t]he Planning and Transportation Commission may approve minor changes to the
24 development plans. Substantive project changes require a formal amendment of the application with
25 review by the Planning and Transportation Commission and City Council."

26 46. On or about August 22, 2017, the City Council adopted the Planning and Transportation
27 Commission's recommendation to approve a height waiver for the Project's elevator tower.
28

9
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

47. On or about January 9, 2018, the Building Department (a subdivision of the Community
2 Development Department) issued Building Permit No. 2016-667756.

3 48. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that, throughout the
4 I construction of the Project, the Community Development Department has signed-off on multiple

5 revisions to the development plans, but, with the exception of the height waiver, the public, the
6 Planning and Transportation Commission, and the City Council have not reviewed any of those
7 changes, including the removal of the battery backup system and the addition of the rooftop diesel

g generator.

9 49. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that Real Parties have not
10 formally amended the Project application for public review by the Planning and Transportation
11 Commission and City County to substantively change the Project by adding the rooftop diesel
12 generator.

13 50. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that the Community
14 Development Department allowed Real Parties to revise the development plans adding the rooftop
15 diesel generator and removing the battery backup system without requiring review by the Planning and
16 Transportation Commission or formal amendment of the application with review by the Planning and
17 Transportation Commission and City Council.

18 51. Petitioner first became aware that the Community Development Department had
19 allowed Real Parties to revise the development plans and construct the rooftop generator, without
20 notice to the public or elected decision makers, through correspondence with Jon Biggs, the

21 Community Development Director for the City of Los Altos, on or about June 12, 2019.

22 52. After additional investigation, including a September 13, 2019, Public Records Act
23 request and the City's October 1, 2019 response, Petitioner discovered that the revisions to the
24 development plans adding the diesel generator and foregoing the City Council approved basement
25 battery backup system did not comply with the public review process set forth in the conditions of
26 approval, and that the prior approvals specifically determined that the Project would not have
27 significant air quality and noise impacts because no generator was included in, or planned for the
28 Project.
10
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

53. The project being constructed is not the Project that the City Council approved on
September 13, 2016. Instead of the clean, quiet power provided by the approved battery backup system
in the basement, the Project will operate with a diesel generator on the roof. The City's analysis of the

4 Project's air quality and noise impacts acknowledge that the operation of a generator can cause air
5 quality and noise impacts, which requires CEQA analysis and mitigation.

6 54. Additionally, by allowing Real Parties to revise the development plans without
7 complying with the public review process required by the conditions of approval, the City has
prevented the public and elected decisionmakers from considering and commenting on this substantive
9 project change.

10 55. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that removing the rooftop
11 generator and installing backup batteries in conformance with the development plans approved by the
12 City Council are both feasible. First, the same or similar apparatus that was used to place the generator
13 on the roof the Project can be used to remove it. Second, no irreversible changes to the Project
14 basement have occurred which would make installation of the City Council approved battery system
15 physically impossible.

16 56. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that the cost of installing
17| backup batteries in the basement of the Project would be between $200,000.00 and $300,000.00.

18 57. By a letter dated November 7, 2019 (attached hereto as Exhibit A) Petitioner appealed
19 the City's improper, underground approval of the rooftop diesel generator and the City's failure to
20 enforce the Conditions of Approval to the City Council pursuant to Los Altos Municipal Code section
21 1.12.010 to ensure that the City Council has the opportunity to consider these issues.

22 58. Petitioner's November 7, 2019 letter informed the City of the basis for Petitioner's
23 appeal and provided the City with the opportunity to redress the harms created by the substantive
24| project changes and the City's failure to enforce the Conditions of Approval.

25 59. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this action,
26 including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing
27 notice to the City that this action would be filed, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
28
11
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

60. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Amended Petition on the California Attorney
2 General as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

61. Petitioner, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the

4 relief requested herein is not granted and the substantive project changes embodied in the rooftop diesel
generator are permitted without the necessary and required planning, environmental review, and
6 mitigation as set forth in the Conditions of Approval and required by law.

62. Petitioner hereby and by a separate election notified the City that Petitioner elects to
8 prepare the record of proceedings relevant to the substantive project changes to the Project and the
9 resulting unstudied significant environmental impacts in compliance with Public Resources Code
10 section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 and Request for Declaratory Relief
13 under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1060: Violation of Mandatory and Ministerial Duty to
14 Enforce the Conditions of Approval)
15 63. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth
16 herein.
17 64. Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 grants this court the authority to issue a writ to the
18 City compelling performance of a mandatory and ministerial duty.
19 65. Los Altos Municipal Code section 14.80.010 requires the City, when approving a
20 conditional use, to consider the "general public interest and the interests of persons residing or working
21 in the vicinity of the use" in setting the conditions of that use. The Conditions of Approval, including
22 those at issue in this Petition, were placed on the Project for the public benefit, including the benefit of
23 those that reside and work in the vicinity of the Project, which includes Petitioner, and its tenants and
24| customers.

25 66. The Conditions of Approval at issue here are unambiguous.
26 a. Condition 1 ties project approval to the specific development plans provided to
27 the City on August 12, 2016 "except as modified by these conditions."
28
12
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

b. Condition 9 allows minor changes to the development plans to be approved by
the Planning and Transportation Commission, but requires that the project
application be formally amended with review by the Planning and Transportation
Commission and City Council for any substantive project changes.

C. Condition 28 requires Real Parties to "implement and incorporate the air quality

6 mitigation into the plans as required by staff in accordance with the" Air Quality

7 Study.

8 d. Condition 29 requires Real Parties to "implement and incorporate the noise
mitigation into the plans as required by staff in accordance with the" Noise

10 Study.

11 67. The City "has no discretion but rather a ministerial duty to enforce the condition[s]."
12 (Terminal Plaza Corp. V. City and County of San Francisco (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 814, 830.)

13 68. The City has not enforced conditions and 9 as the Community Development
14 Department has approved substantive project changes, including removing the City Council approved
15 battery backup system and adding the rooftop diesel generator, without following the public review
16 process required for the review of such changes in the Conditions of Approval.

17 69. The City has not enforced conditions 28 and 29 as the Air Quality and Noise Studies
18 acknowledged that a generator would have air quality and noise impacts. and, in approving the rooftop
19 diesel generator without required review, the City has allowed those impacts to go unmitigated.

20 70. The City's failure to enforce the Conditions of Approval constitute a violation of its
21 mandatory and ministerial duty to do so.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violations of CEQA and Request for Declaratory Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
24 1060: Failure to Accurately Describe the Project, Analyze Admitted Significant Adverse Impacts,
25 and Adopt Feasible Mitigation Measures)

26 71. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth
27 herein.

28 a. The addition of the rooftop generator shifts the Project description, making it inaccurate.
13
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 72. A "project" is "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the
2 environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment.3 (Pub.
3 Resources Code, ยง 21065.) A "project" includes "the whole of an action." (Guidelines, ยง 15378, subd.
4 (a).)

5 73. Without an accurate description of the Project, the public and decision-makers cannot
6 "balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental costs...." (County of Inyo V. City of Los
7 Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192.)

8 74. The Project described in the application and development plans that was approved by
9 the City Council included backup power through a battery system in the basement of the Project and
10 did not include a generator on the roof or anywhere on the site.

11 75. Based on the August 12, 2016 description of the Project, the City Council concluded that
12 the Project was categorically exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines section 15332.

13 76. The Noise and Air Quality Studies both concluded that the Project would not have
14 significant operational impacts, in part, because the Project would not include a generator. The Air
15 Quality Study specifically identified a generator as a source of air pollution and TACs which could
16 impact sensitive receptors adjacent to and within the Project, and concluded that the absence of a
17| generator meant the Project would not have operational air quality impacts.

18 77. Adding the rooftop generator substantively changes the Project and adds new, unstudied,
19 and unmitigated, operational air quality and noise impacts; and negates the conclusions in the Air
20 Quality and Noise Studies, as well as the City Council's determination that the Project is exempt from
21 CEQA.

22 78. The City's failure to analyze the substantive change in the scope of the Project's
23 operational impacts constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion.

24 b. The City failed to adequately analyze the impacts of the rooftop generator.

25 79. The City must compare the Project, including the substantive project changes made by
26 LOLA, "with what will happen if the site is left alone." (Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. V.

27 City of Fresno (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 707.)

28
14
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

80. The Community Development Department's improper, underground approval of the
2 rooftop generator, without the required formal application amendment with review by the Planning and

3 Transportation Commission and City Council, violated CEQA's mandate that the City evaluate the

4 rooftop diesel generator's admitted environmental impacts.

5 81. No such evaluation took place with respect to the admitted significant environmental

6 effects of the rooftop generator. This failure constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

7 C. The City failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures for the rooftop generator.

8 82. CEQA requires the City to adopt all feasible mitigation measures that can substantially
9 lessen the Project's significant impacts, and the City must ensure that these measures are "fully
10 enforceable" through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding instruments. (Pub.
11 Resources Code, ยง 21002; Guidelines ยงยง 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15126.4, subd. (a)(2); City of Marina v.
12 Bd. of Trustees of Cal. State Univ. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 359, 368-369.)

13 83. The requirement of enforceability ensures "that feasible mitigation measures will
14 actually be implemented as conditions of development, and not merely adopted and then neglected or
15 disregarded." (Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83
16 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261, italics omitted.)

17 84. The City's failure to consider or adopt feasible, enforceable mitigation for the admitted
18 significant operational impacts of the rooftop generator constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and
19 violates CEQA.

20 d. The City's underground approval violated CEQA's information disclosure provisions.

21 85. In 2016, the City Council, at a public meeting, approved the Project with battery backup
22 power for the elevator and car lift system in the basement. Years later, and without notice to the public
23 or an opportunity to consider and comment on the substantive change, the Community Development
24 Department effectively reversed the City Council's decision, and permitted Real Parties to forego the
25 basement battery backup system and instead install a diesel generator on the roof of the Project.

26 86. By publicly approving a Project with clean, quiet battery backup power, and then
27 allowing the Project to be built with a diesel generator on the roof instead, without notice to the public
28 | or consideration by elected officials, the City has violated CEQA's informational disclosure provisions.
15
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

T (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 515.) The City's failure to comply with CEQA
2  "subverts the purposes of CEQA [because] it omits material necessary to informed decisionmaking and
3 informed public participation." (Ibid.) The decision makers and the public were not informed that the

4 Project would be substantively changed from the prior public approval.

5 87. The City's errors constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

6 e. The City cannot mitigate its way into another exemption.

7 88. "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be
8 categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124.)

9 89. The City cannot, as it did in 2016, rely on mitigation measures to find the substantively
10 changed Project exempt from CEQA. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin
11 (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1107.)

12 90. The City must study the adverse environmental effects of the substantively changed
13 Project, first through an initial study before determining whether to proceed with an Environmental
14 Impact Report or other CEQA review document. Anything less would be a failure to "afford the fullest
15 possible protection to the environment..." (See Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of
16 San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1184.)

17 f. The generator a itself qualifies as a "project" for the purposes of CEQA.

18 91. The rooftop diesel generator is itself "an activity which may cause direct physical
19 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment....M
20 (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21065; see also Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com.
21 (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 382 ["Whether an activity is a project is an issue of law..."].)

22 92. The City, by adopting the conclusions of the Air Quality Study, has admitted that
23|| generators, including the rooftop diesel generator at issue here, are sources of air pollution and TACs.

24 93. The operation of the rooftop diesel generator is an activity which "involves the issuance
25 to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public
26 agencies." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21065, subd. (c).)

27 94. The Community Development Department approved the rooftop diesel generator.

28
16
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

95. Whether analyzed as a component of the Project or on its own, the rooftop generator
2 requires CEQA review, mitigation, and public disclosure of any decision approving the generator and
3 the environmental consequences of that decision. The City's failure to comply with the requirements of

4 CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

5 PRAYER FOR RELEIF

6 WHEREFORE, Petitionรฉr prays for judgment as follows:

1. That the court issue alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding the City
8 to:

9 a. Set aside and vacate the Community Development Department's improper, underground

10 signoff of the revisions to the development plans removing the battery backup system
11 and adding the rooftop generator;
12 b. Remove the rooftop generator and related infrastructure pending compliance with the
13 Conditions of Approval and CEQA;
14 C. Enforce the Conditions of Approval on Real Parties, and comply with CEQA, in any
15 future proposed change to the Project; including any proposal to add a rooftop generator;
16 2. For a judicial determination and declaration that the Community Development
17 Department's improper, underground approval of the revisions to the development plans removing the
18 City Council approved battery backup system and adding the rooftop diesel generator is void, and
19 without force and effect, and that Respondents must comply with the law and enforce the Conditions of

20 Approval;

21 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary or permanent
22 injunction or other order enjoining Respondents and Real Parties from all work on the Project related to
23 the installation and operation of the rooftop diesel generator, pending compliance with the Conditions
24 of Approval and CEQA;
25 4. For Petitioner's costs of suit;

26 5. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, including, but not limited to, fees authorized
27 under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and 1032 and under Government Code section 800; and

28 6. For such other and further relief as the Court finds just and proper.
