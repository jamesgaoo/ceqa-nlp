INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges Respondents City of Santee ("City") and the City Council

3 of the City of Santee's adoption of the Sustainable Santee Plan and certification of the Program
4 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Sustainable Santee Plan.

5 2. The Sustainable Santee Plan is a Climate Action Plan ("CAP") that is intended as
6 a framework to reduce the City's greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions. The CAP's goals and
7 policies reflect a commendable effort to address GHG emissions implicated in anthropogenic
8 climate change, although they are significantly less aggressive than what is warranted in light of
9 the growing climate crisis.

10 3. At the heart of the CAP, however, there is a glaring loophole that facilitates new
11 automobile-centric sprawl development antithetical to the CAP's stated goals and policies.
12 Specifically, the CAP smooths the way for the Fanita Ranch project, which has been proposed
13 for a 2,635-acre site on the City's northern edge, but which häs not yet been approved or
14 reviewed in an EIR, and which is inconsistent with the City's General Plan.

15 4. The CAP allows the Fanita Ranch project to rely solely on the CAP's Program
16 EIR for its project-level climate impact analysis and to avoid further consideration of mitigation
17 measures or alternatives that might eliminate or reduce these impacts. Thanks to this loophole in
18 the CAP, the Fanita Ranch project has been a given a pre-approval free pass on its GHG

19 emissions, and the CAP has missed a prime opportunity to address the single project that will be
20 responsible for most of the City's new emissions.

21 5. In approving the CAP and certifying the EIR with this flaw, Respondents violated
22 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections 21000 et
23 seq., and rendered the CAP inconsistent with the City's General Plan. The CAP EIR does not
24 adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the entirely foreseeable GHG emissions associated
25 with the Fanita Ranch project, despite its stated intent of avoiding future project-level analyses.
26 The CAP thus commits the City to find that the Fanita Ranch project's emissions are not
27 significant if it is consistent with the CAP, even though Fanita Ranch is not approved and the

28
-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- City has performed no environmental analysis of its specific environmental impacts. It also
2 precludes opportunities to reduce its GHG emissions by project-level mitigation measures that
3° are fine-tuned to the circumstances of the actual project.

4 6. Petitioners PRESERVE WILD SANTEE, CLIMATE ACTION CAMPAIGN, and
5 CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY petition this Court for a writ of mandate under
6 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 directing Respondents to vacate and set aside
7 their certification of the EIR and to preclude use of the CAP to avoid environmental review of
8 the Fanita Ranch project.
9 7. Respondents' approval of the CAP and certification of the EIR constitute a
10 prejudicial abuse of discretion.

11

12 8. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
13 decision to approve the CAP under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or
14 alternatively, section 1085) and Public Resources Code section 21168.5 (or alternatively, section
15 21168) and section 21168.9.

16 9.

17 Venue for this action properly lies in the San Diego County Superior Court
because Respondents are located in the County, and Respondents' actions and omissions
18 described herein occurred in the County. Many of the CAP's environmental impacts, including
19 those associated with facilitation of the Fanita Ranch project, would occur in San Diego County,
20 and the CAP affects the interests of San Diego County residents, including members of
21 Petitioners who reside in San Diego County.

22 10. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
23 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on
24 Respondents on February 7, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached
25 hereto as Exhibit A.

26 11. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
27 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioners' request to prepare the record of
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

t

- administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the Petitioners' Election to Prepare
2 Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

3 12. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
4 action and have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law,

5 including, but not limited to, timely submitting extensive comments objecting to the CAP in its
6 approved form and identifying to Respondents the deficiencies in Respondents' environmental
7 review.

13. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
9 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

10 THE PARTIES

11 14. Petitioner PRESERVE WILD SANTEE ("PWS") Santee is a volunteer
12 community environmental organization that has worked to protect and enhance the quality of
13 life and preserve natural resources in the City of Santee and adjoining areas since 1994. Preserve
14 Wild Santee's members offer input into local land use decisions in an effort to produce better
15 development projects with fewer environmental and fire safety impacts. PWS participated
16 extensively in the development and public review of the City's CAP by urging the City to adopt
17 more aggressive climate goals and emissions reductions, and to avoid facilitating new sprawl
18 development antithetical to these climate goals and emissions reductions.
19 15. Petitioner CLIMATE ACTION CAMPAIGN ("CAC") is a grassroots organization
20 committed to stopping climate change by helping local governments in the San Diego region to
21 pass and carry out successful climate action plans with commitments of 100% clean energy
22 sources by 2035. CAC has worked extensively with local jurisdictions in the San Diego area to
23 draft CAPs and develop policies to reduce GHG emissions. CAC participated in the
24 development and public review of the City's CAP by seeking more aggressive GHG reduction
25 goals and policies, and by objecting to the inclusion of the unapproved Fanita Ranch project in
26 the CAP's "land use buffer."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 16. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a non-
2 profit conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats

3 through science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 70,000 members
4 worldwide, including residents of the City of Santee and surrounding communities. The Center
5 has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air and water
6 quality, and the overall quality of life for people in and around the City. It has participated in the

7 development and public review of this CAP and many others throughout the state. Members of
8 the Center objected to the approval of the CAP and its inclusion of the unapproved Fanita Ranch
9 project in the CAP's "land use buffer."
10 17. Members of PWS, CAC, and the Center have environmental, educational,
11 recreational, scientific, and aesthetic interests in the area covered by the CAP and this area's
12 plants and wildlife. Members of PWS, CAC, and the Center also have an interest in ensuring
13 that the CAP is effective in meeting its goals and advancing California's broader climate goals.
14 These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the approved CAP, which violates
15 provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause irreversible harm to the
16 natural environment and its recreational, scientific, and aesthetic assets. The Petitioners and their
17 members have a direct and beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA
18 and the City's General Plan. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
19 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
20 harms alleged herein.

21 18. Respondent CITY OF SANTEE is a local governmental agency and political
22 subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to regulate and administer land
23 use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of all
24 applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the California
25 Planning and Zoning Law, and the Subdivision Map Act. The City of Santee is the CEQA lead
26 agency for the EIR prepared for the CAP project.

3 20. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

4 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore

5 sue said respondents under fictitious names. Does 1 through 20, inclusive, are agents of
6 Respondents, other local, state, or federal governmental entities that are responsible in some
7 manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or entities presently unknown
8 to the Center who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that is the subject of this
9 action. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when the
10 same have been ascertained.

11 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

12 The Sustainable Santee Plan and Climate Action Plan

13 21. The CAP/Sustainable Santee Plan is subtitled "The City's Roadmap to
14 Greenhouse Gas Reductions." As this subtitle suggests, the CAP's purpose is reduce the City's
15 GHG emissions. The CAP anticipates other collateral environmental, social, and economic
16 benefits, but in recognition of the growing climate crisis and the urgent need to act at the local,
17 regional, and state levels, it is intended primarily as a plan for reducing GHG emissions and
18 preparing for climate related impacts.

19 22. The CAP describes the City's current GHG inventory, and forecasts future
20 emissions through 2035. It sets emissions reduction targets for 2030 (40 percent below 2005

21 levels) and 2035 (49 percent below 2005 levels) that are intended to "put the City on a path
22 consistent with the State's long-term goal to achieve Statewide carbon neutrality (zero net
23  emissions)" as soon as possible and no later than 2045.
24 23. The CAP provides a series of GHG reduction measures. Some of these measures
25 apply to existing residential and commercial units, and are intended to reduce energy demand.
26 Other measures, such as tree planting, would apply throughout the City. Several measures would
27 expressly apply to new residential development, including requirements to exceed statewide

28 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

building standards for energy efficiency, install electric vehicle chargers, and install
2 photovoltaic solar systems, where feasible. The CAP also anticipates the City's adoption of a
3 Community Choice Aggregation Program, which the Council voted to move forward by

4 separate action on October 8, 2019, although the City has to date failed to accept invitations to

5 join either of the two regional Community Choice Aggregation programs starting operations in

6 2021.

7 24. Appendix A to the CAP details the CAP's GHG inventory, emissions forecasting,
8 and target-setting provisions. Appendix A explains that the City based its forecasts of future

9 emissions (as well as the anticipated emissions reductions under the CAP) on two scenarios: a
10 Business as Usual ("BAU") scenario, which considers anticipated growth but assumes that the
11 policies and energy efficiency standards of 2013 will remain in place and constant through 2035
12 without implementation of new emissions reduction strategies, and an Adjusted BAU scenario
13 that assumes the future implementation of such strategies.

14 25. Growth under both scenarios includes anticipated population growth and land use
15 forecasts according to the City's current General Plan. In addition, both scenarios assume a
16 2,000-unit "land use buffer" that includes the "residential dwelling unit applications that were at

17 different stages of approval at the time the BAU scenarios were being developed ... ." The CAP
18 states that it included the land use buffer projects in the growth scenarios "to ensure that the
19 growth assumptions within the Sustainable Santee Action Plan were accurately depicting growth
20 through the 2035 horizon year."

21 26. Appendix A breaks down the land use buffer into three categories. The first

22 consists of four "Approved/Under Construction" residential projects accounting for 291 units.
23 The second consists of four "Approved-Not Built" projects accounting for 97 units. In a class of
24 its own, described as "Pending Entitlement," is the Fanita Ranch Specific Plan, accounting for
25 1,612 units. These 1,612 units represent future Fanita Ranch development above and beyond
26 what is permitted under the City's current General Plan-in other words, development that is
27 not permitted under the existing General Plan.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r

27. In 2018, the City issued a notice that it intends to prepare an EIR for the Fanita

2 Ranch development. The notice describes a project of 2,949 residential units (or 3,008 units if

3 the project does not include a school) on 2,635 acres on the City's northern edge, which would
4 require the grading of approximately 27 million cubic yards of soil. The notice provides a land

5 use plan for the project, showing the location and density of the proposed Fanita Ranch
6 "villages." The proposed project is considerably larger than the most recent previous iteration of

7 Fanita Ranch, which would have included about 1,380 units. The notice acknowledges that a
8 General Plan amendment and re-zoning is required for the project. The project described in the

9 2018 notice is inconsistent with the current General Plan, the existing land use plan, and existing
10 zoning classifications because it exceeds the General Plan's land use allocation for the area by
11 about 1,600 unitsthe margin that is included in the CAP's land use buffer. To date, no EIR has
12 been circulated for the new Fanita Ranch project.

13 28. Thus, over 80 percent of the CAP's land use buffer consists not of an accurate
14 depiction of growth, but of a hypothetical development that has not been built, approved, or
15 subject to public environmental review, and that is not authorized under the current General
16 Plan.

17 29. Appendix D to the CAP provides a "Consistency Checklist" to evaluate whether
18 new development is consistent with the CAP. Projects that are consistent with the existing land
19 use plan and zoning designations would be deemed consistent with the CAP if they meet the
20 | criteria on a short checklist. In addition, Projects that are included in the CAP's Appendix A

21 land use buffer, but that are inconsistent with existing land use plan and zoning designations,
22 would be deemed consistent with the CAP if they satisfy the Consistency Checklist criteria.

23 30. The Consistency Checklist requires no new environmental analysis or inquiry into
24 the specific circumstances or magnitude of a new development's GHG emissions. It merely asks
25 whether the new development (1) meets or exceeds California Green Building Standards Tier 2
26 voluntary measures; (2) includes sidewalks and bicycle trails; (3) includes electric vehicle
27 chargers; and (4) includes installation of residential photovoltaic solar systems where feasible. If

28 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a project meets the criteria of the checklist, it would be deemed consistent with the CAP. In

2 addition, because the City contends that the CAP is a qualified GHG emissions reduction
3 program pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15183.5, a project deemed consistent with the

4 CAP "will be found to have a less than significant contribution to cumulative GHG" and will not
5 be required to provide any project-specific analysis of GHG emissions.

6 31. On Petitioners' information and belief, Fanita Ranch is the only project included

7 in the CAP's land use buffer that is inconsistent with existing land use plan and zoning

8 designations. It is thus the only known project that is inconsistent with the current General Plan
9 and zoning but that is afforded the streamlined environmental review process described in the
10 CAP's Consistency Checklist. According to the CAP, any future development project other than

11 Fanita Ranch that is inconsistent with existing land use plan and zoning designation would need
12| to complete project-level environmental analysis for its climate impacts.
13 The CAP Program EIR

14 32. The City prepared the EIR to evaluate the environmental effects of the Sustainable
15. Santee Plan/CAP. The EIR is a program EIR, meaning that it is intended to serve as the upper-
16 level environmental review for a series of related actions. Future project-level EIRs may "tier"
17 off the program EIR by relying the program EIR's programmatic analysis of GHG emissions.

18 33. The EIR is expressly intended to provide streamlined environmental review for

19 new development. Future discretionary actions would be evaluated based on the analysis in the
20 program EIR. If the impacts of these future activities are within the scope of the program EIR's

21 analysis, "no further CEQA documentation would be required."

22 34. The EIR evaluates a range of potential impacts associated with the CAP. It
23 l concludes that the CAP would result in less than significant impacts on air quality, GHG
24 emissions, biological resources, land use and planning, and wildfire risk. The EIR concludes that
25 the CAP may have a significant impact on aesthetics and public safety, but that these impacts
26 would be less than significant with the inclusion of two mitigation measures. Thus, the EIR
27 concludes that the approved CAP will have no significant, unavoidable environmental impacts.

28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

35. The EIR assumes that Fanita Ranch will be built, and evaluates the CAP's
2 environmental consequences based on this assumption.

3 36. The City circulated the Draft Program EIR for public review and comment
4 between March 15, 2019 and April 29, 2019. It received public comments on the CAP and EIR,
5 including multiple written comments submitted by Petitioners. Commenters pointed out the
6 deficiencies in the CAP and EIR, and objected to the inclusion of the unapproved Fanita Ranch

7 project in the CAP's land use buffer.

8 37. In December 2019, the City released the Final Program EIR, which included some

9 changes to the text of the Draft EIR, as well as Respondents' responses to public comments on
10 the Draft EIR. The defects identified in the Draft EIR identified by commenters persisted in the

11 Final EIR.

12 Respondents' Approval of the CAP and Certification of the EIR

13 38. At the conclusion of the Council's January 8, 2020 hearing, the Council approved
14 the CAP, certified the Final EIR, and adopted findings in support of the project approval and

15 EIR certification.

16 39. On January 9, 2020, the City filed a Notice of Determination for the CAP, which
17 stated that the City had approved the CAP/Sustainable Santee Plan project, certified the EIR,
18 and adopted findings for the project.

19 40. a As a result of Respondents' actions in approving the CAP, certifying the EIR for
20 the Project, and adopting findings, Petitioners and their members will suffer significant and
21 irreparable harm as described herein. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at
22 law for this irreparable harm. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require
23 Respondents to set aside certification of the EIR, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in .
24 violation of state law.

25 41. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
26 required by law in the following ways:

27 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

28
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
2 42. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
3 above.

4 43. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that long-term protection of the

5 environment be the guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a
6 discretionary action with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an

7 EIR for the project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited
8 to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. The
9 EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can
10| intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed
11 project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on
12 substantial evidence in the record.

13 44. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and
14 enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant
15 environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less
16 than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible
17 alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
18 significant environmental impacts.

19 45. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of

20 the agency's findings and conclusions, including those contained in the EIR, and that the agency
21 explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

22 46. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
23 manner required by law because the CAP EIR fails to meet CEQA's requirements for the
24 disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of the foreseeable significant
25 environmental impacts of the CAP.

26

27

28
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

47. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the foreseeable GHG
2 emissions of the CAP, including those associated with the unapproved Fanita Ranch project,
3 even though that project is included in the CAP's "land use buffer" and inventory forecast.
4 48. The EIR's project description is legally inadequate because the EIR fails to
5 include an accurate and full description of the whole of the CAP project, including the
6 unapproved Fanita Ranch project, even though that project is included in the CAP's "land use
7 buffer" and inventory forecast and its impacts are reasonably foreseeable and subject to

8 disclosure at this time.

49. The EIR evaluates the CAP's environmental impacts using an improper baseline.
10 The EIR unlawfully includes the unapproved Fanita Ranch project as part of the baseline used to
11 evaluate the CAP's environmental impacts.

12 50. The EIR improperly predetermines the disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of the
13| Fanita Ranch project's GHG emissions impacts, despite the EIR's failure to adequately disclose,
14 analyze, and mitigate those impacts.

15 51. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the CAP's
16 inconsistency with the City's General Plan.

17 52. The EIR evaluates an inadequate and overly narrow range of alternatives to the
18 approved CAP. It a considers only a "no project" alternative and an "Accelerated Reduction
19 Program Alternative." It fails to consider alternatives that would exclude unapproved projects
20 that are inconsistent with the existing General Plan and zoning, such as Fanita Ranch, from the
21 scope of the CAP.

22 53. The responses to public comments in the Final EIR fail to meet CEQA's
23 requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide specific
24| rationale for rejecting suggested changes to the CAP, EIR, mitigation measures, or alternatives.
25 CEQA requires that the lead agency evaluate and respond to all environmental comments on the
26| Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period. The responses must describe the
27 disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain reasons for rejecting suggestions

28 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's responses to
2 comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law.

3 54. The City failed to recirculate the EIR despite new significant new information

4 added to the EIR after the close of the public comment period on the Draft EIR.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Findings Not Supported By Substantial Evidence

7 (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5)

8 55. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
9 above.

10 56. Respondents' findings concluding that the CAP will result in no significant

11 environmental effects are not supported by substantial evidence and do not provide adequate
12 reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by law.
13 57. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner
14 required by law, and their decisions to approve the CAP and certify the EIR were not supported
15 by substantial evidence.

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of California Planning and Zoning Law
18 (Government Code 65300, et seq.)
19 58. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
20 above.

21 59. The California Planning and Zoning Law provides that the City's General Plan is a
22 fundamental land use planning document and serves as the constitution for future development
23 within the City. All City land use and planning actions, including the CAP, must be consistent

24 with the General Plan.

25 60. The CAP is inconsistent with the General Plan because it incorporates and
26 assumes the development of the Fanita Ranch project, which is inconsistent with the General
27 Plan.

28 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

61. By approving project inconsistent with the City's General Plan, Respondents
2 abused their discretion and violated provisions of the California Planning and Zoning Law.

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Pursuant to the California Environmental

Dear Ms. Ortiz:

Pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, this is to provide written notice
that Preserve Wild Santee, Climate Action Campaign, and the Center for Biological Diversity
("Petitioners") intend to commence a legal action against the City of Santee and the City Council
of the City of Santee ("Respondents") for a writ of mandate challenging Respondents' approval
of the Sustainable Santee Plan and certification of an Environmental Impact Report for the

Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Alleging Environmental Harm
The enclosed Petition for Writ of Mandate in Preserve Wild Santee v. City of Santee, San
Diego County Superior Court Case No. 37-2020-00007331-CU-TT-CTL, is submitted to your office pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code 21167.7.
Petitioners in this case challenge the City of Santee's approval of the City's Climate Action Plan, known as the Sustainable Santee Plan, and certification of a program environmental impact report for the plan. Petitioners allege environmental harms that could affect the public generally and the natural resources of the state. Petitioners are specifically concerned that the Climate Action Plan will be used to avoid the disclosure, analysis, and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from large, unbuilt, and unapproved development project known as Fanita Ranch, thus missing opportunities to avoid or minimize environmental harm and hindering achievement of statewide emissions objectives.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Cl- Boa John Buse
