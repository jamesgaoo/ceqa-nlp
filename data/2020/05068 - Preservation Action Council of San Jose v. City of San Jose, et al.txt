Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 Petitioner alleges:
Introduction
2

3 1. The Preservation Action Council of San José (PAC-SJ) brings this

4 mandamus action in the public interest to enforce the California Environmental

5

6 Quality Act (CEQA), a citizen-enforced statute. PAC-SJ challenges the City of San

7 José's approval of the CityView Plaza Project, which would needlessly demolish

8 significant historic resources in the guise of progress, despite the feasibility of

9 mitigation measures and viable project alternatives to accomplish fundamental project
10 objectives. Of particular concern is the proposed razing of the brutalist 1973 Bank of
11

12 California Building at 170 Park Center Plaza, which the City recognizes as an

13 "exceptional" building designed by "internationally renowned architect César Pelli."

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25 The building can and should be incorporated into any new project on the

26 CityView Plaza site, which is large enough to accommodate significant new

27 construction without sacrificing one of the City's most distinctive buildings of the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 1970s, a pivotal decade in the history of San José. The City's Envision 2040 General Plan

2 emphasizes the advantages of an architecturally diverse downtown composed of an

3 eclectic mix of historic architecture side by side award-winning contemporary urban
4

5 design. Intensification of the City's downtown development need not sacrifice its

6 historic legacy, and CEQA disallows such short-sighted actions by elected officials

7 when significant environmental impacts can be avoided by feasible alternatives. The

8 City's own historic resource analysis concludes that the approved project is not
9

10 consistent with General Plan Policy LU-13.2, which mandates that the top priority of

11 the City is to preserve candidate or designated landmark buildings.

12 PAC-SJ proposed alternatives to allow the project to proceed without demoliton

13 of the Bank of California Building, and to require substantial compensatory mitigation
14

15 to protect other City buildings and fund historic surveys, in light of the loss of other

16 buildings on the Plaza.

17 This Court's peremptory writ is sought to enforce CEQA to set aside the City's

18 certification of the EIR and approvals of the City View Plaza Project. The City should
19 not reconsider the project without revising and recirculating the EIR to comply with
20

21 CEQA and adopting approval findings supported by substantial evidence.

22

23 Jurisdiction

24 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and

25 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The parties are located in and doing business in
26

27 the City of San José in the County of Santa Clara, and the CityView site is located there.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 Parties

2 3. Petitioner Preservation Action Council of San José aka PAC-SJ is a non-

4 profit California corporation formed in 1990. Its purposes include the promotion of
I protection and adaptive reuse of the City's historic resources. Its members enjoy and
appreciate the historic CityView Plaza and the Bank of California Building and
environs and seek to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act to protect these
8

9 historic resources from demolition. PAC-SJ brings this petition on behalf of all others

10 similarly situated and too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as

11 petitioners. Its members objected to the respondents' approval of the CityView Plaza

12 Project and exhausted their administrative remedies.
13
4.
14 Respondents City of San Jose and its City Council (collectively, the City) is

15 the governmental body that approved the project and certified its environmental

16 impact report and is the lead agency responsible for CEQA compliance.

17 5. Real party in interest SJ CityView, LLC (the applicant) is the proponent of
18 the City View Project and is the named project applicant in the Notice of Determination.
19

20 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true

21 names and capacities are currently unknown to the petitioners. If and when true names

22 and capacities are known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.
23 7. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.
24

25 General Allegations
26

27 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that

28 will be lodged with this court as part of the record of proceedings

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

•

1 9. The CityView Plaza project at issue requires a Site Development Permit to

2 allow the demolition of the approximately 960,567 square-foot City View Plaza,

3 containing numerous historic structures including the Bank of California Building,
4
removal of 31 ordinance size trees, and construction of an office development totaling

6 approximately 3.8 million square feet of office and commercial space above a

7 subterranean parking garage on an approximately 8.1 gross-acre site at the corner of

8 Almaden Boulevard and Park Avenue in San José.
9
10.
10 The City prepared Draft Supplemental EIR that was circulated for public

11 comment for 45 days during the COVID 19 pandemic. Among those objecting to the

12 adequacy of the EIR and project approval were PAC-SJ, the California Preservation

13 Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Among the objections to
14

15 the EIR adequacy and project approvals were the City's failure to adequately consider

16 alternatives in sufficient detail to avoid demolition of historic resources including the

17 Bank of California Building, and failure to identify and analyze and impose mitigation

18 measures including compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the
19 Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and
20

21 Reconstructing Historic Buildings, protection of the Bank of California, and

22 compensatory mitigation.

23 11. The Planning Commission recommended certification of the SEIR and First

24 Amendment and recommended project approval with further evaluation of parking.
25

26 The City Council certified the SEIR and approved the project on June 16, 2020.

27 12. The City filed a Notice of Determination in June, 2020. However, due to

28 the pandemic the California Judicial Council issued Emergency Order 9 that tolled

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 CEQA statutes of limitation from April 2020 until August 3, 2020. This action is timely-

2 filed on September 2, 2020, within the 30-day statute of limitations.

3 13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
4

5 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and

6 irreparable harm to San José residents and the City's environment via implementation

7 of the City View Project without compliance with state law. The City has the capacity to

8 correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

9

10 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

11 14. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

12 15. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process
13
before taking actions that may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The 14

15 point of the process is to inform the public and to provide necessary information to

16 allow elected officials and decisionmakers to comply with CEQA's substantive

17 mandate: to adopt feasible project mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a
18 project's significant environmental impacts.
19

20 16. The City abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

21 law in approving the CityView Project with significant environmental impacts, inter

22 alia, as documented by the to-be-lodged record of proceeding; certification of the
23 inadequate Supplemental EIR; overly-narrow project objectives; insufficient analysis of
24

25 significant project impacts, mitigations, and alternatives as a matter of law to a

26 adequately provide information to the decisionmakers and the public; inadequate

27 analysis of project inconsistencies with City plans and policies; failure to conform

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 project approval to General Plan mandates including LU-13.2; with inadequate analysis

2 and mitigation for project impacts;

3 b. Failure to adequately respond to comments on the EIR;
4

5 C. Failure to adopt findings supported by substantial evidence in the whole of

6 the record and contrary to facts and analysis in that record, including but not limited to

7 findings as to significance of project environmental impacts and feasibility of

8 mitigations and project alternatives.
9

10 d. Failure to identify, study, or adopt identified project mitigation measures and

11 alternatives that could reduce or avoid various identified environmental impacts,
12 including but not limited to mitigations set forth in the City's plans, policies, and

13 guidelines and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic
14

15 Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing

16 Historic Buildings to substantially reduce significant impacts.

17 WHEREFORE, the petitioner prays:

18 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the City
19
respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the CityView Project,
20

21 requiring that before further consideration of project approval the City revise and

22 recirculate the project SEIR and identify and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives

23 and make all findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;

24 2. That the Court enjoin the City, real party, and their employees and agents from all
25

26 physical actions furthering the project while the petition is pending and after judgment

27 pending compliance with the writ;

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 3. For petitioner's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to Code of

2 Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
