Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioners allege:
Introduction
2

3 1. The non-profit Sainte Claire Historic Preservation Foundation is

4 devoted to preservation of the 1893 Sainte Claire Club building and its urban environs.

5 The Club building, a contributor to the St. James Park Historic District, is honored with
6

7 listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The 1988 Club is California's second

8 oldest operating men's social club, founded by local businessmen and ranchers.

9 The Foundation alleges that San José violated its Municipal Code and the
10 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a citizen-enforced statute, when
11

12 approving the multi-million-dollar St. James Park Capital Vision and Performing Arts

13 Pavilion Project. Local and state laws dictate that feasible project mitigation measures

14 and alternatives be imposed to revitalize the park without needless significant impacts.

28 The Saint Claire Club

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

The Foundation supports revival and restoration of the park not only to benefit

2 the Sainte Claire Club but the entire St. James Park Historic District and all San José

3 citizens. However, the project proposes a problematic performing arts / music pavilion
4

5 to accommodate up to 300 events a year for up to 5000 attendees. Locating such a large

6 concert venue at the park would cause significant environmental impacts including

7 construction-related and operational noise exceeding codified limits. The city concedes

8 that project alterations to historic fabric and integrity of the historic district would also
9

10 result in the listing in the National Register of Historic Places becoming untenable.

11 CEQA has both procedural and substantive mandates. Public agencies like the

12 city must study all potentially significant project impacts in an environmental impact

13 report (EIR) and then mitigate and avoid discovered impacts when feasible. The park
14 project EIR is inadequate in various respects challenged in this action. In addition, the
15

16 City Council rejected feasible mitigations and the EIR's identified alternate feasible

17 downtown location for the pavilion at Discovery Meadow --- without legal basis.

18 The city's approval of the project's Historic Preservation Permit also violates the
19 Municipal Code's Historic Preservation Ordinance. That ordinance disallows approval
20

21 of a project "detrimental to an historic district or to structure ... of significant a

22 architectural, cultural, historical, aesthetic or engineering interest or value ..."

23 The Foundation thus urgently seeks this Court's judgment and peremptory writ
24 in the public interest, to set aside EIR certification and approvals of the St. James Park
25

26 Capital Vision and Performing Arts Pavilion Project. A revised project must comply

27 with the city's Municipal Code and CEQA's procedural and substantive mandates.

| Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Jurisdiction

2 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5
3

4 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and St. James Park are located

5 in the City of San José in the County of Santa Clara.

6

7 Parties

8 3. Petitioner Sainte Claire Historic Preservation Foundation is a non-profit

9 California corporation formed in 2003. The Foundation's purposes include the
10

11 protection and preservation of the historic Mission Revival style 1893 Sainte Claire

12 Club building located at 65 E St. James Street and the beauty of the St. James Park

13 Historic District that Sainte Claire Club members enjoy and appreciate. The Foundation
14 brings this petition on behalf of others similarly situated that are too numerous to be
15

16 named and brought before this Court. The Foundation objected to the approval of the

17 St. James Park project and exhausted administrative remedies.

18 4. Respondents City of San José and its City Council, and its Department of

19 Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services (collectively, the city), are the
20

21 governmental bodies that prepared and certified the project EIR and approved the

22 project. The city is the lead agency responsible for CEQA compliance. The city named

23 the respondent Department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services in the

24 project Notice of Determination as the sole project applicant.
25
5. Real parties in interest Mortimer and Mimi Levitt Foundation and Levitt
26

27 Pavilion San José are businesses entities whose forms and capacities are unknown to

28 the Foundation, and which may have an interest in the proposed performing arts

13 General Allegations

14 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that

15 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings.
16

17 Environmental Setting
18
9.
19 St. James Park is an 7.5-acre urban park in downtown San José. The park

20 is bisected by North 2nd Street and is bounded by East St. James Street to the north,

21 East St. John Street to the south, North 1st Street to the west, and North 3rd Street to the

22 east. The park primarily consists of landscaping, including lawn areas and mature
23

24 trees. Park features also include paved walkways, seating areas, an 840-square foot

25 fitness parcourse, a dog park, a playground, restrooms, memorials (Naglee Memorial,
26 McKinley Memorial, and Robert F. Kennedy Podium), a wood stage, and a fountain.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

10. The St. James Square City Landmark District (HD84-36) is listed under the

2 theme Social, Arts, and Recreation for the 1846-1870 Early American Period. The park
was designed in 1848 by Chester Lyman and is the only public square in the city's
downtown core. It is surrounded by buildings significant for civic design and uses

6 from the 1860s through the 1930s, including the Sainte Claire Club.

11. A separate National Register of Historic Places District for St. James Square
includes ten contributors: the park and nine buildings. The district is also included in

10 the California Register of Historical Resources.

13 12. The Sainte Claire Club building, completed in 1893, was designed by
14 renowned architect A. Page Brown in the Mission Revival architectural style. Brown
16 designed the San Francisco Ferry Building and introduced Mission Revival architecture 15

17 to Santa Barbara. Many features of this style are evident in his design for the Sainte

18 Claire Club including the tile roof and arched entryways.
19

20 Project Description
21
13. The project proposes to renovate St. James Park both physically and by 22

23 changes in its historic uses. It proposes the demolition and removal of most existing

24 park structures, with the exception of the monuments and heritage trees. Physical

25 changes include adding a performing arts pavilion, cafe and restroom, picnic pavilion
26

27 and Naglee picnic grove, two dog parks, McKinley meadow, plaza , playground,

28 fountain, park office building, security lighting, landscaping, perimeter garden fencing,

6 Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 transportation network modifications and pedestrian improvements including a

2 monument walk, and utility improvements.

3 14. The project proposes continuation of existing park uses and events and
4
"additional programmatic elements" to include hundreds of annual events at a new

6 performing arts pavilion at the northeast corner of the park. The pavilion would be a

7 5,000-spectator outdoor music and performance venue with lighting and sound

8 amplification. It would have a 4,000-square foot stage and a single-story support
9

10 building with an office, dressing rooms, bathrooms, and storage areas, with a large

11 open lawn area for audiences. A permanent canopy is proposed to reach up to a height

12 of 35 feet, with triangular panels that would cover the stage area and extend along the

13 northern perimeter of the audience lawn. The pavilion is designed for almost daily
14

15 (up to 300 annual) events including film festivals, concerts, and dance and theatre
16 performances, with as many as 72 large concerts / events for up to 5,000 attendees.

17 Commercial uses would include a cafe and vendors of food, beverage, and

18 merchandise associated with pavilion events; street performers; and a farmer's market. a
19

20 Administrative Process and Project Approval
21 15. The initial Notice of Preparation of the EIR for the park project was
22

23 published in 2016. Planning for the project proceeded over the next four years in many

24 forums. The city did not publish the project EIR that underlies this action until May 19,

25 2020. The EIR analysed what it determined would be significant unavoidable impacts
26 on aesthetics, cultural resources, noise, and recreation. The EIR concluded that the
27

28 project's significant unavoidable cultural resources impacts could be avoided by

I Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 compliance with the federal Secretary of the Interior Standards for the Treatment of Historic

2 Properties, recommended by the EIR's historic consultant. The Secretary's Standards are

3 widely used nationwide, as acknowledged and encouraged by CEQA.
4
16.
5 While the park project was also conceded to result in significant impacts

6 to biological resources, air quality, hazards and hazardous materials, and operational

7 noise and vibration, the EIR posited that each of those impacts could be mitigated to

8 less-than-significant levels.

9
17.
10 The city accepted public comments on the Draft EIR for 45 days, from May

11 2020 until early July. While the revitalization of the park was universally praised, the

12 size and significant environmental impacts of the proposed pavilion were not. Many

13 public commentors, including the Foundation and the Sainte Claire Club, suggested
14

15 mitigations and feasible project revisions, including compliance with the Secretary's

16 Standards and relocation of the pavilion to a feasible alternate downtown site. As

17 conceded by the city in the EIR's formal responses to comments: "The Draft EIR

18 (Section 3.5.2.1) clearly identifies a significant and unavoidable impact on the historic
19 integrity of the park and the district because it was determined that the proposed
20

21 design was not substantially consistent with the applicable [Secretary's Standards]."

22 18. Following review and approvals by the Planning Commission and the

23 Historic Landmarks Commission, which suggested project mitigations, at the close of a

24 public hearing on October 27, 2020, the City Council approved resolutions certifying
25

26 the EIR; approving the "St. James Park Updated Capital Vision (Master Plan);" made

27 CEQA findings concerning significant project impacts, mitigation measures, and
28 alternatives; and approved a Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 Monitoring and Reporting Program.

2 19. Deputy Planning Director Robert Manford approved the project's Historic

3 Preservation (HP) Permit required by Chapter 13.48 of the Municipal Code on
4

5 October 28, following public hearings on October 21 and 28. The Foundation objected

6 to the HP Permit issuance in violation of mandates of the Historic Preservation

7 Ordinance, both in writing and in zoom hearings before Director Manford. The

8 Foundation then filed a timely administrative appeal to the City Council; the appeal
9 zoom hearing is now scheduled for December 15, 2020. The Foundation raised the legal
10

11 issues regarding the HP Permit before the City Council at its public hearing on October

12 27, 2020. This petition will be amended following the City Council's action on the

13 appeal because the Director's approval of the HP Permit is not final.
14
20. The city filed a CEQA Notice of Determination on October 30, 2020, and it
15

16 was required to be posted for 30 days. The 30th day fell on Sunday, November 29,

17 which by a statute is a court holiday. This action is timely-filed on the next court day.

18 21. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary

19 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and
20

21 irreparable harm to San José residents and the city's environment via implementation

22 of the St. James Park project without compliance with state law. The city has the

23 capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do sO.

24

25 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

26
22.
27 Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

28 23. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 before taking actions that may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The

2 process informs the public and provides necessary information to allow elected officials

3 to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate: adoption of feasible project mitigations
4

5 and alternatives that can reduce a project's significant environmental impacts.

24. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

7 law as described below, in approving the St. James Park project despite significant

8 environmental impacts, inter alia and as documented by the to-be-lodged record of

9

10 proceedings and subject to proof:

11 a. Certification of an inadequate EIR with insufficient analysis of significant

12 project impacts for which a fair argument was presented, including but not limited to

13 impacts relating to parking and sanitation and inadequate analysis of project
14

15 inconsistencies with city plans and policies adopted for environmental protection;

16 b. Failure to adequately respond to comments on the EIR;

17 C. Failure to adopt findings supported by substantial record evidence and

18 contrary to facts and analysis in that record, including but not limited to findings as to

19 significance of project environmental impacts, including operational noise, and the
20

21 feasibility of mitigations and project alternatives, including, in particular, findings

22 insufficient to reject the Discovery Meadow Alternative Pavilion Location that meets

23 fundamental project objectives.

24 d. Failure to identify, study, and /or adopt identified project mitigation
25

26 measures and alternatives that could reduce or avoid various identified environmental
27 impacts, including but not limited to mitigations set forth in the city's plans, policies,

28 and guidelines and in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 Properties to substantially reduce significant impacts.

2

3 Violation of the San José Municipal Code

4 25. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
5
26. Municipal Code section 13.48.240, the city's Historic Preservation
6

7 Ordinance, requires Historic Preservation (HP) Permits for alterations of any property
8 designated as a landmark or located within a city historic district. The city must deny an

9 HP Permit if proposed alterations "will be detrimental to an historic district or to a
10 structure or feature of significant architectural, cultural, historical, aesthetic or
11

12 engineering interest or value."

13 27. The city unlawfully issued an HP Permit for the park project in violation of
14 its Historic Preservation Ordinance. As reflected in the project EIR and conceded in its

15 staff reports, construction and implementation of the park project would damage
16

17 existing historic elements and adversely impact the historic integrity of St. James Park

18 and the St. James Park Historic District.

19 28. The city concedes that the project is not in substantial conformance with

20 the general character and surface treatment (including fenestration, materials, detailing,
21

22 and color) of the St. James Square Historic District Guidelines. The project does not

23 conform with the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation that the city applies to

24 properties affecting valued historic resources. The non-conformance extends to

25 proposed new structures and even the "overall design." The approved HP Permit
26 recites in relevant part that "[t[he project will have a significant and unavoidable
27

28 impact on the National significance of St. James Park under the California

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

1 Environmental Quality Act. The project does not fully comply with the 1989 St. James

2 Square Historic District Guidelines and the Secretary of Interior's Standards (SOI) for the

3 Treatment of Historic Properties Rehabilitation Standards."
4

5 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray:

6 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the city
7

8 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the St. James Park Capital

9 Vision and Performing Arts Pavilion Project and Historic Preservation Permit,
10 including certification of the EIR, and requiring that before further consideration of
11 project approval the city revise and recirculate the EIR, respond to comments, identify
12

13 and adopt feasible mitigations and project alternatives, and make all findings required

14 by CEQA and the Historic Preservation Ordinance, supported by substantial evidence;

15 2. That the Court enjoin the city, real parties, and their employees and agents

16 from all physical actions furthering the project while the petition is pending and after
17

18 judgment pending compliance with the writ;

19 3. For petitioners' reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees pursuant to

20 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

21 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
