22 1.

23 Petitioner Clayton for Responsible Development petitions this Court for a Writ of

24 Mandate, directed to Respondents City of Clayton and City Council of the City of Clayton

25 (*Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' March 3, 2020, approval of The Olivia on

26 Marsh Creek Project (*Project"). The Project is the construction of a 81-Unit Rental Housing

27 Development. Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals for the Project violate the

28 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.,
State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code, sections 65300 et seq.,& 65915; Clayton

Municipal Code, sections 17.37, 7.44, 17.90 and 17.92. -- 1

N m +.00 2. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of
the Project is invalid and void and fails to satisfy the requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA
Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq; is inconsistent with

the City of Clayton's General Plan in violation of the State Planning and Zoning Law,
Government Code section 65300 et seq., violates the Density Bonus provisions of Government
Code section 65915; and violates the City of Clayton's Zoning Code.
PARTIES 8

9 3. Petitioner Clayton for Responsible Development is an unincorporated association

10 comprised of residents of the City of Clayton located in Contra Costa County. Clayton for

11 Responsible Development and its members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in

12 ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, State

13 housing laws, and the City of Clayton Zoning Code. Petitioner's members are affected by

14 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, and other applicable law. Petitioner's members'

15 environmental, aesthetic and property interests will be severely injured if the adoption of the

16 Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other laws. Petitioner

17 brings this Petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to be named

18 and brought before this Court as petitioners. Petitioner is within the class of persons and

19 entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as alleged below.

20 Clayton for Responsible Development was formed after Respondents' approval of the Project.

21 (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177(c).) Members of Clayton for Responsible Development

22 submitted written comments on the Project and appealed the Planning Commission's

23 determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines section 15332.
24 Petitioner's members also participated in the City Council's hearings regarding the Project.

25 Accordingly, Clayton for Responsible Development has standing to sue.

26 4. Respondent City of Clayton is a political subdivision of the State of California and

27 a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. City of Clayton is the CEQA

28 "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the City of Clayton is responsible
2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- ----

2 for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and if
necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
environmental impacts. The City also has principal responsibility for determining whether

vo projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use ordinances and other
applicable laws.

5. Respondent City Council of the City of Clayton is a legislative body duly

co authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

9 behalf of the City of Clayton. Respondent City Council of the City of Clayton is responsible for

10 regulating and controlling land use within the City including, but not limited to, implementing

11 and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of

12 Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable land use ordinances

13 and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City, the City Council

14 establishes overall City priorities and sets policy. The City Council is the governing body of the

15 County and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project.

16 Real Party in William Jordan owns 6170 High Street (Assessor's Parcel Numbers

17 (*APN") 119-021-063) consisting of 1.11 acres; 6450 Marsh Creek Road (APN 119-021-055)

18 consisting of 0.97 acres; and 6490 Marsh Creek Road (APN 119-021-013) consisting of 0.93

19 acres. William Jordan is the Project applicant. The City of Clayton's March 5 2020, Notice of

20 Exemption identifies William Jordan as the Project applicant and recipient of the permits and
approvals for the Project.

21 7.

22 Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and 21

23 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

24 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

25 alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are responsible for all

26 acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents and
Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner

27

28 amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and

Public Resources Code section 21168.5,

9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
California in and for the County of Contra Costa pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the
co Code of Civil Procedure.

BACKGROUND FACTS - 9

10 A. THE PROJECT AND PROJECT SITE

11 10. The Project is 3.02 acres comprised of three lots located at the southwest corner of

12 High Street and Marsh Creek Road. The three lots are: 6170 High Street (APN 119-021-063) -

13 consisting to 1.11 acres; 6450 Marsh Creek Road (APN 119-021-055) consisting of 0.97 acres;
-- 14 and 6490 Marsh Creek Road (APN 119-021-013) consisting of 0.93 acres.

15 11. On September 6, 2017, Real Party in Interest filed an application with the City for
16 The Olivia on Marsh Creek Project. The Project is a multi-family residential development --

17 project at the comer of High Street and Marsh Creek Road on three separate parceis: 6170 High

18 Street, 6450 Marsh Creek Road, and 6490 Marsh Creek Road. The application included a

19 request for the granting of a density bonus pursuant to the State's Density Bonus Law (California)

20 Government Code sections 65915 to 65918) and the City's Affordable Housing Density Bonus

21 Requirements Ordinance (Clayton Municipal Code ("CMC"), Chapter 17.90.) The Project
22 consists of rental units and includes seven affordable units designated for Very Low-Income

23 households as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

24 B. APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

25 12. On November 12, 2019, the City of Clayton Planning Commission held a public

26 hearing on the application which included a request for planning entitlements and an exemption

27 from CEQA for the Project. After an introduction of the Project, discussion and comments from

4 28 the Planning Commission and members of the public, the Commission continued the matter to
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

----s

1 the December 10, 2019 Planning Commission meeting to allow staff to gather further
N m t uo information regarding questions raised at the November 12th hearing and to allow additional
time for public comment.

13. On December 10, 2019, the Planning Commission approved a Resolution that The
Olivia Project qualifies for an CEQA infill exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15332
(Categorical Exemption Class 32, Infill Development Projects). The Planning Commission also
voted 2-2 on a motion to approve the Affordable Housing Density Bonus application, Site Plan

8 Review Permit, and Tree Removal Permit, resulting in a "no decision" action.

9 14. Kent Ipsen, Dan Hummer and Irina and Alexander filed three separate appeals

10 challenging the Planning Commission's approval of a Resolution that the Project qualified for an

11 infill exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15332. Real Party in Interest William Jordan

12 also filed an appeal of Planning Commission's failure to approve the entitlements for the Project.

13 15. On February 4, 2020, the City Council held a hearing on the four appeals. The City

14 Council then continued the hearing to March 3, 2020. On March 3, 2020, the City Council

15 adopted Resolution No. 06-2020 denying the appeals challenging the Planning Commission's

16 approval of the of the CEQA infill exemption. The Council also adopted Resolution No. 07-

17 2020 granting the Real Parties' appeal and approving the Housing Density Bonus Application,

18 Site Plan Review Permit, and Tree Removal Permit.

19 16. On March 5, 2020, Respondents filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk

20 of Contra Costa County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

23 17. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action;

24 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

25 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

26 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written

27 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

- 19. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

2 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative procecdings
m + 1 1o relating to this action.

20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in
effect in violation of State law.

21. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the Notice of

9 Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(d).

10 STANDING

11 22, Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because

12 Petitioner's aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by

13 Respondents' approval of the Project.

14 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

15 23. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

16 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioner's attorneys' fees in actions to
17 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question in
18 this action.

19 CAUSES OF ACTION
20

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion
22 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

23 24. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

24 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 23.

25 25. Respondents' action in determining the Project is categorically exempt constitutes al

26 violation of CEQA in that Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law and their

27 decision to approve the Project based upon a categorical exemption is not supported by

28 substantial evidence.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

26. CEQA Guidelines section 15332, otherwise known as the "infill exemption"
N consists of projects characterized as in-fill development that meet all of the following conditions
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable
w 0D c zoning designation and regulations.
(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has nO value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public
9 services.

10 27. The Project is inconsistent with the City of Clayton's General Plan because it

11 would exceed maximum density rates established under the General Plan by 35%, while at the

12 same time being inconsistent with the City of Clayton's Zoning Code because it would allow

13 41% less onsite parking spaces than is otherwise required by law, and which would also

14 authorize and sanction the removal of multiple large, established, healthy trees from the parcels.
- 15 28. The Project is inconsistent with the Goals and Policies of the General Plan's Land

- 16 Use Element.

17 29. As discussed in more detail below, the Project is also inconsistent with the City's

18 Zoning Ordinance with respect to off-street parking requirements (CMC, § 17.37); the City's

19 Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (CMC, § 17.92); density bonus (CMC, § 17.90); and the Site

20 Permit (CMÇ, § 17.44).

21 30. The Project will likely have significant effect to traffic. For instance, the traffic

22 study and analysis relied upon is significantly outdated and fails to address the Project's traffic

23 and parking impacts to the surrounding neighborhood.

24 31. The Project is also not substantially surrounded by urban uses. On two sides of

25 the Project are parcels zoned "rural estates." Under the zoning map they are designated R-40-
- 26 H, which means among other things that each of those parcels may have horses on them.

27 Property essentially zoned as horse farms is not consistent with "urban uses."

28 32. As Respondents' reliance on the infill categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines, §

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

1 15332) is not supported by substantial evidence, is inconsistent with the City's General Plan -

2

m t  0 A0 and Zoning Code and it is not surrounded by urban uses, approval of the Project constituted a
prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law. -

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion

33. Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.
Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 32.

34.
9 CEQA provides that if there is "reasonable possibility" that an activity will have a -

10 significant effect on the environment due to "unusual circumstances," an agency may not find

11 the activity to be categorically exempt from CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2(c).) The

12. unusual circumstances exception applies when both unusual circumstances and a significant

13 impact as a result of those unusual circumstances are shown. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation

14 City of Berkeley (2015) 60 C4th 1086, 1104.)
35.
15

7 In the present case, unusual circumstances exist such as the Project's inconsistency

16 with the City's General Plan and the City's applicable Zoning Ordinance, as discussed in more

detail below.

17 36.
18 The Project's removal of two dozen or more mature trees also constitutes an

19 unusual circumstance that would cause a significant effect on the environment.

37.
20 As the Project does not qualify for categorical exemption under CEQA,

21 Respondents' approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is
contrary to law.
22

23

24 THIRD CAUSE OF: ACTION

25 (Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.;

38. Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

26 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

27 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 38.

39,

28 The State Planning and Zoning Law prohibits the City from approving the Project
if it conflicts with its General Plan and other applicable land use plans. Local land use and
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

1 development decisions must be consistent with the applicable general plan. (Families Unafraid

2 to Uphold Rural etc. County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336
m v0ON (FUTURE).) "A project is consistent with the general plan "if, considering all its aspects, it
will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." '
[Citation.] A given project need not be in perfect conformity with each and every general plan
policy. [Citation.] To be consistent, a project must be 'compatible with' the objectives,
policies, general land uses and programs specified in the general plan." (Ibid.)
cd 40. The Project is not consistent with the General Plan because it provides for 27 units

9 per acre to be constructed on lands that under the City's General Plan, have a maximum

10 allowable density of 20 units per acre.

11 41, As the Project conflicts with the General Plan and the General Plan, approval of

12 the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.

13

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of City of Clayton Municipal Code § 17.37
15 Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

16 42. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

17 allegation contained in paragraphs I through 41.

18 43. CCM section 17.37 sets forth the City's off-street parking requirements for new

19 land uses. CMC section 17.37.030A states that "off-street parking spaces shall be provided in

20 accordance with Schedule 17.37.030.A. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided for non-

21 residential uses in accordance with Schedule 17.37.030.B or as required by the Planning

22 Commission."

23 44. Based upon the number of units approved for the Project (45 one bedroom units and

24 36 two bedroom units), the Zoning Code section 17.37.030A requires that the Project provide

25 approximately 2.23 onsite parking spaces per unit (i.e. 2.0 parking spaces for each 1 bedroom

26 unit and 2.5 parking spaces for each 2 bedroom unit) for a total of approximately 180 a parking -

27 spaces. The Project includes only 106 onsite parking spaces, which is 41% less than the Zoning

28 Code requires. -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

45. As Respondents' findings are not supported by substantial evidence and the

2 Project's approvals conflict the Zoning Code, approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial
abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of City of Clayton Municipal Code § 17.92 and Government Code, sections 65915, Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

Mc 46. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 45.

47. The City of Clayton's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance sets forth the standards and
9 procedures to facilitate the development and availability of housing affordable to a range of -*

10 households with varying income levels to implement the City's Housing Element and as
11 mandated by Government Code section 65580. (CMC, § 17.92.) §
12 48. The City's approval of the maximum density bonus of 35% violates the City's
13 Zoning Code. (CMC, § 17.92.030.) The "base" Project for which the developer claims
14 entitlement to a density bonus and numerous concessions was claimed to be 60 units. Under the
15 City of Clayton's Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, a developer must allocate ten percent (10%)
16 of the units in the base project to Very Low, Low and Moderate Income Households, without the
17 benefit of financial incentives of any kind. (CMC, §17.92.030.) Accordingly, the developer in
18 this case was legally required to set aside a minimum of six (6) units for Inclusionary Housing
19 before there is any consideration of a density bonus or concessions. The City, however, granted
20 a 35% density bonus resulting in twenty-one (21) additional units, plus multiple incentives,
21 including dramatically reduced park ratios and draconian tree removals, based solely on the
22 developer adding just one (1) additional Very Low Income Housing unit to his prior land use
23 proposal. Out of the 81 total units requested by the developer, only 7 (i.e. only 8.6% of the
24 units), which is less than the mandatory 10% inclusionary housing that is required under the
25 CMC, is sufficient to trigger the bonus density and concessions granting the developer an
26 additional 20 market rate units and concessions.
27 49. The number of very low income housing units necessary to obtain 35% density
28 bonus under Government Code section 65915 and CMC section 17.90.040 should be "9" based|
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

1 on the total number of units in the development including density bonus units, not just "7" based

2 upon the number of original units in the base project. Government Code Section 65915(f)(2)
c0 1 1010 states that in order to receive the maximum density bonus of 35%, the Project must allocate 11% |
of all units in the Project to Very Low Income Housing. Unlike Government Code section
65915(b)(1)(B), which excludes any density bonus units for purposes of determining whether or
a not a proposed development qualifies for a density bonus, section 65915(f)(2), which establishes |
the scale of the density bonus, contains no such exclusion of the density bonus units in its tables

8 or formulae. While the Project may qualify for a minimal density bonus simply by virtue of

9 allocating 5% or more of its "base" units to Very Low Income Housing, in order to obtain the

10 maximum density bonus available for Very Low Income Housing of 35%, Government Code

11 section 65915(b)(1)(B) requires an allocation of 11% of the "total" units in the Project to Very

12 Low Income Housing. Thus, in order to qualify for the requested maximum 35% density bonus,|

13 the Project had to pledge a minimum of 9 units to Very Low Income Housing (11% of 81 units =

14 8.91 units, and Government Code section 65915(f)(5) requires rounding up to the next whole

15 number) - not 7 units as approved by the City, which is 11% of only the "base" number of units.|

16 50. Inclusionary Housing under the CMC and affordable housing qualifying for bonus

17 density under the Government Code must be counted separately. (CMC, § 17.92.030.) The total

18 required Inclusionary Housing under CMC is the sum of the required inclusionary housing

19 determined under CMC and the voluntary number of units allocated to Very Low Income

20 Housing for purposes of obtaining a density bonus. CMC section 17.92.030 requires that

21 Inclusionary Housing should neither be added to nor subtracted from the bonus density housing

22 formulas set forth in Government Code section 69515, which are discussed above. These are

23 entirely separate statutory schemes, with two different purposes.

24 51. As approval of the Project is inconsistent with the requirements for density bonus

25 and inclusionary housing, approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion

26 and is contrary to law.

25 The City's approval of the Site Plan is inconsistent with the standards set forth in

27 The Project allows for the construction of multiple story structures almost to the

28 property lines. As a result, the Project impacts the reasonable maintenance of the privacy of
adjacent property owners and/or occupants. The approved Site Plan will allow future occupants|

of the Project Site to look directly into bedroom windows and backyards of the owners and

2 occupants of adjacent properties. This overburdening of the land eliminates privacy to the

57. As approved, the Project will impact the reasonable maintenance of existing views

eliminate existing viewscapes.

58. The Project is also completely out of character and scale with the existing improved
