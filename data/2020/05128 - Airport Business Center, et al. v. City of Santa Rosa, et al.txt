1. Petitioner and Plaintiff AIRPORT BUSINESS CENTER is a California limited
23

24 partnership, which has its principal place of business in unincorporated Sonoma County and which

25 regularly conducts business in the City of Santa Rosa.

2.
26 Petitioner and Plaintiff BLUE FOX PARTNERS is a California general partnership,

l ABCR-570592347293.2 -1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

3. Respondent and Defendant City of Santa Rosa ("City") is and at all relevant times

2 was a charter city duly organized and existing under and pursuant to the laws of the State of
3 California.

4 4. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of Santa Rosa ("Council") is,
5 and at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the City existing

6 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The Council is, and at relevant times

7 was, the local body charged with, inter alia, amending and enacting legislation governing land use

8 within the City's boundaries and sphere of influence, and conducting, considering, and certifying

9 environmental review of the same, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all applicable
10 federal, state, and local laws.

11 5. Petitioners are unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued
12 herein as DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and will amend this complaint to set forth their true names

13 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioners are informed and believe, and
14 based thereon allege, that some fictitiously named Respondents were the agents and employees of
15 the other fictitiously named, or actually named, Respondents and, acting within the course of scope
16 of such employment or agency, took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are
17 the principals and took some part in such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-
18 named Respondents are liable to Petitioners for the relief prayed for herein.

19 6. Respondents and Defendants identified in paragraphs 3 through 5 above, inclusive,

20 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "Respondents."

21 7. This action challenges the approval by the City of the Downtown Station Area
22 Specific Plan ("DSASP") and certification of the Final Subsequent Environmental Impact Report
23 (*FSEIR") for the DSASP on October 13, 2020. The DSASP imposes wide-ranging changes to
24 the land use designations for Downtown Santa Rosa with the avowed goal of intensifying
25 development in the area covered by the DSASP.

26 8. The DSASP is an update of the original Downtown Station Area Specific Plan
27 adopted in 2007 (*2007 DSASP"). The 2007 DSASP was also accompanied by an EIR (State

28

I ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Clearinghouse no. 2006072104) certified on October 9, 2007 ("2007 EIR"). The FSEIR thus
2 purports to be a subsequent EIR based on the 2007 EIR.

3 9. The DSASP seeks to intensify development in the downtown area of the City. This

4 goes beyond the 2007 version of the DSASP, which did not yield the development the City
5  anticipated. By relying on a subsequent EIR that does not address all of the potential impacts of
6 the new DSASP, the City has failed to adhere to the requirements of the California Environmental
7 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9 10. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
10| Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21167,

11 21168, and 21168.5.

12 11. Venue is proper in the Superior Court for the County of Sonoma in accordance
13 with Code of Civil Procedure section 395 because Respondents and the area covered by the
14 DSASP are located in the County of Sonoma.

15 12. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 394 (actions
16 against a city, county, or local agency) and section 395 (actions generally) because Respondents
17  include a city within the County of Sonoma and because the causes of action alleged in this
18 Petition arose in the County of Sonoma, which is also the location of the area covered by the
19 DSASP.

20 13. Petitioners bring this action because Respondents abused their discretion and failed
21 to proceed in a manner required by law because the FSEIR does not comply with CEQA.

22 14. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the City's full compliance with the law
23 regarding the City's approval of the DSASP and FSEIR, including adhering to the requirements of
24 CEQA. Petitioners have personal, environmental, and other interests which will be severely injured
25 by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA. Petitioners own property in the City that would be
26 subject to the DSASP. Moreover, the DSASP's impacts are necessarily regional in nature, thereby
27 impacting residents throughout Sonoma County.

28

!I ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

15. Petitioners are within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by
2 the City's failure to comply with CEQA and approval of the DSASP. Petitioners have expressed
3 their concerns and objections to the approval of the DSASP and FSEIR in correspondence to the
4 City and at the hearings at which Respondents considered and approved the DSASP and FSEIR.

5 Before approving the DSASP and FSEIR, the City owed a mandatory duty to comply with the legal
6 duties which Petitioners allege were violated. Petitioners have the right to enforce the mandatory
7| duties which CEQA imposes on the City.

co 16. The City is the lead agency for purposes of CEQA compliance.

9 17. Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the City's
10 approval of the DSASP and certification of the FSEIR are final and not subject to further
11 administrative appeal procedures.

12 18. Petitioners exhausted their administrative remedies to the extent required by law by
13 objecting to the approval of the DSASP and certification of the FSEIR in writing as well as verbally
14 and presenting alleged grounds for non-compliance with CEQA to the City prior to the close of the
15 public hearing at which the City considered adoption of the DSASP and certification of the FSEIR.
16 (Tomlinson v. County of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal.4th 281.)

17 19. On October 16, 2020, the City posted a notice of determination for the FSEIR.
18 Petitioners have timely filed this Petition for Writ of Mandate within the period required by Public

19 Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (c).

20 20. Petitioners have caused a Notice of Intent to File Suit to be served on Respondents as
21 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent
22 to File Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

23 21, Petitioners will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Office of the
24 Attorney General for the State of California not more than ten (10) days after the commencement of
25 this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure
26 section 388.

27 22. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general to vindicate their own legal
28 and constitutional rights and those of residents of the City and all others who may be impacted by
ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the DSASP. Petitioners seek, on their own behalf and the behalf of said others, that Respondents
2 obey the clear law, conduct required environmental reviews of their discretionary actions, require
3 appropriate, binding, and feasible mitigation for their significant impacts, and not act in unlawful,
4 bad faith, arbitrary, capricious, and confiscatory fashion in noticing, analyzing, enacting and
5 enforcing local land use legislation.

6 23. For these reasons, and others set forth in this Petition, the Respondent's actions
7 described herein and the DSASP are unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioners therefore

8 request this Court issue a writ of mandate invalidating the DSASP and declaring it, and any actions
9 undertaken thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioners also seek
10 declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and temporary,
11 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the DSASP in any manner.

12 24. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioners, on the one hand,
13 and Respondents, on the other hand, relating to the legal rights of the respective parties. The

14 controversy is well-defined and imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of,
15 judicial determinations at this time is warranted.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of CEQA -

18 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5 -

19 Against All Respondents)

20 25. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 24, above, are hereby incorporated herein by
21 reference as though set forth in full.

22 26. Adoption of the DSASP is a "project" that is subject to CEQA review. The CEQA
23 Guidelines, in relevant part, define "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
24 | resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect
25 physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following: (1) An activity directly
26 undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to... enactment and amendment of
27 zoning ordinances...." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed, under CEQA's

28

| ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- broad definition of a "project," municipal ordinances, laws and regulations affecting the use of land
2 or structures have consistently been held to be CEQA "projects" over the course of many decades.

3 27. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

4 required by law by certifying a legally deficient FSEIR for the DSASP in violation of CEQA. The
5 City's decision is not supported by substantial evidence and the FSEIR fails as an informational
6 document because it failed to analyze numerous significant impacts of the DSASP, including but

7 not limited to the following:
a) Aesthetics. The FSEIR does not include an aesthetics analysis, even though the
DSASP envisions adding 1.3 million square feet of retail uses and thousands of units

10 of additional housing. Considering the fact that the DSASP area comprises the

11 historic downtown area of the City, impacts on aesthetics and historic resources are

12 likely. Moreover, given the current trend away from brick-and-mortar retail and

13 towards online shopping, the DSASP's focus on expansive retail use may give rise to

14 vacant properties and urban decay (discussed at greater length below).

15 b) Air Quality. The FSEIR relies on a skewed baseline analysis. To make an accurate

16 analysis, an EIR must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the

17 project, defining a 'baseline' against which predicted effects can be described and

18 quantified." (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction

19 Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447, citations omitted.) But the Air Quality

20 analysis lacks an appropriate baseline due to the fact that the air quality monitoring

21 station it relied upon is located at 103 Morris Street in Sebastapol, almost six miles

22 from the area covered by the DSASP. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that

23 US 101 effectively bisects the area covered by the DSASP, which entails a much

24 higher effect from traffic-related emissions than would be experienced in Sebastapol,

25 which does not have such a highly used route so close to the monitoring station.

26 Moreover, the FSEIR relies on air quality data from 2016 through 2018, which is out

27 of date and fails to account for increased particulate matter levels due to greater

28 wildfire activity, which has been growing and is likely to continue to do so for the
I ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

foreseeable future. The FSEIR therefore does not properly analyze project-specific

2 and cumulative air quality impacts from the DSASP on sensitive receptors and

3 others in the City.

4 c) Land Use. The FSEIR does not include a land use analysis. It therefore lacks any

5 discussion of the DSASP's consistency with the land use patterns in the remainder of

6 the City, as well as broader zoning and planning policies and standards. The

7 analysis in the FSEIR therefore lacks context for a reader to understand how the Plan

8 might hamper other planning priorities for the City, rendering it defective.
d) Noise. The noise analysis in the FSEIR does not include an appropriate baseline for
10 evaluating the difference between the future of the DSASP area with and without the

11 development contemplated therein.

12 e) Parks and Recreation. The FSEIR does not adequately address increased demand

13 for and usage of park and recreational facilities in the DSASP area. This is

14 particularly problematic given the substantial increase in residential development

15 contemplated under the DSASP and the lack of sites for additional park development

16 in the area covered by the plan.

17 f) Transportation. The transportation analysis in the FSEIR is also defective. It

18 assumed that the "no project" (i.e., the baseline) entailed a full buildout under the

19 2007 DSASP. But the FSEIR also notes that "halfway through the planning period,

20 only 100 out of an envisioned 3,400 housing units and 194,000 out of an envisioned

21 494,000 square feet of office, retail, and institutional uses have been developed."

22 Thus, by assuming full buildout under the 2007 plan, the FSEIR inflates the "no

23 project" comparator and thereby decreases the delta between what is projected under

24 the "no project" scenario and the contemplated buildout under the DSASP as now

25 proposed. This improperly minimizes and understates the transportation-related

26 impacts of the DSASP, contrary to CEQA. In effect, the FSEIR is using an

27 artificially inflated baseline for purposes of the transportation analysis. It is

28 appropriate to assume full buildout under the DSASP for purposes of evaluating the
ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

DSASP's potential impacts, because the DSASP could foreseeably give rise to that

2 level of development and thus that degree of change to the environment. But that
rationale does not apply to a baseline analysis, which ordinarily takes as the

4 "baseline" existing conditions and must do so for the enactment of a plan such as the

5 DSASP. This is especially clear here given the DSASP's raison d'etre is the failure

6 of the 2007 DSASP to yield the expected level of development. In other words, the

7 very premise of the DSASP is a lack of development, directly contrary to the

8 premise in the transportation analysis.
Another problem with the transportation analysis is that it concludes the DSASP will

10 have virtually no traffic-related impacts compared to the no-project alternative, even

11 seeing some intersection level of service improvements. This is despite the fact that

12 the DSASP envisions adding 3,750 residential units, 8,670 residents, and 334,690

13 square feet of commercial development over the existing 2007 DSASP. It is not at

14 all clear from the FSEIR what premises are built in to the analysis to reach this

15 result. It appears to rest on the assumption that greater use of transit and bicycle and

16 pedestrian facilities will reduce traffic as compared to the future no-project scenario.

17 But this is mere unsupported supposition. Moreover, the original 2007 DSASP

18 included a similar emphasis on reducing automobile use. The FSEIR does not

19 explain how the new DSASP improves upon its 2007 predecessor in this regard. It is

20 impossible for the public and decisionmakers to understand the premises and

21 assumptions, evidence, analysis, and conclusions reached on this point, rendering the

22 FSEIR defective under CEQA.

23 With respect to the vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") analysis, the FSEIR notes that

24 "most" of the DSASP area is located within a half mile of a major transit stop or a

25 stop along an existing high-quality traffic corridor. It then relies on the transit mall

26 as meeting this criterion, even though it acknowledges that OPR does not consider

27 the transit mall qualifying as such. Moreover, the VMT analysis in the FSEIR

28 consists of a scant four pages, without any data or analysis to show how the
II ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

conclusions were reached. It appears to show that existing VMT for most of the
DSASP area is 7.7. This is lower than the projected VMT for the DSASP. Thus, by

3 using a citywide VMT average the FSEIR obscures the actual potential impacts of
the Plan. Using the more precise and conservative figure shown in Appendix F, the
FSEIR appears to show a potentially significant increase in VMT under the DSASP,

6 contrary to its conclusions.

7 g) Urban Decay. The DSASP redesignates existing public parking garages such as

co those at 555 First Street and 625 3rd Street to the new "Core Mixed Use" land use
O designation. Core Mixed Use allows for a "mix of residential, retail, office,

10 governmental, entertainment, cultural, educational, and hotel uses." Thus, these

11 existing parking garages could be converted to different uses as a matter of right,

12 eliminating much-needed parking in the area covered by the DSASP. In the event

13 such were to occur, businesses in the vicinity would be forced to relocate as

14 customers will not shop where they cannot park. This concern is driven home by the

15 fact that the DSASP explicitly waives minimum required parking. Virtually by

16 definition, a project that replaces a parking garage cannot provide as much parking

17 as is lost by the replacement; thus, not only would the arca covered by the DSASP

18 lose parking for existing uses, it would also be underparked for the significant

19 additional development the DSASP proposes to add to the area, including upwards

20 of 334,000 square feet of commercial uses. The assertion that this will not occur is

21 not supported by substantial evidence. Even assuming arguendo that the parking

22 supply is eventually bolstered, this does nothing for City businesses during the

23 interim. In order to survive, businesses in the DSASP area must be assured there

24 will be adequate parking on a consistent basis. The DSASP effectively makes the

25 parking garages nonconforming uses, which will inexorably lead to their demise. In

26 this context, California courts have long recognized the existence of "land use

27 decisions that cause a chain reaction of store closures and long-term vacancies,

28 ultimately destroying existing neighborhoods and leaving decaying shells in their
ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 wake," and have invalidated EIRs for failing to take such factors into account.

2 (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124

3 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1204.) The FSEIR is completely silent on this issue, however, a

4 glaring defect that is in and of itself sufficient to render it inadequate under CEQA.

5 h) Water and Wastewater. The FSEIR does not adequately analyze the effects on

6 water supply and wastewater disposal given the significant addition of residential to

7 the DSASP area, including the conversion of existing parking garages. Moreover, it

8 does not adequately address impacts relating to the installation of additional water-

9 related infrastructure or the potential failure to add such infrastructure.

10 i) Alternatives. The FSEIR only includes two alternatives, "no project" and

11 "redistributed growth." This falls short of the 2007 EIR, which also included a

12 "reduced growth" alternative. This violates CEQA as failing to provide reasonable

13 range of alternatives as required by law.

14 28. Given the foregoing, the DSASP may have any number of potentially significant
15 impacts on the environment that are not disclosed or analyzed in the FSEIR.

16 29. Under CEQA, a lead agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it (I) fails to
17 proceed in the manner required by law; or (2) its decision is not supported by the evidence. (Pub.
18  Resources Code, § 21168.5.) Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a
19 manner required by law by approving the DSASP and certifying the FSEIR in a manner that does
20 not comply with the requirements of CEQA, and Petitioners are entitle to the issuance of a writ of

21 mandate setting aside the approval of the DSASP and certification of the FSEIR. Petitioners, as
22 well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is
23 not granted, as the DSASP will be implemented in the absence of a full and adequate

24 environmental review under CEQA.

25 30. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies made available to them to

26 address Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required and not excused, and any further

27 attempts would in any event have been an idle and futile exercise even if available. Petitioners have
28 no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the DSASP and
ABCR-57059\2347293.2 -10-

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 FSEIR, and a writ of mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 is the
2 prescribed remedy for violations of this type. Petitioners are herewith or shortly will be filing and

3 serving on Respondents their election to prepare the administrative record pursuant to Public
4| Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (b)(2), and all other applicable laws. Petitioners have
5 also performed all other conditions precedent to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service of

6 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the
7 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and mail service of the petition on the
8 California Attorney General no more than ten (10) days after its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., § 388).

9 31. The adoption of the DSASP is in violation of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

13 Against All Respondents)

14 32. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 31, above, are hereby incorporated by
15 reference as though set forth in full.

16 33. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioners and the
17 Respondents. Petitioners contend that the DSASP is invalid due to Respondents' failure to follow
18 CEQA. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents contend
19 that the DSASP is valid and enforceable and was properly enacted.

20 34. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the validity of the DSASP. In

21 particular, Petitioners desire a declaration that the DSASP is invalid and unenforceable due to
22 Respondents' failure to follow CEQA.

23 35. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Petitioners
24 and similarly situated persons understand their rights and obligations with respect to the DSASP.

25 36. Petitioners also seek to enjoin Respondents from applying or enforcing the DSASP,

26 and to require that Respondents rescind their approval of the DSASP.
