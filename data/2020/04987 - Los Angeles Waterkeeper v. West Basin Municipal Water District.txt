- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 On November 18, 2019, Respondent West Basin Municipal Water District ("West

4 Basin") violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et

5 seq.) by certifying a legally inadequate Environmental Impact Report and approving the

6 construction and operation of a desalination facility (the "Project") on the shore of Santa Monica

7 Bay (Resolutions 11-19-1105 and 11-19-1106, respectively). Petitioner Los Angeles

8 Waterkeeper ("Waterkeeper" or "Petitioner") brings this action to challenge West Basin's

9 failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA, and its violation of the California Public
Trust.

10 2.

11 In approving this Project, West Basin endorsed a 1970 answer to a 2020 water

12 supply question, at the expense of the requirements of CEQA, the California Public Trust, the

13 Ocean Plan, and the environmental and climate goals of California.
3.

14 The Project consists of a 20 million gallons per day ("MGD") desalination facilityl

15 using open-ocean intakes. This outdated intake design requires the Project to suck in more than

16 40 million gallons of water every day through enormous intake pipes in Santa Monica Bay (the

17 "Bay"), covered only by wire screens, to produce 20 MGD of potable water. As the Project

18 sucks in vast volumes of water, it will inevitably kill organisms unlucky enough to become

19 impinged or entrained against the intake screens, including the larval foundations of the Bay's
marine ecosystem.

20 4.

21 After the Project sucks in the 40 million gallons of seawater each day, it will

22 employ an energy-intensive and economically costly process to extract salt and other impurities

23 from the water. This process will draw as much energy as a small city and produce more than 20

24 million gallons each day of a highly concentrated brine and anti-fouling agent waste. West Basin

25 will dump this waste into the Bay through a diffuser pipe where the waste will harm fish and
wildlife habitat.

26 5.

27 The harms from impingement and entrainment of fauna against the intake screens

28 The EIR contemplates potentially expanding the Project to a Regional size of 60 MGD; however, the EIR only includes a program-level analysis of that project.

2

and from the toxicity of the brine waste will be significant for the marine ecosystem. The

2 Project's 1-millimeter screens might prevent adult fish from being impinged and entrained by

3 the intakes, but they will provide no protection to marine larvae, including the larvae of

4 endangered species.

5 6. Further, brine discharges introduce acute and chronic toxicity to marine

6 ecosystems. West Basin does not adequately analyze these potential harms in its Environmental

7 Impact Report ("EIR").

8 7. The Project's adverse impacts on land will be equally detrimental. The Project will

9 be located on the shore of Santa Monica Bay in El Segundo. There, the Project will be exposed
10 to hazards from sea-level rise, will violate the E1 Segundo Local Coastal Program, will produce
11 significant greenhouse gas emissions that are far out of step with California's plans to combat
12 climate change, will harm environmental justice, and will require enormous amounts of energy
13 to operate.

14 8. Despite these evident negative impacts, the EIR fails to adequately analyze these
15 issues or propose appropriate mitigation. Instead, the EIR attempts to sweep the Project's
16 adverse effects under the proverbial rug, claiming that the Project, as approved, would have no
17 significant operational environmental impacts.
18 9. In an effort to justify the Project in the face of these significant harmful impacts,
19 West Basin attempted to eliminate the available alternatives through the use of unduly narrow
20 Project Objectives. Without supporting evidence, West Basin claimed the superficial difficulties
21 in obtaining other water sources were insurmountable. This wholesale rejection of everything
22 except desalination led to an EIR where every alternative, apart from the "no-build" alternative,

23 consists of an open-ocean intake desalination facility.
24 10. This inadequate EIR represents the culmination of a decades-long push by West
25 Basin to bring a desalination facility into being, regardless of the need for one. West Basin's

26 own documents demonstrate that the claimed need the Project would satisfy has never
27 materialized. Moreover, the myriad water supply alternatives are feasible and far less harmful.
28 Nonetheless, West Basin certified the EIR and approved the Project because it long ago made

3

1 clear that its primary goal was to build a desalination facility.

2 11. For these reasons and others described herein, Waterkeeper seeks a writ of

3 mandate vacating the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 12. This Court has jurisdiction over the CEQA writ action under sections 1094.5 and

6 section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This Court also has jurisdiction over the CEQA

7 writ action under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

8 13. This Court has jurisdiction over the Public Trust writ action under section 1085 of

9 the Code of Civil Procedure.

10 14. This Court has jurisdiction because Waterkeeper has fully exhausted its

11 administrative remedies and because Waterkeeper has a beneficial interest in West Basin's a

12 compliance with CEQA.

13 15. This Court has jurisdiction because Waterkeeper has a beneficial interest in West

14 Basin's compliance with its duties as a trustee of resources subject to protection under the

15 Public Trust, and compliance with its duties as grantee of rights to property subject to the
16 Public Trust.

17 16. This Court has jurisdiction because this action is timely filed under Public

18 Resources Code Section 21167 subdivisions (b) and (c).

19 17. Venue is proper in Los Angeles County under Code of Civil Procedure Section
20 394, because West Basin is a governmental district situated in Los Angeles County.

21 18. Waterkeeper has standing to bring this action.

22 PARTIES

23 19. Waterkeeper is a non-profit organization incorporated under the laws of the State

24 of California with members who live and recreate throughout the Los Angeles area, including

25 in West Basin's service area. Founded in 1993 as Santa Monica BayKeeper, Waterkeeper's

26 mission is to promote and protect the health of all coastal and inland water resources in Los

27 Angeles County and ensure a sustainable water supply for the Los Angeles Region. Through

28 advocacy, education, community action, and where necessary, litigation, Waterkeeper strives to

4

F ensure its members and all Los Angeles residents have access to healthy, safe, and
2 environmentally sensitive waters and water sources both inland and in Santa Monica Bay.
3 20. Respondent West Basin is a governmental district and wholesale water agency that
4 provides water to 17 cities2 within Los Angeles County, serving a combined population of over
5 800,000 people. West Basin is governed by an elected 5-member board, with each board
6 member representing a division within the service area. Board Members serve four-year terms.
7 (Cal. Water Code §§ 71250; 71252.) West Basin is also a member of the Metropolitan Water
8 District of Southern California. West Basin is the Lead Agency for the Project.
9 21. Waterkeeper is unaware of the true names of Real Parties in Interest 1 through 10
10 at this time, and accordingly names them as DOES 1-10 until such time as the true name of
11 each party so named is discovered.

12 LEGAL STANDARDS

13

14 Goals CEQA Advances Both Environmental Protection and Governmental Transparency

22. 15 CEQA serves the dual purposes of environmental protection and informed self-

16 government. (Citizens of Goleta Valley V. Bd. Of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564.) The

17 Legislature intended for CEQA "to be interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest

18 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."

19 (Friends of Mammoth v. Bd. Of Supervisors of Mono County 8 Cal. 3d 247, 259.) The EIR,
which includes a detailed assessment of potentially significant environmental impacts and an 20

21 analysis of reasonable alternatives and mitigation measures, is "the heart of CEQA" and the

22 most important mechanism by which the statutory goals of CEQA are given effect. (Laurel

23 Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of the University of California (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112,

24 1123.)

23. Before an 25 agency approves a non-exempt project subject to CEQA, the Lead

26 Agency must conduct a CEQA review. (14 Cal. Code Regs. (hereafter "Guidelines")

27
Carson; Culver City; El Segundo; Gardena; Hawthorne; Hermosa Beach; Inglewood; Lawndale; Lomita; Malibu; 28 Manhattan Beach; Palos Verdes Estates; Rancho Palos Verdes; Redondo Beach; Rolling Hills; Rolling Hills Estates; and West Hollywood.

5

1 § 15004(b); § 15352; Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 128-129.)

2 CEQA prohibits a lead agency from approving a project that may have a significant impact on

3 the environment without first preparing, considering, and certifying an adequate EIR. (Save

4 Tara, supra, 45 Cal. 4th at 121.)

5 24. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public with detailed

6 information about the effects that a proposed project is likely to have on the physical

7 environment. (Pub. Resources Code § 21061.) An EIR must fully disclose and analyze all of a

8 project's potentially significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. (Pub.

9 Resources Code § 21100 subd. (b)(1); Guidelines § 15064(d).) The EIR must contain enough

10 analysis to provide the decision makers with the information necessary for them to intelligently
11 account for the environmental impacts of a project when rendering a decision on project

12 approval. (Guidelines § 15151.) The Lead Agency must make a best effort to "find out and

13 disclose all it reasonably can." (Guidelines § 15144.)

14 25. In addition to the Lead Agency, Responsible and Trustee Agencies play a key role
15 in developing the scope of EIRs and the topics on which the Lead Agency must "find out and

16 disclose" relevant information on environmental impacts. Responsible and Trustee Agencies

17 have an obligation to comment to the Lead Agency on the scope and substance of EIRs. (Pub.

18 Resources Code § 21080.4 subd. (a); see also Guidelines § 15082; Guidelines § 15086 subd.

19 (a)(1).)

20 26. Once the Responsible and Trustee Agencies have commented on matters within

21 their jurisdiction or expertise, the Lead Agency has a duty to prepare an EIR that is responsive

22 to the concerns raised by Responsible and Trustee Agencies. (Pub. Resources Code § 21080.4

23 subd. (a), [information germane to statutory responsibilities of Responsible and Trustee
24 Agencies "shall be included in the environmental impact report" emph. added].)

25 27. The EIR must contain the analyses requested by Responsible and Trustee Agencies

26 in comments (Guidelines § 15096 subd (b)(2).) As Lead Agency, West Basin's duty to "find

27 out and disclose" information germane to Responsible and Trustee Agencies persists
28 throughout the entire CEQA process. (Pub. Resources Code. § 21003 subd. (a); Banning Ranch,

6

supra, 2 Cal. 5th at 919, 939, 942; Save San Francisco Bay Association v. San Francisco Bay
2 Conservation and Development Commission (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 908, 922.)
3 28. The Lead Agency's duty includes determining whether an environmental effect is

4 adverse. The Lead Agency must consider "direct physical changes in the environment which
5 may be caused by the project and reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the

6 environment which may be caused by the project. (Guidelines § 15064 subd. (d).) A direct
7 physical change is "caused by and immediately related to the project"; an indirect change
8 occurs if a direct change in turn causes another change. (Guidelines § 15064 subd. (d)(1); subd.
9 (d)(2).)

10 29. In conjunction with analyzing adverse effects, the EIR must include a reasonable
11 range of alternatives to a proposed project that will reduce or avoid significant environmental
12 impacts of the project and foster informed decision making and public participation.
13 (Guidelines § 15126.6.)

14 30. During the preparation of the EIR, the Lead Agency must notify and consult with
15 Responsible Agencies and Trustee Agencies. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21104; 21153;
16 21092.1.)

17 31. Further, the Lead Agency must prepare the EIR in a manner that integrates the
18 CEQA environmental analysis with the environmental review processes of other public
19 agencies to the fullest possible extent. (Pub. Resources Code §21003 subd. (a) (emph. added);
20 Guidelines §§ 15006; 15080; 15124 subd. (d)(1)(C).) It is a prejudicial abuse of discretion if a
21 Lead Agency's failure to integrate CEQA analysis with other review processes results in a
22 substantial impairment to the informational value of the EIR. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v.
23 City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal. 5th 919, 939, 942.) Integration of CEQA requirements
24 with other environmental processes helps inform the alternatives analysis and evaluate
25 mitigation measures. (Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta (1988) 198 Cal. App.
26 3d 433, 442, fn. 8.)
27 32. Along with incorporating the needs and comments of Responsible and Trustee
28 Agencies, the Lead Agency must also address comments from the public. The Lead Agency

7

-

2 must provide the public with the opportunity to voice comments on the project and it must

3 prepare responses to those comments timely received. The Lead Agency's responses must meet
all applicable requirements for the preparation of an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code § 21092.5;
4 Guidelines § 15088.) Further, the written responses must describe the disposition of significant

5

6 environmental issues raised. (Guidelines § 15088 subd. (c).) When the Lead Agency position

7 varies from recommendations or objections in written comments, its responses must be detailed

8 and specific and employ good faith, reasoned analysis. The Lead Agency may not rely upon
unsupported, conclusory statements. (Ibid.)

9 II.

10 The California Public Trust Requires Consideration of Impacts to Trust Resources

11 as Part of Project Development, Approval, and Operation

33.

12 California's navigable waterways and submerged lands are held in trust for the

13 People of California. (People v. Monterey Fish Products Co. (1925) 195 Cal. 548, 563.) The

14 People thus have a property right in trust lands. Additionally, the People of California own the
waters of Santa Monica Bay. (Cal. Water Code 102.)

15 34.

16 Santa Monica Bay is itself a Public Trust resource (consisting of submerged lands

17 under a navigable waterway) and supports a number of trust uses, including navigation, fishing,
public beaches, recreation, and fish and wildlife habitat.

18 35. The State Lands Commission is the trustee charged with primary administration of
19 Public Trust resources. As a trustee of the Public Trust, it must ensure that actions that may
20 adversely affect Public Trust resources incorporate "a full consideration of the state's public

21

22 interest in the matter." (Pub. Resources § Code § 6009 subd. (b); San Francisco Baykeeper v.

23 California State Lands Commission (2015) 242 Cal. App. 4th 202, 234.)
36.

24 The State Lands Commission must also evaluate the potential for harm to public

25 trust resources, including from the extraction of water resources for consumptive use.

37.

26 West Basin must obtain a grant of approval from the State Lands Commission for

27 use of both the submerged lands and the waters of Santa Monica Bay.
38.

28 West Basin's proposed use of the public water supply of Santa Monica Bay for the
Project is not a Public Trust use. (National Audubon, supra, 33 Cal. 3d at 440-41.) Thus, the

8

State Lands Commission can grant West Basin, at most, a usufructuary right to the water

2 resources protected by the Public Trust.

3 39. West Basin seeks rights to use both water resources in Santa Monica Bay and
4 other resources (including submerged lands) protected by the Public Trust; however, the State
5 Lands Commission cannot transfer those rights to West Basin from the People of California

6 without finding that such a grant would result in "the improvement of the public interest thus
7 held," or that the grant of usufructuary rights under the Water Code or rights to otherwise use

8 Public Trust resources would not impair "the public interest in the lands or waters remaining.'
9 (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 419, 438.) The State Lands
10 Commission also must ensure that any grant of rights to use Public Trust resources will "not
11 interfere with the trust upon which such lands are held or substantially impair the right to
12 navigation and fishing." (Pub. Resources § Code $ 6009 subd. (c).)
13 40. While the State Lands Commission, rather than West Basin, must determine

14 whether to grant rights to use Public Trust resources for the Project, (Pub. Resources Code

15 6009 subd. (b)), the Public Trust also creates broadly applicable duties that West Basin must
16 undertake.

17 41. Along with the State Lands Commission, as a public agency West Basin is
18 obligated to consider impacts on Public Trust resources as part of any project evaluation.
19 Similarly, West Basin is subject to duties to "consider and disclose" information that overlap
20 with similar requirements under CEQA. West Basin must incorporate these considerations into
21 its project analysis. Public agencies have "an affirmative duty to take the Public Trust into
22 account in the planning and allocation of water resources" (National Audubon, supra, 33 Cal.
23 3d at 446), and must build an administrative record sufficient to allow for judicial review. (San
24 Francisco Ecology Center v. City and County of San Francisco (1975) 48 Cal. App. 3d, 584,
25 596.) "Information scattered here and there .. is not a substitute for a good faith reasoned a
26 analysis." (Vineyard Area Citizens v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 412, 442.)
27 Relatedly, an agency must make findings "to bridge the analytic gap between raw evidence and
28 ultimate decision." (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. City of Los Angeles (1974)

9

11 Cal. 3d 506, 515.)

2 42. Despite its overlap with CEQA, compliance with CEQA does not automatically

3 fulfill an agency's Public Trust obligations. Violations of CEQA and violations of the Public

4 Trust constitute separate causes of action. (San Francisco Baykeeper v. California State Lands

5 Commission (2015) 242 Cal. App. 4th 202.)

6 43. An EIR must undertake its analysis of alternatives, impacts, and mitigation in the

7 context of requirements of other relevant regulatory programs and integrate those requirements

8 into its own review to the fullest possible extent, even if the ultimate decision under that other
program is not within the control of the Lead Agency preparing the EIR. (Pub. Res. Code

10 § 21003 subd. (a); Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal. 5th 919 [Coastal Commission held final
11 decision-making authority on question of existence of environmentally sensitive habitat area on

12 proposed project site; nonetheless "untenable" for Lead Agency to ignore substantial evidence
13 such areas existed within project site and omit discussion of issue in EIR].)

14 44. Furthermore, grantees of rights in Public Trust resources have an ongoing

15 obligation to "prevent subjugation of statewide interests" in the exercise of any rights granted.

16 (Pub. § Resources Code § 6009 subd. (d).) The rights granted must be exercised so as not to

17 impair "the public interest in the lands or waters remaining." (National Audubon Society v.

18 Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 419, 438.) In other words, the public rights in Public Trust

19 lands and resources must always remain paramount, and the recipient of any approval for use of
20 Public Trust lands must ensure that the use does not diminish or waste the corpus of the trust.

21 45. Thus, any grant of rights in trust resources by the State Lands Commission to West

22 Basin would affirmatively trigger the inchoate duty of West Basin to prevent subjugation. This

23 duty to prevent subjugation would exist in addition to the duties West Basin already has as a
24 public agency to consider the impacts of its proposed actions on Public Trust resources.

25 STATEMENT OF FACTS

26 Background

27 A. West Basin Municipal Water District

28 46. West Basin Municipal Water District is a water wholesale agency managed by a

10

F five-member Board of Directors.

2 47. West Basin supplies water to agencies and municipalities serving approximately
3 800,000 people in 17 cities in Los Angeles County. The customer-cities of West Basin are

4 diverse and include some of the wealthiest communities in Los Angeles County as well as some

5 recognized as 100% disadvantaged communities3. Much of the Project conveyance

6 infrastructure will be located in these disadvantaged communities.

7 48. Across West Basin's service area water usage rates vary significantly. For
8 example, water usage rates in Hawthorne are approximately 65 gallons per person per day,

9 while Palos Verdes usage rates are more than 170 gallons per person per day.
10 B. Project History

11 49. The certification of the EIR and approval of the Project were the culmination of a
12 decades-long push by West Basin a to build a desalination facility. Despite only formally
13 initiating CEQA review of a desalination facility in 2015, West Basin has been actively
14|| pursuing a desalination facility in or near El Segundo for more than 15 years, and it has spent
15 more than $63 million dollars of ratepayer funds trying to justify its commitment to
16 desalination. West Basin has continued this crusade for a desalination facility even as the
17 demand for its water supplies has fallen short of its predictions.

18 50. In 2013, West Basin released its "Program Master Plan" for desalination, which
to facilitate the addition of 19 was not subject to CEQA review. The Master Plan's purpose was
20 desalination facilities to West Basin's supply portfolio. The Master Plan included a Chapter on
21 "next steps," which described the environmental review process as evaluating alternative
22 designs for desalination plants. Thus, long before any CEQA analysis had been completed,
23 West Basin announced its intention to reduce its upcoming CEQA review to post hoc
24 justification for a desalination facility.

25 51. In 2015, West Basin released an Urban Water Management Plan, a planning
26

27 CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately
28 burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution. A disadvantaged community is defined as one located in the top 25% most impacted census tracts in CalEnviroScreen 3.0.

11

-

2 document that West Basin is obligated to prepare every five years by the Water Code.
52.

3 In the 2015 Urban Water Management Plan, West Basin forecasts its total water

4 demand out to 2040, states that it expects imported water use to decrease by 15%, and claims to

5 need desalination to make up the shortfall. However, West Basin's own projections demonstrate

6 that the additional claimed need for 21,500 acre feet would not materialize unless imported

7 water supplies decreased by more than 25%. Even then, however, there are reasonable and less
harmful alternatives than the Project to meet such a demand.

8 53.

9 Moreover, given the state conservation bills that have recently been signed into

10 law (Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606) and the disparities among West Basin's

11 customer's water usage, the alleged shortfall of water supplies and the alleged need for a new

12 water supply described in the Project Objectives can be met through other less harmful means

13 than desalination, including conservation and expanded water recycling.
54.

14 Further, as desalinated water is more expensive and has more significant negative
impacts to climate and energy use than imported water (or any

15 other water source), the Project

16 fails to meet the Project Objective that it be environmentally responsible and economically
viable.

17 55.

18 In 2015, West Basin issued a Notice of Preparation for an EIR.

56.

19 57. Waterkeeper submitted comments on the Notice of Preparation.

20 In March 2018, West Basin released the draft Environmental Impact Report

21 ("Draft EIR"). At the request of Waterkeeper and others, West Basin extended the comment

22 deadline to June 25, 2018. The comments West Basin received enumerated the significant flaws
in the EIR. The final EIR did not address or resolve those comments.

23 58.

24 Both prior to and during the CEQA process, West Basin's Board of Directors

25 made its commitment to desalination publicly known. In 2015, around the time the Notice of

26 Preparation was issued, West Basin's website prominently announced its "commitment to
ocean desalination" at the top open

of its main web page.

27 West Basin's EIR-specific website

28 contained a discussion of CEQA that completely omitted the mention of alternatives analysis as
part of CEQA review.

12

59. Additional evidence of West Basin's commitment to desalination abounds. West

2 Basin Board Members created and prominently wore buttons proclaiming their support of
3 desalination. Additionally, as recently as 2019, the password to the guest Wi-Fi at West Basin

4 headquarters was "oceandesal." West Basin Board Members also actively engaged with the
5 "Cal Desal" organization, "the only advocacy group in California dedicated solely to advancing
6 the responsible development of desalination . . . .$4

7 60. s is clear from the lack of analysis of impacts and West Basin's refusal to engage
8 with comments pointing out the flaws of the EIR, West Basin's EIR represents nothing more
9 than a post hoc justification for a desalination facility. The EIR utterly fails as an informational
10 document, and it frustrates CEQA's dual goals of environmental protection and transparent,
11 informed self-government.

12 C. The Project
13 1. Project Site

14 61. The Project consists of a 20 million gallons per day ("MGD") facility to desalinate
15 seawater using an open-ocean intake and discharge system and a water conveyance system that
16 will extend into El Segundo, Los Angeles, Gardena, Hawthorne, Lawndale, Redondo Beach,
17 and areas of unincorporated Los Angeles County.
18 62. The Project will be located on the northern side of the former 33-acre El Segundo
19 Generating Station at 301 Vista del Mar, El Segundo, California. The Project site is adjacent to
20 45th Street in Manhattan Beach and separated from the sands of El Segundo beach and the
21 forecast sea-level rise only by a bicycle path.
22 2. Technology

23 63. The Project will extract more than 40 million gallons of seawater every day from
24 Santa Monica Bay in order to produce 20 million gallons of desalinated water.
25 64. The Project will employ the outdated technology of open-ocean intakes, meaning
26 that the intake pipes from the facility will extend into the open water of Santa Monica Bay

2 covered only by a 1-millimeter copper wedgewire screen that will leach copper into and

3 significantly impact the marine ecosystem. Copper is already a contaminant of concern in Santa

4 Monica Bay as it is toxic to phytoplankton and other aquatic vegetation. The introduction of

5 additional copper will negatively impact the food chain that subsists on these sources, in turn
affecting the entire aquatic ecosystem.

6 65. Responsible Agency Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board
7 requested that the EIR evaluate self-cleaning stainless steel wedgewire screens to eliminate the

8

9 potential impacts of copper leaching into the water from the proposed copper intake screens.
West Basin refused to conduct this analysis.

10 66,

11 Additionally, the open-ocean intakes themselves pose a significant threat to marine

12 ecosystems. In 2015, the California State Water Resources Control Board enacted the Ocean

13 Plan Amendment ("Ocean Plan") that requires that subsurface intakes instead be used unless

14 the State Water Board determines they are infeasible. Subsurface intakes sit below the sand in a

15 water body and thus do not pose the risks of entrainment or impingement of marine life that
open-ocean intakes pose.

16 67.

17 The Ocean Plan establishes Water Quality Objectives for California's territorial

18 sea, including specific requirements related to the siting and design of desalination facilities.

19 The Ocean Plan requires West Basin to "evaluate a reasonable a range of nearby sites, including

20 sites that would likely support subsurface intakes" and to use subsurface intakes unless the State

21 Water Board staff determines they are not feasible. (California Ocean Plan, §§ III.M.2(b),

22 III.M.2(d) (emphasis added).) Instead, West Basin chose to analyze only the El Segundo
Generating Station in the final EIR, which it selected based on the purported ability to use the
23 already-existing open-ocean intakes at that site.

24 68.

25 Outside of the "no build" alternative, the EIR alternatives analysis consisted

26 exclusively of three desalination facilities with open-ocean intakes, and two of those sites were
located at the El Segundo Generating Station.

27 69.

28 The EIR concluded that subsurface intakes would be infeasible at the El Segundo
Generating Station site. But, because the EIR only evaluated the feasibility of subsurface

14

F intakes at the E1 Segundo Generating Station and neglected to evaluate other sites where
2 subsurface intakes would likely be feasible, the EIR does not comply with the Ocean Plan.
3 70. The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board found that the Draft EIR
4 did not "provide enough information to support a finding that [the evaluated Project sites] are
5 the best available sites for minimizing intake and mortality of all forms of life from a surface
6 intake." (EIR at 13-37.)
7 71. Once seawater is pulled into the facility, salt and other impurities need to be
8 removed. The process of removing salt from seawater is so energy-intensive that desalinated

9 water is the most energy-intensive water source available in California.

10 72. After extracting salt and other impurities from the seawater, the Project would be
11 left with 20 MGD of potable water, 20.9 million gallons of a concentrated brine solution twice
12 the salinity of seawater, and 4.5 million gallons of treated backwash water. (Draft EIR at 3-13.)
13 Every day, the Project would then spew more than 20 million gallons of highly concentrated
14 and toxic brine into Santa Monica Bay.
15 73. This continual discharge of toxic contaminants will produce shear stress and other
16 impacts on marine life that West Basin has not adequately analyzed or mitigated in its EIR.
17 74. The effects of intake and brine discharge on larval populations in Santa Monica
18 Bay also may harm the recruitment of new individuals to populations of important fish and
19 invertebrates including halibut, croaker, California Sheephead, lobster and squid. Additionally,
20 while adult individuals of endangered species like black abalone may not exist in the small
21 study area chose by West Basin, they are found in neighboring areas. Thus, the larvae of
22 endangered species may be subject to the harmful effects of open-ocean intakes.
23 75. The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board found that the Draft EIR
24 did not "provide enough information to support a finding that [the evaluated Project sites] are
25 the best available sites for minimizing intake and mortality of all forms of life from a surface a

26 intake." (EIR at 13-37.)
27 76. Further, prior to the final EIR, 12-foot diameter by 20-foot-long concrete plugs
28 were installed in the intake and discharge pipes at the El Segundo Generating Station by the

15

1 power plant operator. Thus, those plugs must be removed prior to use of the existing pipes by

2 the Project. The EIR does not adequately analyze the impacts resulting from the additional

3 construction needed to remove the plugs or provide adequate mitigation for those impacts.

4 D. Project Construction

5 1. Facility

6 77. Construction of the Project will take up to 72 months, with an estimated

7 completion date of 2027, if construction begins in 2021. During this time, the construction

8 impacts will be substantial.

9 78. The construction will consist of approximately six months of demolition, 15

10 months of site excavation and preparation, and 32 months of actual facility construction.

11 79. Construction will occur on weekdays from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with

12 construction workers beginning trips before 7:00 a.m. on workdays. Additionally, West Basin
13 foresees at least some activity will occur overnight to accommodate oversize loads.

14 80. West Basin anticipates that during demolition, there will be 30 worker commute

15 trips per day and 5,715 one-way haul trips.

16 81. West Basin anticipates that during site work on the facility, there will be around 20

17 worker trips per day and more than 65,000 one-way haul trips.

18 82. All of this increased activity would need to occur either through an access road

19 along the facility or via the major roads including Vista Del Mar and Imperial Highway.

20 2. Open-Ocean Intake and Discharge Pipes

21 83. In order to use the existing intake and discharge pipes at the site, West Basin will

22 need to demolish the added concrete plugs and install five new 42-inch pipes in the intake

23 tunnel and additional header pipes and risers. The openings of the new intake pipes would lie

24 18 feet below the surface of Santa Monica Bay and 13 feet above the sea floor.

25 84. These construction activities would require removal of riprap currently
26 surrounding the site and temporary stockpiling of the riprap on the ocean floor or in barges.

27 85. West Basin would also need to dredge the ocean floor to expose and access the
28 existing intake structure. As the sediment on the Santa Monica Bay seafloor is contaminated

16

1 with harmful chemicals including DDT, the disturbance of the seafloor has the potential to
2 release these toxins back into the Bay and harm water quality. The EIR assumes that the
3 sediment will not be contaminated and declines to analyze the effects of disposing of sediment
4 on land in the event contaminants are found.

5 86. The EIR states that this construction would take approximately one year,
6 consisting of work 5 days per week during daylight hours and would include vessel anchoring,
7 dredging, riprap removal and re-installation, intake modifications and pile driving. The
8 construction equipment will consist of a large derrick barge (150 feet wide by 300 feet long)
a with a crane on deck between a 120-ton and 300-ton class. Smaller boats would be used to

10 shuttle workers from shore to the site twice daily. Additional trips by tug and transport barges
11 would be necessary to bring materials to and from the site.
12 87. These ships would need to anchor to the sea floor, along with temporary mooring
13 buoys.

14 88. Approximately 15 days of pile driving will be needed to install the necessary piles.
15 The piles will be driven into the seafloor with a vibratory driver/extractor that operates at
16 sufficient frequency to liquefy the soil around it; however, an impact hammer may also be
17 employed to complete the installation of the piles.
18 3. Conveyance Infrastructure

19 89. Construction of the conveyance infrastructure that will extend into El Segundo,
20 Los Angeles, Gardena, Hawthorne, Lawndale, Redondo Beach, and areas of unincorporated
21 Los Angeles County will take approximately 30 months.
22 90. Construction activities will occur five days per week from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.

23 The construction will include the installation of up to 9.3 miles of pipeline, some requiring a
24 disturbance corridor of up to 35 feet.

25 91. There are six potential jack-and-bore locations of approximately 5,000 square feet

26 each.

27 92. The demolition phase, lasting 500 working days, will require 15 worker commute
28 trips per day and 6,310 one-way haul trips.

17

93. The excavation, trenching, jack-and-boring/directional drilling phase will last 500

2 working days and include 20 worker commute trips per day and 29,313 one-way haul trips.

3 94. The paving phase, lasting 450 working days, will require approximately 15 worker

4 commute trips per day.

5 E. Project Operation

6 95. Once constructed, the Project will operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year and

7 be staffed around the clock by approximately 20 West Basin employees.

8 96. Operation of the Project will require routine deliveries of chemicals to the site and

9 the hauling of residual materials from the site during normal day-shift hours during the work

10 week.

11 97. Instead of utilizing self-cleaning screens on the open ocean intakes, West Basin

12 will employ a crew of five divers to make up to 11 trips per year in a dive vessel to prevent too

13 much biofouling of the copper screens.5

14 98. Ocean water desalination is the most energy intensive and climate-impacting

15 means of obtaining potable water. The energy demand of the Project will equate to adding an

16 additional 18,185 homes, essentially city twice the size of nearby Hermosa Beach, to the

17 electrical grid.

18 99. Additionally, the operation of the project will contribute an estimated 44,000

19 metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere every year.

20 II. The EIR Did Not Adequately Analyze the Impacts of the Project, Adequately

21 Analyze Feasible Alternatives, or Propose Adequate Mitigation Measures

22 A. The EIR Did Not Evaluate a Reasonable Range of Alternatives
23 100. The EIR fatally suffers from an unreasonably narrow and constrained range of
24 alternatives. Only the "no build" alternative evaluates anything other than an open-ocean-intake
25 desalination facility, and two of the three desalination sites are located on the 33-acre property
26

27

28 5 Biofouling is the accumulation of marine organisms and their parts, plants, and algae on the
intakes.

18

of the El Segundo Generating Station site.

2 101. West Basin's EIR outlines five Project Objectives that are disclosed as such in the
3 EIR Project Description:
A ut a. "Diversify West Basin's water source portfolio to increase reliability in the
near and intermediate term (5-15 years) and the long term (15-30 years) while
6 reducing reliance on imported water";

7 b. "Improve water security through West Basin's increased local control of water

8 supplies and infrastructure";
-3 O C. "Improve West Basin's local control of future water costs and long-term price
stability"
d. "Improve climate resiliency by developing a water source that is less
12 susceptible to hydrologic variability"; and
13 e. "Develop a potable water supply that is economically viable and
14 environmentally responsible"
15 102. Although these Project Objectives appear reasonable at first glance, West Basin
16 interprets the Project Objectives in an unduly narrow manner to eliminate otherwise feasible
17 alternatives to the Project. West Basin does this through the use of qualifiers and/or additional
18 requirements as "shadow objectives" that appear nowhere in the Project Objectives or broader
19 Project Description themselves. The use of such undisclosed "shadow objectives" also
20 destabilizes the Project Description. An unduly narrow interpretation of Project Objectives has
21 been repeatedly rejected in published opinions. (See, e.g., Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of
22 Woodside (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 587; Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose
23 (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1336, 1352; Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007) 157
24 Cal. App. 4th 1437, 1460; In Re Bay Delta Coordinated Environmental Impact Report
25 Proceedings (2008) 43 Cal. 4th 1143, 1166.)
26 103. First, West Basin rejects alternatives because West Basin would not have total
27 control over the water supply (i.e., without first entering into an agreement to secure the
28 appropriate water rights from another public agency.) Total control is not a Project Objective

19

- listed by West Basin for the Project.

2

3 104. Second, West Basin rejects a hybrid approach by relying on a "shadow objective"

4 that the water source produce 21,500 acre feet of water per year from a single new source of

5 water. This number originates from the 2015 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP), a water

6 supply planning document prepared pursuant to the Water Code by West Basin. UWMPs are

7 not subject to CEQA review. The Project Objectives do not include a requirement that the

8 Project produce 21,500 acre feet per year of potable water.

9 105. West Basin also rejects alternatives on the basis that the entire claimed demand

10 must be met by single source, though nowhere is this criterion enumerated in the Project

11 Objectives. By utilizing this shadow objective, West Basin rejects the use of a hybrid approach

12 consisting of multiple additional sources of water with far fewer damaging environmental

13 effects. Furthermore, the assumptions that led to the claimed need of 21,500 acre feet per year

14 have proven to overestimate demand and the claimed need is not supported by substantial
evidence.

15

16 106. West Basin also bases its rejections of alternatives on a claim that the a new water

17 source be "drought proof," despite the Project Objectives only requiring that the source improve

18 drought resiliency. Nonetheless, West Basin uses "drought proof' as a means to eliminate

19 feasible alternatives. The term is not defined in the EIR. West Basin failed to adequately

20 analyze whether alternatives meet the Project Objectives of improving drought resiliency.

21 107. Through the overly narrow interpretation of the Project Objectives and the

22 unwarranted inclusion of shadow objectives, West Basin forecloses from the outset any of the

23 many feasible alternatives that could meet its Project Objectives with a much lower
environmental impact.

24

25 108. West Basin failed to adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the

26 Project in the EIR. The conclusion that non-desalination alternatives do not meet the Project
Objectives is not supported by substantial evidence.

27 B.

28 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Land Use Impacts
109. The EIR fails to properly identify the significant land use impacts from the Project.

20

1 110. The Project site is located within El Segundo's designated coastal zone and subject
2 to El Segundo's Local Coastal Program.

3 111. The El Segundo Local Coastal Program is a plan adopted for the purpose of

4 avoiding or mitigating environmental effects in the coastal zone.

5 112. The EIR states that a significant adverse impact would exist if the Project were to

6 "[c]onflict with any applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction

7 over the Project (including but not limited to the General Plan, Specific Plan, LCP [Local
8 Coastal Program], or zoning ordinance adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an

9 environmental effect." (Draft EIR at 5.10-13)

10 113. The Project conflicts with the existing El Segundo Local Coastal Program that

11 designates the Project site to be used only for an electrical generating station with accessory

12 buildings and for on-site modifications to existing facilities.

13 114. The EIR claims that land use impacts would be less than significant because the

14 admitted inconsistency of the Project with the existing Local Coastal Program could be
15 amended out of existence. The EIR lacks any analysis of the potential environmental impacts

16 on the Coastal Zone (including resources held in trust for the People of California) from this

17 major change. However, as both Waterkeeper and the California Coastal Commission (among

18 others) explained, this change in the Local Coastal Program itself has readily foreseeable

19 significant environmental impacts--the construction of the Project represents a major change in
20 land use from that contemplated in the existing Local Coastal Program because the Project does

21 not consist of uses ancillary to existing power generation facilities. Instead, the Project includes

22 construction of an entirely new facility that will drain energy resources from the electrical grid.

23 C. The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Construction Impacts
24 115. The EIR acknowledges that the Project's construction-phase impacts may be

25 significant, but does not adequately mitigate them.

26 116. For example, the EIR identifies the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
27 ("LADWP") Scattergood Generating Station as a possible laydown and parking area location

28 for the Project.

21

1 117. However, LADWP stated unambiguously that it "does not have any space

2 available at the Scattergood Generating Station and requests that this facility be removed from

3 I consideration as an off-site potential construction staging/laydown area."(Final EIR at 14-181.)
4 Incredibly, the Final EIR responds stating "[a]lthough West Basin appreciates the comment,

5 space availability at Scattergood may change in the future; therefore, no change has been made

6 to the EIR." (Final EIR at 14-334).

7 118. As a result, the EIR fails to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's actual

8 potential construction impacts.

9 D. The EIR Does Not Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Energy and Greenhouse
Gas Impacts
10 119. Ocean water desalination is the most energy intensive and climate-impacting
11 means of obtaining potable water. The energy demand of desalinating seawater even surpasses
12 that of importing water from outside of Los Angeles County.
13 120. The energy demand of the Project will equate to adding an additional 18,185
14 households, (about twice the size of nearby Hermosa Beach), to the electrical grid.
15 121. Additionally, the operation of the Project will contribute an estimated 44,702
16 metric tons of greenhouse gases ("GHG") to the atmosphere every year.
17 122. Rather than addressing these impacts, the EIR claims that the Project is net-zero
18 for GHG. To reach this conclusion, the EIR assumes that the volume of imported water in the
19 service area of the Metropolitan Water District will be exactly offset by the volume of
20 desalinated water provided by the new source for the West Basin service area.
21 123. However, there is no evidence or support in the EIR for this claim. In fact, the
22 Metropolitan Water District states in its comment letter that its long-term Integrated Water
23 Resource Plan "includes maintaining the Colorado River Aqueduct supplies and restoring the
24 reliability of the State Water Project . (EIR at 14-184.)
25 124. The EIR failed to use an appropriate baseline to calculate the greenhouse gas
26 emissions from the Project, resulting in an untenable and flawed analysis of the impacts of the
27 Project. The findings in the EIR regarding GHG impacts are not supported by substantial
28 evidence and are legally inadequate as well.

22

E. The EIR Does Not Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Marine Impacts

2 125. The EIR also found impacts to marine resources less than significant, despite
3 lengthy comments from Responsible and Trustee agencies raising concerns and objections with
the EIR's analysis for the proposed open intake desalination Project.

5 126. In part, the EIR reached this conclusion by using an improperly restricted study

6 area consisting of a single 1 by p 1.5 nautical mile strip located immediately offshore from the
7 Project site.

8 127. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the surrounding Mugu

9 Lagoon to Latigo Point Area of Special Biological Significance, State Marine Reserve, Point
10 Vicente State Marine Conservation Area, and Abalone Cove State Marine Conservation Area.

11 128. The EIR does not analyze the cumulative effect of the Project as a whole on a
12 marine life, choosing instead to analyze various impacts of the Project in isolation.
13 129. The EIR also fails to include adequate mitigation measures, relying instead on
14 vague claims of restoring or enhancing marine or coastal habitat.

15 F. The Environmental Justice Analysis is Inadequate.

16 130. The infrastructure for the Project will be located in areas within West Basin's

17 service territory that have the highest CalEnviroScreen scores and disadvantaged community
18 percentages relative to West Basin's territory as a whole.

19 131. The EIR fails to analyze or provide mitigation for the construction impacts on
20 disadvantaged communities claiming they are only "short-term" despite an estimated
21 30-months construction time.

22 132. The EIR does not address the disproportionate impact that these communities may
23 suffer due to the increased greenhouse gas emissions of the Project.
24 133. The EIR does not adequately analyze the air pollution impacts that will occur in
25 disadvantaged communities due to the Project construction and operation and fails to propose
26 appropriate mitigation for those impacts.

27 134. The EIR does not address the environmental justice impacts related to the water

28 rate increase that will accompany West Basin's addition of the most expensive source of water

23

- to its portfolio.

2

3 135. West Basin also fails to analyze the environmental justice impact of the Project in

4 light of the significant discrepancy in the daily per capita amount of water used within its

5 service territory. Many of the disadvantaged communities in West Basin's territories already
use far less water than the affluent

6 ones, with differences in amount of water used per person

7 per day varying by more than 100 gallons (e.g., Hawthorne uses approximately 65 gallons per

8 person per day while Palos Verdes uses more than 170 gallons per person per day). By
approving the Project when there is enormous room for additional conservation by wealthier
9 communities, West Basin is forcing disadvantaged communities within its service territory to

10

11 subsidize the excessive water consumption of wealthier communities. West Basin is placing

12 additional economic (from rate increases) and pollution (from the climate and construction

13 impacts) burdens on the communities least able to bear them. The EIR fails to adequately
analyze these impacts.

14 G.

15 Impacts The EIR Does Not Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Cumulative

16

17 136. CEQA requires analysis of cumulative impacts of Projects. (See Bozung, supra, 13

18 Cal. 3d 263.) The EIR does not analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project, choosing instead
to view impacts in isolation.

19 137. Without accounting for the cumulative impacts of the Project, West Basin's
20| proposed mitigation measures cannot adequately mitigate the harm the Project will cause.

21

22 138. By failing to adequately analyze all of the impacts of the Project and propose

23 adequate mitigation, the EIR fails to properly integrate the CEQA review with the requirements
of the Coastal Act, Porter-Cologne, and the State Lands Commission approval process,
24 substantially diminishing its informational value. This failure to integrate CEQA review with

25

26 other processes also contributes to an inadequate analysis of cumulative impacts.

III.

27 West Basin Did Not Adequately Respond to Comments on the Draft EIR

28 139. On June 25, 2018, Waterkeeper submitted 36 pages of comments alleging
numerous deficiencies in the draft EIR including: that the alternatives analysis was inadequate;

24

F that West Basin did not adequate analyze the impacts that the Project will have on marine life,

2 energy and greenhouse gas emissions, land use, traffic and construction, and environmental
3 justice.

4 140. Additionally, more than 30 organizations with focuses ranging from environmental
5 justice, climate, tribal rights, air quality, and public health expressed significant concerns with

6 the Project related to, among other things, the failure to analyze the cumulative impacts of the
7 Project, the failure to meaningfully consider any alternatives other than a desalination facility,

8 the vagueness and inadequacy of the mitigation measures proposed, the inadequate analysis of
9 marine impacts and mitigation, the failure to appropriate analyze the greenhouse gas and energy
10 impacts of the Project, and the failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the environmental
11 I justice impacts of the Project.

12 141. More than 20 California agencies also submitted comments, many of which
13 overlapped with the concerns expressed by Waterkeeper. Four California Responsible and/or
14 Trustee Agencies (the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, the State Lands
15 Commission, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Coastal Commission) raised
16 serious concerns with the adequacy of West Basin's EIR.
17 142. The City of Los Angeles and several of West Basin's own customer-cities also
18 raised major concerns.

19 143. The final EIR failed to adequately respond to the comments from Waterkeeper, the
20 public, and state and local agencies. West Basin's responses to the agencies were no more
21 adequate than its responses to comments from the public at large.
22 144. The draft EIR, for example, disclosed that West Basin was considering using the
23 parking area of the nearby Scattergood Power Plant owned by LADWP as a staging area for
24 construction of its desalination plant. Construction-phase impacts are the only impacts West
25 Basin acknowledged to be significant in the EIR and construction impacts are the only topic
26 addressed in the Statement of Overriding Considerations included in the approval resolutions.
27 145. The City of Los Angeles commented on the draft EIR and stated unequivocally
28 that it would not allow the use of its Scattergood property by West Basin for construction

25

1 staging. In response, West Basin refused to modify the EIR analysis of construction impacts,

2 justifying its refusal on the grounds that the City of Los Angeles could conceivably change its

3 mind at some future date.

4 146. The State Lands Commission found that West Basin appeared to defer mitigation

5 and analysis related to the marine impacts for non-special status species, and that West Basin

6 should include the analysis of a worst-case scenario regarding mortality studies. West Basin

7 declined to do so.

8 147. The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (*Regional Board")

9 commented that the draft EIR failed to adequately address the factors outlined in the Ocean

10 Plan; failed to provide enough information for the Regional Board to determine whether

11 subsurface intakes are feasible; and that the EIR should evaluate the use of stainless steel
12 wedgewire screens.

13 148. West Basin's responses to the Regional Board failed to engage with the issues

14 raised by this Responsible Agency. For example, the Regional Board requested that West Basin

15 evaluate the use of stainless steel, self-cleaning wedgewire screens that eliminate the risk of

16 leaching copper into the environment and because they are self-cleaning, would minimize

17 greenhouse gas emissions from boat operations needed to manually clean the screens. In

18 response, West Basin stated that it had already evaluated the impact of the copper screens in the

19 Draft EIR and that it "adequately quantified the potential impacts of copper leaching and no
20 water quality impact from the Cu-Ni screen was identified" and "the evaluation of stainless

21 steel wedgewire screens is not required." (EIR at 13-109).

22 149. As for the Regional Board's comments that West Basin failed to comply with the

23 Ocean Plan, West Basin responded stating that "[t]he Draft EIR provides a detailed alternatives

24 analysis as required by CFQA . . ..'" (EIR at 13-108)

25 150. The California Coastal Commission recommended that the draft EIR be revised to

26 evaluate the non-compliance of the Project with the El Segundo Local Coastal Program and that

27 these conflicts be identified as significant impacts. In response, the EIR referred the Coastal
28 Commission back to the text of the draft EIR that precipitated the criticism in the first place,

26

1 and adding only the bare assertion that its analysis was sound. (EIR at 13-60-66.)

2 151. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife commented that with regard to

3 proposed mitigation of the entrainment of fish, invertebrates and other marine mammals, the

4 proposed mitigation measure assessment period should be extended from 12 to 24 months.

5 West Basin refused this Trustee Agency's request, stating only that it would ensure that the

6 California Department of Fish and Wildlife "is consulted." (EIR at 13-92.). CEQA requires

7 more than checking a box on "consultation." West Basin has a duty to find out and disclose all

8 it reasonable can, and it did not provide reasons for rejecting the request made by California

9 Department of Fish Wildlife.

10 152. As to the responses to Waterkeeper's comments, West Basin generally employed

11 circular arguments directing Waterkeeper back to the analysis contained in the Draft EIR-the

12 analysis that prompted Waterkeeper's comments in the first placewithout substantively

13 addressing the critical issues raised.

14 153. Instead of engaging with the valid critiques concerning the EIR, West Basin

15 ignored any criticisms and refused to alter the EIR to comply with CEQA. The above excerpted

16 responses are emblematic of West Basin's refusal to adequately respond to the comments from

17 the public and state agencies regarding flaws in the EIR.

18 IV. West Basin Failed to Address the Transformative Changes That Took Place During

19 Preparation of the Final EIR

20 154. The EIR ignored the transformative changes that took place in the water resources

21 landscape between the release of the draft and final EIRs.

22 155. Los Angeles County residents maintained significant levels of conservation during

23 this time, and California passed legislation mandating conservation for the first time, including

24 Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606.

25 156. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti publicly committed the City to recycling 100%

26 of its wastewater by 2035, including the discharge from the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant

27 that is currently treated and discharged into the Pacific Ocean. This will amount to
28 approximately 230 MGD of recycled water supplies by 2035.

27

1 157. The Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that the State Water Resources Control

2 Board has an enforceable Constitutional duty to consider whether the discharge from Hyperion

3 iS a reasonable and beneficial use of water.

4 158. The Metropolitan Water District, working in conjunction with the Sanitation

5 District of Los Angeles, announced it will soon release a Notice of Preparation for an EIR

6 involving a proposed wastewater recycling facility that will recycle 100 - 150 MGD when

7 complete. A pilot program is now operational.

8 159. The State Water Resources Control Board reiterated that regulations allowing for

9 the direct potable reuse of water will be implemented by 2023, further enhancing the viability

10 of using recycled water from Hyperion, the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant, and other
11 wastewater treatment facilities in the region as a potable water source.

12 160. The voters of Los Angeles County approved the passage of Measure W that will

13 provide approximately $280 million dollars per year to fund stormwater capture and multi-
14 benefit water supply projects.

15 161. The City of Los Angeles announced the shuttering of three natural gas power

16 plants along the coast (Harbor, Haynes, and Scattergood) that employ the same open-ocean

17 intakes West Basin proposes to use for the Project, in favor of developing renewable energy

18 sources.

19 162. Governor Newsom requested the California Public Utilities Commission to
20 investigate a shorter timeline for closing SoCalGas's Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility.

21 163. Projects to clean up the San Fernando Groundwater Basin and remove

22 contaminants from the water supply have begun, opening up a new source of water that will

23 increase the region's drought resilience. Through clean-up efforts, it is estimated that an

24 additional 4,670 acre feet per year may become available for potable use.
25 164. Despite the fact that each of these changes significantly impacts the feasibility of
26 alternatives available to West Basin to meet its Project Objectives, the EIR does not address or
27 analyze any of these significant events.

28 V. Certification and Approval of the Final EIR

28

165. On October 23, 2019, West Basin released the Final EIR for the Project and set a
2 hearing to vote on certification and approval 26 days later, on November 18, 2019.
3 166. Despite the short turnaround on the Final EIR, Waterkeeper submitted comments
4 on November 15, 2019, outlining the continued serious deficiencies in the EIR and objecting to
5 its certification. Of primary concern was the failure of West Basin to meaningfully consider

6 alternatives, adequately analyze and mitigate the impacts of the Project, engage with the many
7 comments submitted regarding the draft EIR by Waterkeeper or other stakeholders, and its

8 failure to adequately integrate CEQA review with other review processes.

9 167. At the hearing, the State Lands Commission and Los Angeles Regional Water
10 Quality Control Board (both of whom are Responsible and Trustee Agencies under CEQA)
11 submitted written comments on the Final EIR and/or spoke outlining the continued serious
12 deficiencies in the EIR.

13 168. Both agencies voiced strong concerns that responses to comments on the draft EIR
14 were inadequate. Both agencies stated their conclusions that the EIR did not allow for their

15 informed consideration of the Project.

16 169. Additionally, at the hearing, numerous members of the public voiced opposition to
17 the Project. Waterkeeper reiterated the deficits in the EIR and that it failed to comply with
18 CEQA.

19 170. In their statements before voting to approve the Project, multiple Board Members
20 expressed contempt for and dismissed the public's, Waterkeeper's, and the state agencies'
21 concerns as "misinformation" rather than attempting to evaluate the sufficiency of the EIR.
22 171. The West Basin Board voted four to one to certify the EIR and approve the
23 Project. West Basin's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project came at the expense
24 of the transparent evaluation of project alternatives; identification of significant impacts; and
25 implementation of mitigation measures required by CEQA.
26 172. On November 20, 2019, West Basin filed a Notice of Determination with the Los

27 Angeles County Clerk.

28 173. This action timely follows.

29

1 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND

2 INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

3 174. Waterkeeper objected to the Project at every stage of the CEQA administrative
4 process and fully exhausted its administrative remedies. Waterkeeper timely objected to
approval of the challenged resolutions at the approval hearing on November 18, 2019.

6 Waterkeeper and/or other objecting or commenting parties raised all of the issues asserted

7 herein.

8 175. Waterkeeper has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

9 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate. In the absence of such remedy, West

10 Basin's approval of the desalination Project would form the basis for a project that would

11 proceed in violation of California law.

12 176. Waterkeeper has complied with Public Resources Code section 261167.7 by filing

13 a copy of this Petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of the cover letter to the

14 Office of the Attorney General is attached as Exhibit A.

15 177. Waterkeeper has complied with Public Resources Code 21167.5 by providing
16 West Basin with notice of its intention to commence this action. A copy of the Proof of Service

17 with the notice letter is included with Exhibit B.

18 178. Waterkeeper elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of the election is
19 attached as Exhibit C.

20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

22 179. Waterkeeper incorporates all of the previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

23 The EIR Does Not Contain Adequate Analysis and Mitigation of Significant
24 Environmental Impacts

25 180. CEQA requires West Basin to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

26 approving projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15004.)

27 181. CEQA imposes clear, present, and mandatory duty upon West Basin to certify an

28 EIR only if the EIR evaluates a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project and fully

30

1 discloses to the public and decision makers the significant environmental effects of the Project
2 and commits to feasible mitigation measures.

3 182. The EIR for the Project does not meet any of those requirements, and thus does not

4 comply with CEQA.

5 183. CEQA further requires that West Basin adopt all feasible mitigation measures to

6 reduce adverse environmental impacts. The Project EIR omits or unjustifiably rejects feasible
7 mitigation measures.

8 A. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Land Use Impacts

9 184. The EIR directly conflicts with El Segundo's Local Coastal Program that was
10 adopted and implemented to ensure the requirements of the Coastal Act are met in development
11 in the coastal zone.

12 185. An EIR is obligated to integrate CEQA review with the requirements of the
13 Coastal Act. (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal. 5th at 919, 939, 942.)

14 186. The El Segundo Local Coastal Program provides that "maximum access to the
15 shore and protection of the beach area" is a high priority and that any shoreline erosion
16 prevention structures "be designed to eliminate or mitigate, to the maximum extent feasible,
17 adverse impacts on adjacent beach areas." The El Segundo Local Coastal Program constitutes
18 regulations adopted for the purpose of avoiding and mitigating construction-related impacts of
19 new development in the coastal zone in El Segundo.

20 187. Despite the stated goals of the El Segundo Local Coastal Program, the EIR

21 wrongly claims that there would be no land use impacts because there were no El Segundo
22 "policies or regulations adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating a construction-related
23 impact."

24 188. The EIR neglects to analyze the fact that the Project violates the El Segundo Local
25 Coastal Program that only permits new developments along the coastal zone in the form of
26 "minor modifications of existing energy facilities, minor public works projects, or possibly
27 construction of shoreline protective structures." The Project does not fall into any of these

28 categories.

31

189. The EIR also fails to address the impact of the construction and operation of the

2 Project given that the EI Segundo Local Coastal Program states that any significant new

3 developments will be precluded by the susceptibility of the shoreline to erosion.

4 190. The EIR fails to address the impacts that may come from any attempt to amend the

5 El Segundo Local Coastal Program to allow for the construction of the Project.

6 191. Despite the patent conflict between the Project and the El Segundo Local Coastal

7 Program, the EIR failed to disclose or analyze these significant impacts or to formulate

8 appropriate mitigation measures.

9 192. The EIR fails to account for the significant construction and operation-related land
10 use impacts that will occur.
11 193. By refusing to consider the impacts of an amendment to the El Segundo Local

12 Coastal Program, the EIR fails to meet its obligations to integrate CEQA with the Coastal Act,

13 and fails to provide the necessary analysis or appropriate mitigation measures.

14 194. Additionally, the Project conflicts with the California Ocean Plan Amendment.

15 The Project will use open ocean intakes in lieu of subsurface intakes, and the analysis in the

16 EIR fails to meet the requirements of the California Ocean Plan Amendment as it lacks the it

17 necessary alternatives analysis. These conflicts are also land use impacts that required

18 disclosure, analysis, and mitigation in the EIR. The EIR did not do so.

19 B. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate the GHG Emissions of
20 the Project

21 195. The operation of the 20 MGD Project will contribute as much as 44,702 metric

22 tons of GHG emissions per year. But, by relying on an incorrect baseline, the EIR concludes

23 that these additional GHG emissions would not trigger the significance threshold.

24 196. The EIR claims that despite these additional greenhouse gas emissions each year,

25 the Project will not have a significant impact because the desalinated water produced by the

26 Project would allegedly displace imported water from the Metropolitan Water District.

27 However, nowhere in the EIR is there any evidence in support of this theory. Indeed, there is
28 contradictory evidence that the Metropolitan Water District will not decrease its purchase of

32

- imported water. In its comment letter, Metropolitan Water District states that its long-term
2 Integrated Water Resource Plan "includes maintaining the Colorado River Aqueduct supplies
3 and restoring the reliability of the State Water Project .. .." (EIR at 14-184.)
4 197. The EIR fails to compare the emissions from the Project to the appropriate

5 baselinethe existing environmental setting that includes the total amount of water being

6 imported.

7 198. By failing to use an appropriate baseline, the EIR vastly underestimates the impact
8 of the Project.

9 199. The Project also conflicts with California's 2017 Scoping Plan and GHG reduction
10 goals, but the EIR fails to acknowledge these conflicts or consider them in its analysis.

11 200. The EIR failed to analyze or disclose the extent to which the construction and
12 operation of the Project will disincentivize water conservation efforts, leading to indirect
13 increases in carbon emissions.

14 201. Along with failing to analyze GHG impacts of the Project, the EIR also fails to
15 adopt adequate mitigation measures.

16 202. By relying on an improper baseline to determine the impact of GHG emissions, the
17 EIR vastly underestimates the impacts and fails to include mitigation measure to address the
18 full scope of the tens of thousands of tons of GHG emissions that will be released yearly if the
19 Project is brought to fruition.

20 C. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Energy Impacts
21 203. Ocean water desalination is the most energy-intensive means of increasing local
22 water supplies.
to desalinate 23 204. The EIR explains that "the Project would consume more energy
24 water than is currently consumed (or would be consumed in the future) by importing water."
25 (Draft EIR at 5.5-19.) The 20 MGD Project will have the electricity demand of 18,185 homes,
26 essentially adding an additional small city to the grid.

27 205. CEQA requires that "EIRs include a discussion of the potential energy impacts of
28 proposed projects, with a particular emphasis on avoiding or reducing inefficient, wasteful and

33

- | unnecessary consumption of energy. (See Pub. Resources Code § 21100(b)(3).)

2 206. The EIR fails to analyze whether, in light of the multiple potentially feasible water

3 supply options available besides ocean water desalination, pursuing the most energy intensive

4 source of water could constitute an inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary consumption of energy.

5 207. The EIR's finding that energy impacts are not significant is not supported by

6 substantial evidence.

7 208. The EIR merely makes the conclusory claim that "the increase [sic] energy

8 requirements needed to enhance the reliability of the District's water supply is not wasteful, but

9 rather it is a responsible water management option for a Southern California coastal water
10 district to consider." (EIR at 16-112.) The EIR makes this claim without even adequately

11 analyzing alternative water supplies that could enhance reliability and otherwise meet basic

12 Project Objectives in a less energy intensive manner.
13 209. The EIR also incorrectly concludes that compliance with federal and/or state
14 energy standards satisfies the requirement to avoid the inefficient, wasteful or unnecessary

15 consumption of energy.

16 210. The EIR acknowledges that energy impacts would be significant if they resulted in

17 "an increase in demand for electricity or natural gas that exceeds available supply or

18 distribution infrastructure capabilities that could result in the construction of new energy

19 facilities or expansion of existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant

20 environmental effects." (EIR at 5.5-10.)

21 211. The EIR admits that "Ti]t is anticipated that the SCE electrical power grid may

22 require upgrades to supply the project operations," but fails to analyze the significant impacts

23 that would result from such upgrades and fails to provide any mitigation to address those

24 impacts.

25 212. The EIR neglects to address the fact that SCE has stated that available generation

26 may not be sufficient to meet peak summer demand within a few years.

27 213. The EIR fails to analyze the diminishment of the use of the SoCalGas Aliso

28 Canyon natural gas storage facility after the 2015 methane leak on energy supply to the grid

34

1 from which the Project would draw power.

2 214. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the effect the closure of three power plants on
3 the coast (Scattergood, Harbor, and Haynes) will have on energy supply to the grid from which
4 the Project would draw power.

5 215. The EIR fails to analyze, either individually or cumulatively, the impact of these
6 changes to energy supplies to the electrical grid and the resulting strain that will be placed on
7 the grid if the Project moves forward. Nonetheless, the EIR improperly determines that there is

8 no significant impact, in direct contradiction to the governing criteria.

9 216. The EIR fails to provide mitigation measures to address the significant energy
10 impacts, and instead defers discussion of mitigation measure to a later date after undefined
11 "subsequent evaluations" have occurred. Deferred mitigation violates CEQA.
12 D. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Marine Life and
13 Water Quality Impacts

14 217. The EIR acknowledges that the Project will suck in more than 40 million gallons

15 per day of ocean water and expel more than 20 million gallons per day of concentrated and

16 toxic brine into Santa Monica Bay.

17 218. The EIR describes the environmental setting of the Project as Santa Monica Bay,

18 but rather than assess the impact of the Project on the Santa Monica Bay as whole, the EIR

19 improperly restricts its review to a single 1 by 1.5 nautical mile strip immediately offshore from

20 the Project site.

21 219. The EIR's use of an unduly small evaluation area ignores the fact that the Project's

22 use of open-ocean intakes that will harm flora and fauna outside of the immediate area of the

23 intake, but the EIR does not analyze or propose mitigation for these harms.

24 220. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the Mugu Lagoon to Latigo

25 Point Area of Special Biological Significance.

26 221. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the Point Dume State

27 Marine Conservation Area.

28 222. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the State Marine Reserve.

35

1 223. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the Point Vicente State

2 Marine Conservation Area.

3 224. The EIR fails to consider the impacts of the Project on the Abalone Cove State

4 Marine Conservation Area.

5 225. The EIR fails to consider the criteria of the California Ocean Plan as an indicator

6 of significance, despite the fact that the Ocean Plan represents the regulatory framework

7 adopted to specifically address the water quality and marine biological effects of ocean

8 desalination projects. The Ocean Plan requires that desalination plants be operated to minimize

9 mortality to all forms of marine life.

10 226. The EIR fails to comply with the Ocean Plan that requires that locations for

11 desalination plants be chosen based upon the feasibility of constructing subsurface intake pipes.

12 227. The EIR explains that the EI Segundo Generating Station was chosen as the project

13 site because it had existing open-ocean intakes already constructed, in direct contravention of

14 the applicable Ocean Plan.

15 228. The EIR improperly determines that the impact of the use of open ocean intakes is

16 not significant, claiming that the Project is simply repurposing the existing open ocean intakes;

17 however, the EIR fails to recognize that those intakes were decommissioned because they

18 created significant environmental impacts.

19 229. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the fact that the open-ocean intakes previously

20 used by the El Segundo Generating Station have since been filled with concrete plugs and will

21 not be available for use with the Project unless construction is undertaken to remove the plugs.

22 The EIR lacks adequate analysis of the impacts of this additional construction on marine life or

23 water quality.

24 230. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the effect of the disturbance of soft-bottom

25 and hard-bottom habitat in the vicinity of the Project on the basis of an unsupported claim that

26 pelagic fish and groundfish would avoid the area.

27 231. The EIR fails to analyze the potential toxicity and impacts on marine life resulting

28 from disturbing sediment on the Santa Monica Bay floor contaminated with toxins including

36

ocean intakes and F DDT to engage in construction activities related to repurposing the open
2 discharge pipes.

3 232. The EIR fails to consider that the use of copper wedgewire screens on the seawater
4 intake pipes may create significant marine life and water quality impacts as this technology is
5 uncertain and has the potential to leach copper into the marine environment.

6 233. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the significant impacts
ocean intakes on marine life and water 7 resulting from the construction of the Project using open

8 quality,

9 E. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Environmental
Justice Impacts
10 234. The EIR fails to consider the air quality effects due to construction impacts on the
11 disadvantaged communities in which the conveyance infrastructure for the Project will be
12 located.
13 235. The proposed infrastructure for the Project will be located in areas within West
14 Basin's territory that have the highest Cal EnviroScreen scores and disadvantaged community
15 percentages relative to West Basin's territory as a whole.
16 236. The EIR summarily concludes that this would not create a disproportionate impact
17 on these communities despite acknowledging that "short-term temporary impacts related to
18 hazardous materials use/transport and construction noise would result from construction of
19 conveyance facilities . . .." (EIR at 18-44).
20 237. The EIR does not analyze the environmental justice impacts related to the
21 Project's GHG and climate change impacts.
22 238. The EIR did not analyze the fact that the disadvantaged communities in West
23 Basin's service territory have already accomplished significantly higher levels of water
24 conservation than the more affluent communities West Basin services. The EIR neglects to
25 address the fact that pursuing the most expensive source of water, instead of increasing
26 conservation, will increase water rates for all of its customers and force its most price-conscious
27 customers to subsidize the excessive water use of more affluent customers. The EIR does not
28 analyze the environmental justice impacts related to the Project's water rate increases.

37

239. Without evidence, the EIR improperly concludes that air quality pollutant criteria

2 are considered on a regional scale and thus would not significantly impact those living in the

3 disadvantaged communities where the infrastructure would be located. The EIR does not

4 analyze or provide adequate mitigation for the short-term impacts of construction on

5 disadvantaged communities.

6 F. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Traffic Impacts

7 240. The EIR identifies the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ("LADWP")

8 Scattergood Generating Station as a possible laydown and parking area location for the Project.

9 241. However, the EIR failed to consider the comment by LADWP stating that, "The

10 LADWP does not have any space available at the Scattergood Generating Station and requests

11 that this facility be removed from consideration as an off-site potential construction

12 staging/laydown area." (EIR at 14-181.) Instead, the EIR states that these identifications were

13 preliminary, and "[a]lthough West Basin appreciates the comment, space availability at

14 Scattergood may change in the future; therefore, no change has been made to the EIR." (EIR at

15 14-334). Thus, the Project's traffic impacts from construction have not been adequately

16 disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated.

17 G. The EIR Improperly Deferred Mitigation

18 242. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be disclosed in an EIR so that their

19 efficacy and any potential environmental impacts of those mitigation measures can be
20 evaluated.

21 243. Mitigation measures must be concrete and enforceable.

22 244. The EIR claims that it will prepare an Energy Minimization and GHG Reduction

23 Plan at least 60 days prior to the start of construction. However, it does not identify or lay out

24 any concrete or enforceable ways through which it will reduce GHG emissions. This is deferred

25 mitigation that violates CEQA.

26 245. In other areas, the EIR fails to disclose the Project's likely environmental impacts,

27 resulting in a failure to disclose and evaluate necessary mitigation measures.

28 246. Many of Project's mitigation measures are deferred, vague, or otherwise

38

F unenforceable.

2 II. The EIR Does Not Evaluate a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

3 247. Four Responsible and Trustee Agencies commented on germane issues within

4 their jurisdiction and requested specific analysis and information be disclosed in the EIR,

5 including evaluating a wider (and not unduly narrow) range of reasonable alternatives and

6 information necessary to evaluate compliance with the Ocean Plan. However, West Basin

7 unjustifiably refused to include such information in the EIR and failed to fulfil its obligations to
8 integrate CEQA review with the permitting and oversight review conducted by Responsible and

9 Trustee Agencies. Accordingly, the EIR alternatives analysis is legally inadequate as a matter

10 of law.

11 A. The EIR Only Evaluates Variations on an Outdated Desalination Facility Design

12 248. CEQA requires that the EIR explore alternatives to the proposed project that "are

13 capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these

14 alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives or would be
more costly. (Guidelines, § 15126.6(b).) An EIR must consider a reasonable range of 15 alternatives. Despite this duty, the EIR rejects feasible alternatives and fails to consider
16 potentially feasible alternatives in detail.
17 249. Apart from the "no-build" alternative, the EIR fully evaluates only three
18 alternatives, all of which are open-ocean intake desalination plants. Two of those alternatives
19 are located on adjacent sites in El Segundo within the boundaries of the former El Segundo
20 | Generating Station. The range of alternatives evaluated is improperly narrow, rendering the EIR
21 inadequate.
22 250. Moreover, the alternatives ignore the requirements of the Ocean Plan. The Ocean
23 Plan requires evaluation of alternative locations where subsurface intakes would likely be
24 feasible. The EIR only evaluates feasibility of subsurface intakes at West Basin's preferred site
25 (chosen based on the existence of open-ocean intakes there), and concludes that subsurface
26 intakes are not feasible at that location. This alternatives analysis does not comply with the
27 Ocean Plan, as Waterkeeper, the Coastal Commission, the Sierra Club, and others commented.
28 The response to these substantive comments was a conclusory statement that the EIR

39

1 alternatives analysis complied with CEQA.

2 B. The EIR Rejects Reasonable Alternatives Using an Unduly Narrow
3 Interpretation of the Project Objectives

4 251. The Project Description (including the Project Objectives) is intended to assist the

5 lead agency in developing a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate in the EIR.

6 252. Rather than using the Project Objectives to meaningfully consider alternatives, the

7 EIR interprets each of the objectives impermissibly narrowly and rejects alternatives out of

8 hand, leaving an EIR that considered only two variations on a desalination plant with open-

9 ocean intakes, in addition to the no-build alternative. Relatedly, the EIR failed to accurately

10 identify numerous significant impacts of the approved Project.

11 253. One Project Objective is to improve security through local control and
12 infrastructure; however, the EIR fails to analyze or explain why local control can only be

13 achieved through a project exclusively controlled by West Basin, as opposed to contractual

14 agreements or the renegotiation of water rights.

15 254. Another Project Objective is to improve West Basin's local control of future water

16 costs and long-term price stability. However, West Basin rejects out of hand any means of

17 meeting this Project Objective except for construction of a desalination facility without

18 analyzing alternatives.

19 255. A third Project Objective also is to improve climate resiliency by developing a

20 water source less susceptible to hydrologic variability, and develop a potable water supply that

21 is economically viable and environmentally responsible. However, the EIR fails to analyze or

22 address the fact that a desalination facility contributing more than 44,000 metric tons of GHG

23 per year does not meet this Project Objective.

24 256. The EIR failed to evaluate project alternatives that would substantially lessen the

25 significant environmental impacts of the Project, including conservation, stormwater capture,

26 recycling, and brackish desalination, even though they could be combined to meet West Basin's

27 claimed, but unsubstantiated, need.

28 257. The EIR's reliance on unenumerated shadow objectives renders the EIR's

40

F alternatives analysis unsound.

2 258. Further, the EIR improperly concluded that it could not expand its recycling
3 capacity beyond 54 MGD because of a limitation on water from the Hyperion Treatment Plant;
4 but the EIR failed to analyze whether this remains true in light of the commitment by the City
5 of Los Angeles to recycle all water coming from Hyperion (230 MGD on average and 450
6 MGD at peak capacity) by 2035.

7 259. The EIR failed to analyze other potential sources of water that could supply the
8 recycling facility and render the Project unnecessary, thereby entirely avoiding the significant

9 impacts Project.

10 260. The EIR rejected expanding indirect potable reuse of water on the basis that it

11 would not completely offset the need for imported water, despite the fact that the Project also
12 will not completely offset the need for imported water. The Project would only reduce West
13 Basin use of imported water by maximum of 10%, assuming a perfect correlation in offsets
14 between use of current imported water and use of desalinated water.

15 261. The EIR rejected stormwater capture as an alternative or part of a hybrid
16 alternative because it did not have the necessary groundwater rights, but the EIR failed to
17 analyze options to acquire the necessary rights.
18 262. The EIR rejected Direct Potable Reuse projects on the basis that current
19 regulations do not permit Direct Potable Reuse. However, the EIR failed to analyze whether the
20 mandate that Direct Potable Reuse regulations be issued by 2023, long before the completion of
21 the Project, would make Direct Potable Reuse alternatives feasible.

22 263. The EIR rejected all alternatives except ocean desalination claiming failure to meet
23 Project Objectives, despite the fact that the Project itself does not meet the Project Objectives of
24 promoting climate resiliency and finding an economically viable and environmentally
25 responsible source of water.

26 264. One of the significant impacts from the Project is the harm to marine life and water
27 quality that will result. However, the EIR rejected all alternatives that would utilize subsurface

28 intakes to minimize harm to marine life.

41

1 265. The EIR failed to evaluate alternative locations where subsurface intakes would be

2 feasible, as required by the Ocean Plan.

3 266. Under CEQA, "the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating

4 that notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the

5 proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures."

6 (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 105, 134.) West

7 Basin did not meet this burden.

8 267. The Project cannot be approved when there are alternatives to the project that will

9 reduce its significant impacts and are feasible. The EIR lacks any analysis that the alternatives

10 identified in comments; or a hybrid approach combining those alternatives would not be

11 feasible.

12 268. West Basin's unreasonable rejection of and its refusal to consider feasible

13 alternatives renders the EIR inadequate, as does its use of undisclosed shadow objectives.

14 III. The EIR Does Not Include Adequate Responses to Comments

15 269. Under CEQA, the lead agency must provide written responses to comments
16 submitted during the EIR comment period. (Public Resources Code § 21092.5.) Responses

17 require good faith, reasoned analysis. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c).)

18 270. Objections to the lead agency's position must be "addressed in detail giving

19 reasons why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted." (CEQA Guidelines

20 § 15088(c).)

21 271. Instead of providing good faith responses as required by CEQA, the responses to

22 comments here were non-responsive and often directed the commenter back to the original draft

23 EIR language that prompted the comment in the first place.

24 272. In response to Waterkeeper's detailed comments that the Draft EIR utilized the

25 wrong baseline to evaluate marine impacts, the EIR responded stating "The Draft EIR uses the

26 appropriate baseline to evaluate the potential impacts of the Project on marine biological

27 resources. See Master Response: Marine Biological Resources Study Area.' (EIR at 16-117.)

28 The Master Response is also conclusory and lacks support of substantial evidence.

42

1 273. In response to Waterkeeper's comment that the Project will disincentivize
2 conservation, West Basin responded that "[w]ith desalinated water having a relatively high cost
3 and GHG footprint, there should be additional incentive for conservation, not less." (EIR at 16-

4 114). There is a severe disparity in water usage in West Basin's service area with disadvantaged

5 communities using approximately 100 gallons per person per day less than the more affluent

6 areas. West Basin is aware of that the cost of desalinated water will increase water rates for all

7 of its customers, essentially requiring those in disadvantaged communities to subsidize the
8 excessive water use of those in affluent ones.

9 274. In response to LADWP's comment that "[t]he LADWP does not have any space
10 available at the Scattergood Generating Station and requests that this facility be removed from

11 consideration as an off-site potential construction staging/laydown area" (EIR at 14-181), West
12 Basin responded that"[a]lthough West Basin appreciates the comment, space availability at
13 Scattergood may change in the future; therefore, no change has been made to the EIR." (EIR at
14 14-334).

15 275. In response to the State Lands Commission's recommendation that the EIR

16 employ a worst-case scenario mitigation measure, West Basin declined to analyze such a
17 scenario in the EIR without justifying the omission.

18 276. In response to the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board's request
19 that the EIR should analyze the use of stainless steel self-cleaning wedgewire screens for the
20 intakes, the EIR lacked this information. The EIR did not even acknowledge the Regional
21 Board's request that it analyze the use of self-cleaning screens. (EIR at 13-111.)
22 277. Despite receiving hundreds of comments, many of them pointing out flaws in the
23 analysis and suggesting alternatives for consideration and mitigation for the environmental
24 impacts of the Project, the Final EIR only included limited and generally superficial
25 modifications.

26 IV. West Basin Failed to Use Its Independent Judgment in Approving the Project
27 278. Prior to approving a project, the lead agency shall certify that "[t]he final EIR
28 reflects the lead agency's independent judgment and analysis." (CEQA Guidelines

43

§ 15090(a)(3).)

2 279. A lead agency "must use its independent judgment to consider the impacts of the

3 proposed project on the environment and on the public weal .. Although the decision of the

4 [lead agency] affects the project proponent, the preparation of the EIR may not be prepared

5 with that concern in mind." (Mission Oaks v. County of Santa Barbara (1998) 65 Cal. App. 4th

6 713, 725.)

7 280. Here, however, West Basin has repeatedly and frequently has publicly shown its

8 desire to construct and operate a desalination plant, even preparing a "Program Master Plan" in

9 2013 whose purpose was to facilitate the addition of a desalination plant to the water supply

10 portfolio.

11 V. West Basin Failed to Recirculate the EIR in Light of Deficiencies in the Draft EIR
12 and Significant New Information Between the Close of Comments on the Draft EIR
and Release of the Final EIR
13

14 281. CEQA requires an EIR to be recirculated when significant new information
becomes available before certification and/or when the Draft EIR requires substantial revisions
15 to make the document adequate.
16 282. Significant new information became available prior to the close of the
17 administrative process that was not included in the EIR. These developments warranted a
18 I recirculation of the EIR.
19 283. In November 2018, the County of Los Angeles passed Measure W. Beginning in
20

21 January 2020, Measure W will provide approximately $280 million dollars per year to construct l
and operate storm water capture projects. This funding will substantially increase the amount of
22

23 storm water that is captured and available for reuse.

24 284. In February 2019, the mayor of Los Angeles announced that all of the wastewater

25 from the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant, approximately 230 million gallons per day on

26 average, will be recycled by 2035, providing a significant source of water that West Basin may
be able to access to expand its water recycling operations.
27 285. In 2019, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that three coastal power
28

44

plants (Scattergood, Harbor, and Haynes) would not be repowered, but would be phased out
2 and retired by 2029, in favor of renewable energy. However, this may place the power grid
3 from which the Project would draw under additional stress as LADWP works to replace the lost

4 energy generation capacity.

5 286. After the circulation of the draft EIR, the existing ocean intakes that West Basin
6 planned to use as intakes for the Project were blocked with concrete plugs by the owner of the
7 former power plant. The removal of these plugs may create significant impacts that are not
8 adequately addressed in the EIR.

9 287. CEQA requires the EIR to explore alternatives to a proposed project that "are
10 capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these
11 alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives or would be
12 more costly." (Guidelines, § 15126.6(b).)
13 288. This new information undermines the analysis of the environmental impacts and
14 feasible alternatives in the EIR and presents newly identified significant environmental impacts
15 and an increase in the severity of those already identified that required disclosure, analysis and
16 mitigation in the EIR before the Project could be lawfully approved.
17 VI. The Project's Findings are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence
18 289. CEQA permits a project with significant adverse environmental impacts to be
19 approved if the lead agency makes findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the
20 project's benefits will outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation
21 measures or less damaging alternatives available.
22 290. The Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on greenhouse gas
23 emissions, energy use, water quality, marine life, land use, and environmental justice.
24 291. West Basin rejected feasible alternatives, including alternatives that would meet
25 the essential Project Objectives and reduce its significant adverse impacts. Thus, these findings
26 are not supported by substantial evidence.
27 292. The Statement of Overriding Considerations lacks substantial evidence in violation
28 of CEQA. Moreover, it fails to include impacts that were wrongly deemed less than significant

45

- in the EIR.

2 VII. The EIR Does Not Integrate CEQA Requirements with Other Environmental
Review Processes, Which Substantially Impairs the Informational Value of the EIR

4 293. West Basin did not integrate the requirements of CEQA review with the

5 requirements of other environmental permitting processes, and the informational value of the

6 EIR is substantially reduced as result. The California Coastal Commission, State Lands
7 Commission, Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, and California Department

8 of Fish and Wildlife all submitted detailed comments with specific requests for analysis to be

9 included in the EIR.

10 294. For example, the Ocean Plan requires analysis of siting alternatives that would
11 support subsurface intakes. The Coastal Commission and the Regional Board both requested

12 the EIR include this analysis, as it is essential for Responsible Agencies to have such

13 information in determining whether the Project complies with the Ocean Plan.

14 295. Instead, West Basin selected its alternatives on the basis of proximity to existing

15 surface intakes, and did not include analysis of sites where subsurface intakes would likely be

16 feasible, despite the unambiguous requests of the Responsible Agencies.

17 296. The Regional Board commented that because of this omission, the EIR "does not

18 adequately address the Ocean Plan's requirement to evaluate a reasonable range of nearby

19 sites West Basin's refusal to evaluate the siting alternatives required by the Ocean Plan is
20| "untenable." (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal. 5th at 936.)

21 297. The Regional Board also requested analysis of a specific type of intake screen to

22 mitigate water quality impacts, which West Basin did not evaluate in the EIR.
23 298. The Regional Board also provided testimony at the approval hearing that the EIR

24 did not adequately address most of its numerous other concerns with the project.

25 299. The State Lands Commission commented that the EIR did not allow for it to make

26 an informed decision on environmental impacts in the areas within its permitting

27 responsibilities a that include responsibilities as a trustee of Public Trust resources.

28 300. West Basin also failed to evaluate the readily foreseeable impacts of the

46

amendment to the Local Coastal Program that the Project would require, on the grounds that the

2 required amendment would be written to remove the inconsistency of the Project with the Local
Coastal Program, so there would be no impacts to land use. This glaring omission renders the
EIR's discussion of land use impacts and cumulative impacts inadequate. It also substantially
reduces the informational value of the EIR as a whole. West Basin's circular reasoning does not

6 justify its failure to evaluate these impacts, and it is not entitled "to ignore the fact that [its
7 Project] is in the Coastal Zone." (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal. 5th at 936.)

8 301. The Responsible and trustee agencies also made other specific informational

9 requests, which the EIR did not adequately integrate into the analysis, and often ignored
10 entirely.

11 302. West Basin violated its duty to disclose information pertinent to other permitting
12 processes. The omitted information was essential to understand the impacts of the Project under
13 CEQA.

14

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC TRUST)
17 303. Waterkeeper incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
18 304. West Basin is a public agency and approved a project that will require use of
19 Public Trust resources for non-trust uses. West Basin thus has an affirmative, mandatory duty to
20 consider impacts to Public Trust resources before it approves the Project.
21 305. As the Project cannot proceed without an approval by State Lands Commission for
22 use of Public Trust resources, West Basin will be subject to the duty to prevent subjugation of
23 state interests in Public Trust resources. This duty applies to the grantees of rights to use Public
24 Trust resources. This duty is in addition to the other duties imposed upon West Basin by the
25 Public Trust.

26 306. West Basin did not specifically evaluate impacts to Public Trust resources, at most
27 it included "information scattered here and there" in disparate sections of the EIR. This is
28 insufficient. West Basin was obligated to include an integrated, good-faith and reasoned

47

- analysis of impacts to, and consideration of, Public Trust resources in the EIR to aid
2| understanding by the public and decision makers. The State Lands Commission, which

3

4 administers the Public Trust for the People of California, specifically commented that the EIR

5 did not include sufficient analysis to allow it to execute its duties as a Responsible and Trustee
Agency.

6

7 307. West Basin breached its affirmative duties under the California Public Trust, as

8 developed in case law and codified in Public Resources Code section 6009.

9 308. West Basin breached its duty to affirmatively consider how it would prevent

10 subjugation of Public Trust resources under Public Resources Code Section 6009.

11 309. West Basin did not include any analysis specific to impacts on Public Trust

12 resources in the EIR, at best including information "scattered here or there."

13 310. Scattered information is no substitute for reasoned, integrated analysis.

14 311. West Basin did not include any findings in the EIR related to impacts on Public

Trust resources.

15

16 312. West Basin failed to create a record sufficient for a reviewing court or Responsible

17 Agency to evaluate the merits of claims brought under the Public trust.

18 313. West Basin improperly failed to find impacts to Public Trust resources significant.

19 314. Despite repeated objections and concerns from California Responsible and Trustee

20 Agencies, Waterkeeper, and others, the EIR did not include an analysis of alternatives or

21 mitigation that could substantially lessen or avoid impacts to Public Trust resources including
Santa Monica Bay.

22

23 315. West Basin failed to integrate the Public Trust analysis with the CEQA analysis in
the EIR.

24

25 316. West Basin failed to disclose how it affirmatively took the Public Trust into it

26 account in developing the project and evaluating alternatives, impacts, and mitigation measures.
//

27 //

28 //

48

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

2 In each of the

3 respects enumerated above, West Basin has violated its duties under law,

4 failed to execute a non-discretionary duty, abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner

5 required by law, decided the matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence,

6 and failed to include required findings. Accordingly, the certification of the EIR and the
approval of the Project must be set aside.

7 WHEREFORE, Waterkeeper prays for relief as follows:

8

9 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding West Basin:

10 a. to set aside and vacate the certification of the EIR and Resolution 11-19-1105;

11 b. to set aside and vacate the approval for the Project and Resolution 11-19-1106,

12 (including setting aside and vacating the Findings of Fact, and Statement of

13 Overriding Considerations supporting the approval Resolution);

C.

14 for an order enjoining West Basin from taking any action to construct any portion

15 of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way that could result in

16 a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful a

17 approval is obtained after the preparation and consideration of an adequate EIR

18 and adoption of all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures;

19 2. For a writ of mandate commanding West Basin to comply with its non-discretionary

20 duty to consider the California Public Trust before approving the Project;
3. For costs of the suit;

21

22 4. For reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5
and other applicable laws; and

23

24 5. For any such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act to
the approval of the Ocean Water Desalination Project

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge
the approvals of Resolution 11-19-1105 and Resolution 11-19-1106 by the Board of West Basin Municipal Water District on November 18, 2019. Resolution 11-19-1105 certifies the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed Ocean Water Desalination Project, which Los Angeles Waterkeeper believes is inadequate to satisfy the mandates of
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Resolution 11-19-1106 approves the North Site Local Project identified as the District's preferred alternative; authorizes staff to undertake additional evaluation of the North Site Local Project; and adopts Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, also in violation of CEQA.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge
the approvals of Resolution 11-19-1105 and Resolution 11-19-1106 by the Board of West Basin Municipal Water District on November 18, 2019. Resolution 11-19-1105 certifies
the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed Ocean Water Desalination Project, which Los Angeles Waterkeeper believes is inadequate to satisfy the mandates of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Resolution 11-19-1106 approves the North Site Local Project identified as the District's preferred alternative; authorizes staff to undertake additional evaluation of the North Site Local Project; and adopts Findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting a Program, also in violation of CEQA.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

auT
