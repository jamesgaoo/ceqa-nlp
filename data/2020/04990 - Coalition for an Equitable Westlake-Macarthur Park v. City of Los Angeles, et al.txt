VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, alleges:

3 Introduction

4 1. By this action, Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park

5 challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles, its Planning

6

7 Commission, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) in approving a Vesting
Zone change from C2-1 and R4-1 to (T)(Q)RAS4-1, and associated land-use

8 entitlements, as well as the Mitigated Negative Declaration

9 for a project located
at 1000 S. Vermont Avenue (the Project) in Los Angeles, California. On

10 December 4, 2019, the City approved the Project's requested land-use

11 SODEUC-SSOEOTI entitlements and Mitigated Negative Declaration which allows for the
demolition of an existing gas station, 32 apartment units and 8,942 square feet of
medical office space and permit the use, construction and maintenance of a
seven-story mixed use building with 228 residential units and 53,498 square feet
of commercial uses (which includes 565 vehicular parking spaces with two levels
of subterrancan, at-grade and mezzanine level parking, and 310 bicycle parking
spaces) for property located at 1000 South Vermont Avenue (Project Site).

2. The 32 apartment units that would be demolished to make way for the Project all
fall under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance
(RSO), and are occupied by long-term, low-income, mostly Latino families.
Many of the Latino families residing at 1025 Menlo, one of RSO protected
buildings that would be demolished, have lived there longer than fifteen years.
The Project would replace those 32 RSO protected units with 228 units, with

25 only 5% of the rental units being set aside for moderate income families •

26 meaning that only 11 of the market rate units would be set aside for families

27 making 120% of the average median income (example: a family of four making

28 $125,300 a year). Even these moderate income units would be unaffordable for

29 the low-income families living in the area.

30 3.

31 Although the Project will directly displace 32 low-income families in order to

32 replace them with substantially higher income renters. The Mitigated Negative

33 Declaration fails to evaluate the cumulative impact of permanently removing the

34 RSO protected units from the market and the low-income renters that occupy
them; fails to take into account the rent-stabilized housing stock in the area; fails

35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

to evaluate whether, and to what extent, traffic, air quality and carbon footprint

2 are impacted due to the displacement of low-income renters (that rely on local

3 mass transit use) to further away communities and longer commutes to work;

4 whether and to what extent project-related traffic, air quality and carbon footprint

5 are impacted by the influx of affluent renters this project (since they don't

6 typically use mass transit).

7 4. The significant environmental impacts listed in the previous paragraph were not
8 evaluated and will not be mitigated into insignificance by the mitigation
9 measures listed in the Mitigated Negative Declaration. CEQA therefore requires
10 the City to prepare an Environmental Impact Report for the Project. 11
12 Parties
13 5. Petitioner Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park (the Coalition) is
14 an unincorporated association whose members include individuals residing and
15 working in the vicinity of the Project. The Coalition brings this action on behalf
16 of the public. Members of the Coalition have a beneficial interest in this case
17 because the actions being taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect
18 them directly as neighbors of the Project and members of the public at large.
19
20 6. Respondent City of Los Angeles (City) is a municipal corporation. The Los
G8 Angeles City Council (City Council) is the City's legislative body. The Los
Angeles Planning Commission (Planning Commission) is a unit of City
23 government having jurisdiction over certain land-use approvals within the City.
24 7. Real Party in Interest OV, LLC is, on information and belief, the legal and
25 equitable owner of the Project Site and the Applicant for the entitlements being
26 challenged in this case (Applicant).
27
28 8. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents
29 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such
30 fictitious names. Does through 10 are agents of the Respondent and Real Party
31 in Interest who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this
32 petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in

33 the subject matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the

34

2 true names and capacities of Does through 10 when such names and capacities
become known.

4 Jurisdiction and Venue

5 9.

6 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code of

7 Civil Procedure (CCP) §§1085 and 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code § 21167 and Gov.
Code § 65009.

8
9 10. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within

10 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as

UN9:CSSAUSE limited civil cases in CCP §§ 86, 86.1 or 87.
11. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP § 394 because the Respondent City of
Los Angeles a is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County,
which is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.

12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, including exhaustion of all administrative remedies available to them. Petitioner
and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies
asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's decision-
making process.

13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to

24 set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the

25 absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in
violation of the state law and injurious to Petitioner.

26
27 The Project

28 14. The Project at issue in this case is the proposed construction of a seven-story

29
30 mixed use building with 228 residential units (either condominiums or residential

31 units) and 53,498 square feet of commercial uses (which includes 565 vehicular
parking spaces with two levels of subterranean, at-grade and mezzanine level

32 parking, and 310 bicycle parking spaces) for property located at 1000 South

33
34 Vermont Avenue (Project Site). The Project Site sits on a gross lot area of 94,460
square feet (2.16 acres) located at the southeast corner of Vermont Avenue and

35 Olympic Blvd. The Project would entail the demolition of an existing gas station,

N
co 32 apartment units and 8,942 square feet of medical office space. The 32
apartment units are currently occupied by mostly low-income, Latino families
that have lived there for more than ten

00NOu years. The 32 apartment units are
protected by the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance.

15. The Applicant sought, and the City has approved, the following discretionary
entitlements (the Project Entitlements) in Case No. CPC-2016-3180-VZC-
MCUP-SPR-IA:

10 a.

00286.SSOESTE 11 A Vesting Zone Change from C2-1 and R4-1 to (T)(Q)RAS4-1;
b. A Master Conditional Use to permit the sale and dispensing of a full line
of alcoholic beverages for off-site and on-site consumption; and,
c. A Site Plan Review for a development which creates, or results in an
increase of 50 or more residential units or over 50,000 square feet of
commercial area and,

16. In connection with the Project, in Environmental Case No. ENV-2016-3181-
MND the City has adopted an Initial Study (IS), a Mitigated Negative
Declaration (MND), and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
(MMRP) for the Project, under the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub.
Res. Code. §§ 21000-21189.3 (collectively, the CEQA Approvals).

24 Approval Process

25 17. On June 24, 2019, the Planning Commission approved the Project Entitlements,

26 adopted the CEQA Approvals, and recommended that the City Council approve,
the requested Vesting Zone Change.

27
28
29 18. On July 15, 2019 the Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park

30 appealed the Planning Commission's approvals to the City Council's Planning
and Land Use Committee.

31
32 19. On September 24, 2019 the City Council® Planning and Land Use Committee

33 denied the appeal, approved the Project Entitlements, and adopted the CEQA
Approvals.

2 related Project Entitlements, and Adopted the CEQA approvals in Case No.
00 71n CPC-2016-3180-VZC-MCUP-SPR, and ENV-2016-3181-MND.

21. On December 12, 2019, the Notice of Determination for the Project was filed and
posted with the Los Angeles County Clerk.

7 First Cause of Action

8 Violation of CEQA

9 22. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-21 as
10 though set forth here.
11
12 23. In approving the MND, the City violated the California Environmental Quality

13 Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA

14 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000-15387 plus appendices) in significant

15 ways, which are described in the following paragraphs.

16 24. The City of Los Angeles has failed to prepare a legally adequate Initial Study and
17 Mitigated Negative Declaration because those documents fail to even consider
18 impacts related to land use/planning.
19

20 25. The City has also failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's

21 significant Population and Housing, Air Quality, Cultural Resources, Tribal

22 Cultural Resources, Greenhouse Gases, Hydrology and Water Quality, Noise

23 impacts.

24 26. Where mitigation measures are included, they are vague, deferred, or inadequate
25 to truly mitigate the Project's impacts. An EIR is required before the Project may
26 be lawfully approved.
27
28 Population and Housing

29 27. The Project will permanently eliminate 32 apartment units protected by the Los
30 Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) and will replace them with market
31 rate residential units 228 market-rate residential units. Out of those 228

32 residential units, only 11 will be set aside for families making moderate income
33 meaning 120% of the Area Median Income, meaning, for example, that a family
34 of four would have to have an income between $73,100 to $87,700 in order to

CNLECMSSUEUNEEOOJOUAUN 11 qualify. As the city councilmember for the area stated during the September 24,
2019 Planning and Land Use Committee meeting, the Area Median Income for
that neighborhood surrounding the Project Site is substantially lower than that,
and recognized the Project could have the effect of changing the composition of
the low-income neighborhood.
28. The City failed to analyze the following: the cumulative impact of permanently
removing the RSO protected units from the market and permanently displacing
the low-income renters that occupy them; the rent-stabilized housing stock in the
area; whether, and to what extent, traffic, air quality and carbon footprint are
impacted due to the displacement of low-income renters (that rely on local mass
transit use) to further away communities and longer commutes to work; whether
and to what extent project-related traffic, air quality and carbon footprint are
impacted by the influx of affluent renters this project (since they don't typically
use mass transit).

Air Quality
29. The MND (pp. B-13-B-14) says SCAQMD provides that if an individual
development project generates less than significant emissions, then it won't
generate a cumulatively considerable increase in emissions for nonattainment
pollutants. That would mean that no project with individually less than
significant emissions could ever contribute to a cumulatively considerable net

24 increase, calling the MND's analysis into question.

25 30. The analysis of impacts on sensitive receptors of construction-related emissions

26 concludes that localized air quality impacts from construction activities on off-

27 site sensitive receptors would be less than significant. (MND p. B-15). But the

28 MND lacks substantial evidence to support that conclusion, it because it does not

29 present the peak daily emissions or the applicable LSTs. On p. B-15, the MND

30 states that Table 4 shows the peak daily emissions would not exceed the

31 applicable LSTs, but Table B-4 on p. B-16 does not show that. It only lists
sensitive receptors.

Cultural Resources

2
3 31. The MND (p. B-21) says that it's unlikely any archeological resources will be

4 found, but if they are found during excavation, there won't be a significant

5 impact because the project will be required to follow procedures in Public

6 Resources Code § 21083.2. This essentially says treats § 21083.2 like mitigation

7 that would reduce the impact to less than significant. But that section doesn't

8 provide for appropriate mitigation, because it doesn't provide for protection of

9 archeological resources at the time they are discovered. Instead, it provides for

10 establishment of specific mitigation measures and other protections at the time of

11 the environmental review or before permits are issued.
MNLD%SSTEOT 32. Similar to the analysis for archeological resources, the MND (p. B-22) says that
if paleontological resources are found during excavation, the impact would be
less than significant because the project will be required to follow procedures
detailed in Public Resources Code §§ 5097.5 and 30244. Section 5097.5
prohibits knowing and willful excavation, removal, or other harm to
archeological or paleontological sites, but does not provide for protection of
resources upon discovery. Section 30244 provides that reasonable mitigation
shall be required when development would adversely impact archeological or
paleontological resources, but does not set forth what that mitigation would
entail, and does not provide for protection of resources upon discovery. For that
reason, it's inappropriate for the MND to treat §§ 5097.5 and 30244 like

24 mitigation that would reduce impacts to less than significant.

25 Tribal Cultural Resources

26
27 33. Similar to the analysis for archeological resources, the MND (p. B-70) says it's

28 unlikely that the project will significantly impact tribal cultural resources, but

29 that if archeological resources are found, the project will be required to follow

30 procedures detailed in Public Resources Code section 21083.2, so impacts will be

31 less than significant. But section 21083.2 does not provide for procedures to

32 protect tribal cultural resources at the time of discovery and is not an appropriate

33 substitute for mitigation measures formulated during the environmental review
process.

1 Greenhouse Gases

2
3 34. The MND (p. B-28) compares the estimated emissions to SCAQMD's threshold

4 of 3,000 MTC02e "for all land use projects" without any justification for using
that threshold in this circumstance.

5

6 Noise

7
8 35. The analysis of construction-related noise concludes that impacts would be less
than significant because noise would be reduced to the maximum extent

9
10 technically feasible, explaining that the City Noise Ordinance (LAMC section

SNESOSSTES = ~ 112.05) exempts construction noise levels from the 75 dBA noise threshold if all
technically feasible noise attenuation measures are implemented (MND p. B-51).
The fact that the Noise Ordinance exempts greater levels from its threshold when
those levels cannot be reduced does not mean that greater noise levels will not
have a significant impact or relieve the agency from the obligation to mitigate a
significant impact. Table B-9 (p. B-49) shows that noise levels during most
identified construction phases will exceed 75 dBA at distances of 100 feet from
the noise source, and Figure B-4 (p. B-50) identifies residential uses within close
proximity of the project site, including on the west side of Menlo Avenue and the
east side of Vermont Avenue. This supports a fair argument that residential uses
will be exposed to noise above the 75 dBA noise threshold, a potentially
significant impact. Mitigation Measure Noise-1 (p. of the Mitigation
Monitoring Program) does not adequately address this impact, including because

24 it allows noise to exceed significant levels if it is technically infeasible to reduce
such noise.

25
26 36. Also, the analysis does not discuss whether construction activities lasting more

27 than one day would increase the ambient noise levels by 10 dBA or more at any

28 off-site noise-sensitive location or whether construction activities lasting more

29 than 10 days in a three-month period would increase ambient exterior noise

30 levels by 5 dBA or more at a noise sensitive use, although the MND identifies

31 those as significance criteria (p. B-47), and the information in Tables B-8, B-9,

32 and B-10 suggests that those thresholds would be exceeded, also supporting a fair

33 argument of potentially significant noise impacts. Mitigation Measure Noise-I's

34 provisions, including limitations on operating several pieces of equipment

35

8-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

simultaneously and mandated use of noise shielding and muffling devices, do not
2 adequately address these potentially significant impacts.
3 37. The analysis of construction-related groundborne vibration (MND pp. B-52-B- 4 53) concludes that impacts to sensitive receptors would be less than significant, 5 relying on LAMC section 112.05's exemption from the threshold if all
6 technically feasible noise attenuation measures are implemented. As for noise 7 impacts, impacts from vibrations may still be significant despite the fact that the 8 LAMC exempts some vibration levels from its threshold. This supports a fair 9 argument that there are potentially significant effects from groundborne 10
=9910CN02 vibrations that will not be mitigated to a less-than-significant level.
38. The MND (p. B-53) explains that there would be a significant impact on noise
levels if the project caused the ambient noise level at the property line of affected
uses to increase by 5 dBA, or to increase by 3 dBA to or within the "normally
unacceptable" or "*clearly unacceptable" category (as shown in Table B-11). The
analysis of impacts from stationary operational sources such as HVAC
equipment concludes that impacts will be less than significant because LAMC
section 112.02 prohibits stationary noise sources from exceeding ambient levels
on other premises by more than 5 decibels, but fails to consider or evaluate the
20 other threshold of significance: whether the stationary noise sources associated 21 with the project will cause the noise level at the property line of affected uses to
22 increase by dBA sO as to enter the "normally unacceptable" or "clearly
23 unacceptable" category.

To the Attorney General of the State of California,
Please take notice that on January 10, 2020, this firm, on behalf of its client, Coalition for
an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the City of Los
Angeles, the Los Angeles City Council, and the Los Angeles Department of City Planning
(collectively, "City"). This letter provides the notice of lawsuit required by Public Resources Code
section 21167.7 and the Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The Petition alleges that the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") by approving a project with substantial adverse effects
ou the environment without the environmental review required by CEQA. The project at issue is
high density mixed-use residential-commercial project proposed on a 94,460 square feet lot located
in the community of Koreatown, along the border of the community of Macarthur Park. A copy of
the petition is included with this notice.
