106267670.1 0203628-00001

- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 Petitioners and Plaintiffs TEHAMA-COLUSA CANAL AUTHORITY, et al.

4 (collectively "Petitioners") bring this action under the California Environmental Quality Act

5 ("CEQA") (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) challenging decisions of Respondent and

6 Defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR") as lead agency

7 and CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ("CDFW") as responsible

8 agency (together, DWR and CDFW shall be referred to as "Respondents"), to certify and rely

9 upon a fatally defective environmental impact report ("EIR") as the basis for DWR's approval of

10 the Long-Term Operation of the California State Water Project (the "Project") and CDFW's

11 approval of an Incidental Take Permit ("ITP") for the Project. Petitioners all hold, or represent

12 parties that hold, agreements with the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") that

13 provide for water supply from the Central Valley Project ("CVP"). Petitioners, therefore, share

14 respective interests in the coordinated long-term operation of the CVP and State Water Project

15 ("SWP") and would be negatively and substantially affected by the Project's significant adverse

16 environmental impacts as well as Respondents' procedural violations and improper approvals.

17 Petitioners bring this action to compel Respondents to conduct an environmental review process

18 in full compliance with CEQA before implementing the Project or otherwise relying on the ITP.

2.

19 Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

20 section 1085 and/or section 1094.5 setting aside Respondents' approvals and ordering
Respondents to comply with their obligations under CEQA.

21 3.

22 Respondents' certification of and reliance on the EIR violates CEQA because,

23 although Respondents acknowledge that operation of the SWP is dependent on and

24 interconnected with the CVP operated by Reclamation, Respondents refused to meaningfully

25 consult and coordinate with this key agency as CEQA requires. Respondents ignored the

26 substance of numerous concerns raised by Reclamation, Petitioners, and others during the

27 administrative process, and Respondents proceeded to certify and rely upon a fundamentally
inadequate EIR.

28 4.

STOBL RIVES LLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW Respondents' failure to meaningfully consult with Reclamation not only violates
-4-

SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
106267670.1 0203628-00001

1 CEQA's mandatory procedural requirements and constitutes a failure to proceed in the manner

2 required by law, it also renders the EIR substantively deficient. Respondents could not and did

3 not provide basic information necessary to establish the existing environmental setting; describe

4 all essential elements of the Project; evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives; analyze

5 reasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the Project; or

6 enable Respondents to formulate effective mitigation measures. As a result, the EIR fails to

7 satisfy its basic informational purposes because it does not fairly or accurately describe how the

8 Project will be operated, and it does not disclose or mitigate the impacts that will result from such

9 operations.

10 5. Petitioners and others raised these issues in comments during the administrative

11 process leading to DWR's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project, and CDFW's

12 approval of the ITP; however, not only did Respondents fail to act on the comments, the

13 responses, including master responses, provided were perfunctory boilerplate answers which did

14 nothing to address the underlying deficiencies in the EIR. Respondents' failure to meaningfully

15 respond to comments that raised significant environmental issues and Respondents' decisions to

16 instead rely on a fundamentally inadequate EIR, and to adopt findings wholly unsupported by the

17 record of these proceedings, violates both the letter and the spirit of CEQA.

18 6. Because Respondents, as lead and responsible agencies, failed to proceed in the

19 manner required by law, prejudicially abused their discretion, and violated CEQA when they

20 certified and relied upon a fatally flawed EIR, Petitioners ask this Court to issue a peremptory

21 writ of mandate directing Respondents to: (1) set aside findings certifying and relying upon the

22 EIR; (2) set aside the Project and ITP approvals; and (3) order an injunction preventing

23 implementation of the Project or the issuance or implementation of any further Project-related

24 approvals by either agency until Respondents have fully complied with CEQA.

3 Lindsay, California, and serves its members in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, and Tulare

4 Counties.

5 10. Petitioner GLENN-COLUSA IRRIGATION DISTRICT ("GCID") is, and at all

6 times mentioned herein was, an irrigation district formed in 1920 pursuant to the California

7 Irrigation District Law to provide irrigation water to farms located in Glenn and Colusa Counties

8 in California. (Wat. Code, § 20500 et seq.) GCID consists of approximately 170,000 acres of

9 land within the Sacramento Valley. GCID holds a combination of pre- and post-1914

10 appropriative water rights to divert water from the Sacramento River and certain tributaries.

11 GCID also holds a water rights settlement contract with Reclamation ("Sacramento River

12 Settlement Contract" or "SRS Contract") regarding GCID's diversions from the Sacramento

13 River during the irrigation season. GCID diverts water from the Sacramento River at its pumping

14 facility near Hamilton City. The water is then conveyed through GCID's Main Canal and laterals

15 to more than 1,500 landowners. GCID's main office is in Willows, California.

16 11. Petitioner NATOMAS CENTRAL MUTUAL WATER COMPANY ("NCMWC*)

17 is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a California mutual water company organized and

18 existing under the laws of the State of California. NCMWC serves the water needs of landowners

2 mentioned herein was, a business entity organized and existing under the laws of the State of
California. RGF diverts water under riparian and appropriative rights from the Sacramento River

4 for the irrigation of approximately 6,450 acres in Yolo County. RGF holds an SRS Contract with
Reclamation. RGF's main office is in Knights Landing, California.

6 14. Petitioner SUTTER MUTUAL WATER COMPANY ("SMWC") is, and at all
times mentioned herein was, a California mutual water company organized and existing under the
laws of the State of California. SMWC holds appropriative water right licenses to divert from the
Sacramento River for the irrigation of approximately 50,100 acres in Sutter County. SMWC

10 holds an SRS Contract with Reclamation. SMWC's main office is in Robbins, California.

11 15. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR"

12 or "Respondent") is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a governmental agency and political

13 subdivision of the State of California, formed and existing under the California Water Code, with

14 its principal place of business in the County of Sacramento. Respondent operates the SWP.

15 Respondent's operation and management of the SWP is at all times subject to the obligations and

16 limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA and the CEQA

17 Guidelines. Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA, and in that capacity acted to certify the

18 EIR and approve the Project.

19 16. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE

20 ("CDFW" or "Respondent") is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a governmental agency

21 and political subdivision of the State of California, formed and existing under the California Fish

22 and Game Code, with its principal place of business in the County of Sacramento. Respondent is

23 a responsible agency under CEQA and is the public agency responsible for consideration of the

24 EIR and final action on DWR's application for an ITP pursuant to the California Endangered

25 Species Act (Fish & G. Code, § 2050 et seq.).

26 17. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

27 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 1 through DOE 50, inclusive,

28 and therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioners allege, upon

1 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some

2 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material interests affected

3 by the Project or Respondents' actions in connection with the Project. Petitioners will amend this
4 Petition to show the true names and capacities of DOES 1-50 if and when the same have been

5 ascertained.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 18. This Court has jurisdiction to review Respondents' findings, approvals, and

8 actions and issue a writ of mandate and/or injunctive relief, as well as other relief sought herein,

9 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq., 1060, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public

10 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

11 19. Venue for this action properly lies in the Fresno County Superior Court under

12 Code of Civil Procedure section 401, because Respondents DWR and CDFW are agencies of the

13 State of California, and the Attorney General has an office in Fresno County. Venue also is

14 proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 395 because extensive environmental impacts of

15 the Project will occur in Fresno County.

16 20. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

17 section 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on

18 April 28, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

19 21. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

20 section 21167.6(a) by concurrently filing a Notice of Election to Prepare the Record of

21 Proceedings relating to this action.

22 22. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

23 section 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on April 28,

24 2020. A copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 23. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

27 exhausted the available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioners

28 presented their specific objections to Respondents' decisions through detailed written comments
STOEL RIVES LLP -9-
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
106267670.1 0203628-00001

submitted to Respondents either independently, as signatories, or through their member

2 organizations, on the Notice of Preparation, the Draft EIR, the Final EIR, and ITP Application,

3 requesting compliance with CEQA, including completion of full and adequate environmental

4 review. Petitioners actively participated in the administrative process that preceded certification

5 of the EIR and issuance of the ITP, to the extent Respondents' dismissive approach to

6 proceedings allowed such participation. All other or further requests of Respondents, including
7 those previously been made, are futile.

8 24. Petitioners have fully exhausted all administrative remedies in that the

9 determinations by DWR and CDFW are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are

10 provided by state or local law.

11 STANDING

12 25. As described above, Petitioners are beneficially interested in the subject matter of

13 this proceeding because implementation of the Project and ITP may adversely affect the

14 availability of surface and groundwater supplies that Petitioners rely on for irrigation and

15 municipal and other uses. Furthermore, to maintain and enhance their operations, Petitioners rely
16 on the health and survival of the ecosystem and environmental resources in the areas where

17 Petitioners and their member organizations or customers are located, including fish, wildlife, and

18 agricultural resources. Petitioners and their member organizations or customers will be directly

19 injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in connection with the Project and ITP, as
20 Petitioners' operations will be impacted by significant environmental effects that have not been

21 adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated.

22 26. Petitioners have standing in the public interest because this case involves public

23 rights and the enforcement of public duties. As lead and responsible agencies, DWR and CDFW

24 have a mandatory duty to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA.

25 Petitioners are not seeking relief greater than or different from relief sought for the general public.

26 If successful, this action would enforce the mandates of CEQA, including the public's right to

27 adequate and informative environmental review under that statute.

28 27. Petitioners filed the claims alleged in this Petition prior to the expiration of any

applicable statute of limitations, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167, as this

2 action was brought within 30 days of DWR's Notice of Determination.

3 ATTORNEYS' FEES

4 28. In seeking to compel Respondents to lawfully discharge their mandatory public

5 duties, Petitioners are acting in their capacity as private attorneys general in the interest and for

6 the benefit of the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other

7 applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the

8 relief requested in this Petition will constitute a significant public benefit by requiring

9 Respondents to carry out their duties as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA in compliance

10 with the law.

11 29. Further, Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among other things, that

12 Respondents' actions in connection with the Project and ITP were and continue to be arbitrary

13 and capricious. Pursuant to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioners

14 are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this action to redress Respondents' arbitrary

15 and capricious actions in connection with the Project.

16 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW - STAY AND INJUNCTION

17 30. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public

18 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court may stay or enjoin operation of any

19 administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding.

20 31. Because Respondents, as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA, have

21 approved the Project and ITP, there is a real threat that Respondents will proceed to implement

22 the Project and ITP despite inadequate environmental review of the impacts of those actions.

23 Given Respondents' violations of CEQA by certifying the EIR and approving the Project and

24 issuing the ITP in reliance on that unlawfully certified EIR, any action to implement the Project

25 and ITP is null and void. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for the

26 irreparable harm that would result from Respondents' implementation of the Project and ITP. A

27 stay or preliminary or permanent injunction is necessary to restrain DWR and CDFW from taking

P additional actions to implement the Project and ITP until Respondents have complied with

2 CEQA.

3 32. A stay or injunction of Respondents' actions relating to the Project and ITP would
4 not be against the public interest because DWR and CDFW are required to conduct adequate

5 environmental review of the Project and ITP prior to approval, because operation of the Project

6 and reliance on the ITP would likely have significant impacts on the environment, and because

7 Respondents will not be harmed by a stay or injunction.

8 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

9 33. The SWP is a water storage and delivery system of reservoirs, aqueducts, power

10 plants, and pumping plants extending more than 700 miles - two-thirds the length of California.

11 Planned, constructed, and operated by Respondent DWR, the SWP supplies water to more than

12 27 million people in northern California, the Bay Area, the San Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast,

13 and southern California.

14 34. The SWP was designed to deliver nearly 4.2 million acre-feet of water per year.

15 Water is received by 29 long-term SWP water supply contractors that in turn distribute SWP

16 water to farms, homes, and industry. The quantity of available SWP water supply depends on

17 rainfall, snowpack, runoff, water in storage facilities, and pumping capacity from the Delta, as

18 well as operational constraints for fish and wildlife protection, water quality, and environmental

19 and legal restrictions.

20 35. DWR operates the SWP in cooperation with the Reclamation's operation of the

21 CVP, pursuant to a Coordinated Operations Agreement ("COA"). One of the primary goals of

22 this cooperation is to limit salinity intrusion into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun

23 Marsh.

24 36. On April 19, 2019, DWR issued a Notice of Preparation of an Environmental

25 Impact Report and Scoping Meetings for the Long-Term Operation of the California State Water

26 Project, and during the period from April 22 through May 27, 2019, accepted written comments

27 regarding the issues that should be addressed in the EIR.

28 37. Despite the complexity and statewide significance of the environmental issues

1 presented by DWR's proposed action, it hurriedly issued the Draft EIR fewer than six months

2 later, on November 21, 2019, acknowledging that the Draft EIR was intended to support decisions

3 regarding ongoing SWP operations that appear to have already been made.

4 38. The Draft EIR was circulated for public review from November 21, 2019 through

5 January 6, 2020. After the Draft EIR was released for public review, on December 13, 2019,

6 DWR submitted an application to CDFW for an ITP for the Project ("ITP Application"). The ITP

7 Application proposed different and additional elements of SWP operations not described in the

8 Draft EIR project description. Numerous interested parties, including Petitioners, Reclamation,

9 and other entities submitted detailed comment letters urging DWR to address significant

10 environmental issues that had been ignored in the fundamentally deficient Draft EIR. These

11 defects stemmed largely from inconsistencies between the Project as described in the Draft EIR

12 and DWR's ITP Application, insufficient information about elements of the Project both as

13 described in the Draft EIR and as DWR proposed to modify the Project through the ITP

14 Application, and DWR's refusal to meaningfully consult and coordinate with Reclamation,

15 resulting in foundational problems with the EIR's baseline for assessment of environmental

16 impacts, environmental setting, project description, and other key areas of analysis.

17 39. On or about March 17, 2020, DWR provided certain public agencies with an

18 administrative Final EIR, including responses to comments by those public agencies responding

19 to the Draft EIR. Some Petitioners and/or their member agencies objected to the adequacy of the

20 proposed responses to their comments, to the EIR's adequacy and to the Project as described in

21 the administrative Final EIR, in written comments provided to DWR prior to March 27, 2020.

22 Notwithstanding these objections, on March 27, 2020, DWR adopted Findings of Fact and

23 certified a Final EIR for the Project. On March 30, 2020, DWR filed a Notice of Determination

24 (*NOD") with the State Clearinghouse pursuant to CEQA.

25 40. The Final EIR certified by DWR materially revised what had been identified as

26 "Alternative 2B" in the Draft EIR, effectively creating a new alternative, which DWR labeled as

27 the "Refined Alternative 2b." Although DWR characterized its changes to Alternative 2B as

28 refinements, the lead agency cherry-picked elements from a range of options and combined them

1 into an entirely new Project not reflected, and not fairly and adequately described or analyzed, in

2 the Draft EIR circulated for public review. The Final EIR also failed to squarely address or

3 resolve other significant issues identified in comments on the Draft EIR or on the administrative

4 draft Final EIR.

5 41. On March 31, 2020, in reliance on DWR's certified Final EIR, Respondent CDFW

6 adopted Findings of Fact and issued DWR ITP Number 2081-2019-066-00 in connection with
"Refined Alternative 2b." This action violated CDFW's duties as a responsible agency to

8 independently review and approve the CEQA document for the proposed action and not
reflexively rely on the lead agency's judgments.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violations of CEQA Against All Respondents - Inadequacy of EIR as Informational

12 Document)

13 42. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set
14 forth above.

15 43. CEQA requires an agency to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

16 proposed actions in an EIR. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public

17 in general with detailed information about the likely effects of a proposed project on the

18 environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.) An EIR must fully analyze and disclose all of the

19 project's potentially significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100(b)(1).)

20 To be considered adequate, an EIR must, at a minimum, provide a sufficient degree of analysis

21 and information to enable decision-makers to take action that intelligently accounts for

22 environmental consequences. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

23 44. In addition to full disclosure and analysis of the environmental effects of the

24 proposed action, CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent DWR, to identify

25 effective and enforceable mitigation measures to avoid or substantially lessen the proposal's

26 adverse impacts; to consider a range of alternatives and to implement them where feasible; to

27 make adequate findings, including a statement of overriding considerations for those significant

28 environmental impacts that cannot be avoided; and to do all of these things meaningfully and in

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

good faith, in a public forum, before the agency's decision is made. Respondent DWR, as lead

2 agency, violated CEQA by failing to comply with these requirements, by failing to proceed in the

3 manner required by law, by certifying an EIR that failed to minimally serve its informational
purposes, and by making findings not supported by substantial evidence.

5 45. Respondent CDFW, as a responsible agency, violated CEQA and prejudicially
1O abused its discretion by failing to exercise its independent judgment regarding the adequacy of

7 the EIR, including failing to determine the necessity, effectiveness, feasibility, and

8 constitutionality of mitigation measures and alternatives capable of avoiding or substantially

9 lessening the Project's significant impacts, failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and

10 making findings not supported by substantial evidence.

11 46. Respondents ignored the substance of significant environmental and other

12 concerns raised by Petitioners and others during the administrative process and proceeded to

13 certify and rely upon a fundamentally inadequate EIR to support decisions already made

14 concerning the Project and ITP, in violation of Respondents' mandatory duties under CEQA as

15 lead and responsible agencies. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondent DWR - Failure to Consult with Reclamation)

18 47. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

19 forth above.

20 48. A lead agency preparing an EIR must notify and seek input from all responsible

21 and trustee agencies, including appropriate federal agencies, regarding "the scope and content of

22 the information that is germane to the statutory responsibilities" of that agency in connection with

23 the proposed project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21080.4(a), 21092; CEQA Guidelines,

24 ccn 15082(a), (b).) Before completing an EIR, the lead agency must again consult with and invite

25 comments from all responsible and trustee agencies, including any federal agency that has

26 jurisdiction by law with respect to the project or exercises authority over resources that may be

27 affected by the project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21104(a), 21153(a); CEQA Guidelines,

28 § 15086.)

106267670.1 0203628-00001

49. On November 22, 2019, Respondent DWR issued its Draft EIR for the Project in

2 which it noted Reclamation's operation of the CVP in coordination with DWR's operation of the

3 SWP under the terms of the COA. Throughout the Draft EIR, Respondent DWR acknowledged a
multitude of instances in which Project implementation requires coordination with Reclamation,

5 but it consistently characterized those efforts in the future tense, deferring any meaningful
analysis of coordinated operations by using terms such as "will" and "would."

7 50. Despite the critical nature of required coordination between the two agencies,

8 Respondent DWR did not: (1) coordinate with Reclamation on the development of the Draft EIR;

9 or (2) as of the date of Reclamation's comments on the Draft EIR, initiate discussions with

10 Reclamation on the manner in which the SWP operations contemplated in the EIR would be

11 coordinated with Reclamation's planned operations for the CVP. Reclamation's January 6, 2020

12 comment letter explains:

13 Overall, the DEIR lacks necessary details and does not adequately
14 describe how [Respondent] and Reclamation's proposed operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project
15 will work in concert. Since the DEIR was developed in an absence of dialogue with Reclamation, it is speculative to draw conclusions
16 about how the differences in proposed joint operation between the [Environmental Impact Statement] and DEIR will be resolved, and

17 the resulting environmental conditions are therefore unknown. (DEIR, Letter F-Reclamation-1)

18 51. Reclamation recognized, in its January 6, 2020, letter, that the Project's proposed

19 alternatives will result in different operational parameters for the CVP and SWP making

20 implementation of the agencies' "mutual obligations for the coordinated operations challenging

21 under the critical Coordinated Operations Agreement." (DEIR, Letter F-Reclamation-1.)

22 Because the Draft EIR contained new obligations for the SWP, which impact Reclamation

23 because of the Projects' coordinated operations, CEQA required DWR to describe how these

24 obligations would be met and to analyze the environmental effects of doing so. As comments on

25 the Draft EIR pointed out, "[wlithout an understanding of how the new obligations included in

26 the DEIR would be met and accounted for (which would create different objectives on the same

27 system), the impacts of these actions on both the Central Valley Project and [State Water Project]

28 cannot be analyzed."

106267670.1 0203628-00001

1 52. Reclamation's comments on the Draft EIR provided a detailed breakdown of the

2 crucial factors DWR failed to address, including, but not limited to, the following:

3 (a) the Project's additional outflow requires an accounting under the COA to

4 understand effects on CVP operations and to disclose and analyze resulting
40• environmental impacts;

(b) an adequate EIR must identify effects on CVP reservoir operations,

7 including effects related to river temperatures or water supplies;

8 (c) the CalSim model did not accurately represent how Reclamation would
9 operate the CVP and thus distorted the resulting environmental analysis

10 and conclusions;

11 (d) DWR has predicated implementation of the Project on Reclamation

12 providing additional Delta outflow, but this additional output has not been

13 provided, and therefore may not occur as intended;

14 (e) implementation of the Project could affect the CVP's ability to deliver

15 water and the resulting significant environmental impacts are not described

16 in the EIR; and

17 (f) Reclamation concluded that coordination between it and Respondent DWR

18 is critical, and "[o]perating to different criteria creates challenges for both

19 real-time operations and seasonal long-term planning." DWR nevertheless

20 refused to coordinate with Reclamation before proceeding to approve the

21 Project.

22 53. Respondent DWR's failure to meaningfully consult and coordinate with

23 Reclamation resulted in omission of "material necessary to informed decisionmaking and

24 informed public participation. Case law is clear that, in such cases, the error is prejudicial."

25 (Schenck v. County of Sonoma (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 949, 957.) Respondent DWR's inaction

26 violated the requirements of CEQA, and is prejudicial as a matter of law.

27 54. Respondent DWR's failure to meaningfully consult with Reclamation also renders

28 the EIR substantively deficient in innumerable ways. DWR could not and did not provide basic

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

information necessary to establish the existing environmental setting; describe all essential

• 2 elements of the Project and evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives; analyze their reasonably
foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts; or enable the agencies to
formulate effective mitigation measures. As a result, the EIR fails to satisfy its basic
informational purposes because it does not fairly or accurately describe how the Project will be

6 operated, and it does not disclose or mitigate the impacts that will result from such operations.

55. Numerous Project elements unlawfully assume future coordination between DWR
and Reclamation, because DWR asserts it cannot reasonably foresee how Reclamation might

9 operate the CVP with the Project in place and that impacts outside the narrow geographic scope

10 of the EIR somehow are "speculative." DWR's assertions are not supported by substantial

11 evidence, however, and violate CEQA's requirements that the lead agency "use its best efforts to

12 find out and disclose all that it reasonably can" to adequately describe important elements of the

13 project and to analyze the impacts of its implementation. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15144, 15378;

14 Planning & Conservation League v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 210,

15 242.) This duty extends to analysis and disclosure of all direct, reasonably foreseeable indirect,

16 and cumulative impacts of project implementation, whether or not they occur within the lead

17 agency's jurisdiction. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21065, 21100; CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.)

18 56. DWR's failure to take even minimally necessary steps to comply with its duties as

19 lead agency violates CEQA. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required by law and

20 prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

21 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Description)

24 57. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

27 the proposed Project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124.) The Project description must contain

1 specific information about the basic components of the proposed activity to allow a complete

2 assessment of its environmental impacts.

3 59. In violation of CEQA, the EIR's project description lacks basic information as to

4 how the SWP will be coordinated with Reclamation's operation of the CVP, as analyzed in the

5 biological opinions issued in October 2019 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National

6 Marine Fisheries Service under the federal Endangered Species Act. Instead, the EIR purports to

7 artificially narrow the geographic scope of the Project and omits discussion of potential impacts

8 north of the Delta and to CVP operations and water supplies because DWR allegedly "cannot

9 reasonably foresee how Reclamation might respond to" SWP operations. Elsewhere, however,

10 DWR acknowledges that it "operates the SWP in coordination with the CVP, under the

11 Coordinated Operation Agreement (COA) between the federal government and the State of

12 California (authorized by Public Law 99-546)" (Draft EIR, p. 1-3), and the proposed project

13 operations largely assume extensive coordination with Reclamation. (See, e.g., Draft EIR, pp. 3-

14 18 - 3-38 [OMR Management].) The Draft EIR refers to "proportional share" of requirements

15 and "equitable" coordination between SWP and CVP operations but fails to define either term,

16 fails to describe whether and how requirements imposed only on the SWP constitute coordination

17 between the SWP and CVP, and fails to describe whether and how CVP operations are affected.

18 This lack of basic information makes it impossible to analyze and mitigate potentially significant

19 impacts of the Project.

20 60. To meaningfully describe the Project, including the ITP, and its potential

21 alternatives as CEQA requires, the details of coordination between SWP and CVP facilities

22 cannot be merely implied or inferred. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15124(c), 15378; Sierra Club v.

23 City of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 535.) DWR's artificially narrow scope of analysis

24 lacks sufficient detail about how changes to SWP operations under the Project and ITP will result

25 in changes to upstream operations for both the SWP and the CVP. The EIR did not analyze the

26 resulting environmental effects of such changes, identify mitigation measures, or consider

27 alternative approaches. The EIR failed to provide enough detail regarding the "whole of the

action" and its potential impacts, particularly in connection with "Refined Alternative 2b" and the

2 ITP, to foster meaningful public participation and informed agency decision-making.

61. Moreover, "an accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of

4 an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr. v. County of Merced

5 (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655, quoting County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71

6 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) "A curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project description draws a red herring

7 across the path of public input." (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at p. 198.) "[O]nly

8 through an accurate view of the project may the public and interested parties and public agencies

9 balance the proposed project's benefits against its environmental cost, consider appropriate

10 mitigation measures, assess the advantages of terminating the proposal and properly weigh other

11 alternatives.." (San Joaquin, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 655, quoting City of Santee v. County

12 of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454.)

13 62. An EIR that describes one project but analyzes another does not meet CEQA's

14 basic objectives of promoting informed decision-making. (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d

15 at p. 197 [EIR's "incessant shifts among different project descriptions .. . vitiate the city's EIR

16 process as a vehicle for intelligent public participation"]; see also W. Placer Citizens for an Agric.

17 & Rural Env't v. County of Placer (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 890, 898 [the project analyzed must

18 be consistent with the project description, "[t]he defined project and not some different project

19 must be the EIR's bona fide subject"].)

20 63. Here, not only is the EIR's project description lacking in basic information about

21 the proposed activity, but it materially it changed between the outset of the environmental review

22 process including circulation of the Draft EIR, and DWR's hurried certification of the Final EIR,

23 approval of the Project, and CDFW's issuance of the ITP. The Draft EIR describes a project that

24 is materially different from the Project described in DWR's ITP Application, the Final EIR, and

25 ultimately the ITP. The Final EIR substantially revised what had been "Alternative 2B" in the

26 Draft EIR and effectively created a new alternative labeled "Refined Alternative 2b." Refined

27 Alternative 2b significantly departs from the original Alternative 2B, because DWR improperly

28 combined several different approaches to essential components of the proposed activity, resulting

1 at the 11th hour - in an entirely new project not reflected, and not fairly and adequately

2 described or analyzed, in the earlier Draft EIR. None of the project alternatives analyzed in the

3 Draft EIR included all essential features Respondents approved with the label "Refined

4 Alternative 2B."

5 64. As a result of the EIR's inadequate and unstable project description, DWR

6 improperly deferred analysis of the impacts of this hybrid action and reached impact conclusions

7 not supported by substantial evidence, in violation of CEQA's basic requirements. (Pub.

8 Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.) DWR further failed to identify feasible and effective

0 measures to mitigate the impacts of its action, failed to meaningfully evaluate alternatives,

10 adopted Findings of Fact unsupported by substantial evidence, and failed to bridge the analytical

11 gap between evidence in the record and the agency's decision. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002,

12 21156; CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.) Respondent DWR's failure to provide an adequate and

13 stable project description with all required information about the proposed activity constitutes a

14 failure to proceed in the manner required by law and is a prejudicial abuse of discretion in

15 violation of CEQA.

16 § 15126.2(a); San Joaquin, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at p. 660.) These impacts must also be

17 discussed and analyzed to determine the "cumulative effect on the environment of the subject

18 project in conjunction with other closely related past, present and reasonably foreseeable probable

19 future projects." (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27

20 Cal.App.4th 713, 719; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063(b)(1), 15355.) The cumulative impacts of a

21 project can "appear insignificant when considered individually, but assume threatening

22 dimensions when considered collectively with other sources with which they interact."

23 (Communities for a Better Env't v. Cal. Res. Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 114, disproved

24 on another ground in Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Ca.4th 1086.)

25 71. Respondent DWR violated CEQA in certifying the Final EIR and approving the

26 Project because the EIR failed to analyze reasonably foreseeable significant direct, indirect, and

27 cumulative impacts, including, but not limited to, impacts on CVP operations, water supplies,

28 groundwater resources, and aquatic species resulting from operational changes such as reduction

1 of water deliveries, increased upstream releases and Sacramento River flow in May, increases in

2 Yolo Bypass flow due to an increase in upstream reservoir spills in December through March,

3 reduced flow in the Sacramento River below Keswick in September and November of wet years,

4 and reduced Shasta storage in certain year types from June through December. The analysis

5 failed to adequately consider effects on the CVP related to its ability to achieve certain water

6 temperature actions (coldwater management in CVP reservoirs) and failed to provide any

7 mitigation for such impacts; notwithstanding the fact that the Project and alternatives could affect

8 coordinated operations between the SWP and the CVP and thus could negatively affect CVP

, operations, which could have significant adverse environmental impacts.

10 72. DWR's failure to analyze the reasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and

11 cumulative impacts of the Project violated CEQA. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required

12 by law and prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

13 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondent DWR - Failure to Adequately Respond to

15 Comments)

16 73. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

17 forth above.

18 74. CEQA requires the lead agency to provide "good faith, reasoned analysis in

19 response" to comments on the Draft EIR, and "[c]onclusory statements unsupported by factual

20 information will not suffice." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088(c).) In particular, where comments

21 from responsible experts disclose new or conflicting data or opinions that cause concern that the

22 lead agency may not have fully evaluated the project and its alternatives, these comments may not

23 simply be ignored.

24 75. Respondent DWR failed to respond to numerous comments raising significant

25 environmental concerns regarding the lack of information in the Draft EIR. Petitioners and other

26 commenters on the Draft EIR raised concerns regarding the adequacy of the EIR's project

27 description, baseline, and environmental setting; the modeling that formed the basis of the EIR's

28 analysis and impact conclusions; the need for and adequacy of mitigation measures; the

106267670.1 0203628-00001

- description and evaluation of alternatives; and other significant issues that exposed the overall

• 2 inadequacy of the EIR as an informational document.

76. The Final EIR's responses to comments, including master responses, consist

4 primarily of boilerplate language and summaries of CEQA requirements that sidestep the specific
issues raised in comments on the Draft EIR. As Petitioners and others subsequently explained in
comments on the Final EIR, these responses are inadequate and violate CEQA because they do
not squarely respond to the significant and specific environmental concerns Petitioners and other
commenters raised. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088(b); Covington v. Great Basin Unified Air

9 Pollution Control Dist. (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 867.)

10 77. Despite these concerns, DWR did not revise the EIR to correct its fundamental

11 deficiencies. DWR ignored the substance of nearly all the comments on the Draft EIR and Final

12 EIR; instead the lead agency responded, if at all, with conclusory statements unsupported by

13 substantial evidence in the record and that do not reflect a good-faith, reasoned response. In this

14 way, DWR again violated CEQA, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

15 prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

16 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondent DWR - Failure to Recirculate)

18 78. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

19 forth above.

20 79. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after notice

21 of public review is given but before final certification of the EIR, the lead agency must issue a

22 new notice and recirculate the revised draft EIR for public comment and public agency

23 consultation. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5(a).) New information that triggers the recirculation

24 requirement may include changes in the project as well as evidence of a new, or substantially

25 more severe, significant impact. (Ibid.) Recirculation is also required when the draft EIR was

26 "so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature" that public comment on the

27 draft EIR was essentially meaningless. (Ibid.)

28 80. As demonstrated in the comments of Petitioners and others on the Draft EIR,

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
106267670.1 0203628-00001

1 DWR was required to revise and recirculate the EIR due to the significant changes in the Project

2 between the Draft and Final EIRs and the fundamental inadequacy of both the Draft EIR and the

3 Final EIR certified by DWR.

4 81. DWR failed to recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR as required by CEQA.

5 As a result, Petitioners, the public, and other public agencies were deprived of a meaningful

6 opportunity to review and comment on the approved Project and its substantial adverse

7 environmental consequences. By failing to revise and recirculate the EIR, DWR failed to proceed

8 in the manner required by law, and its decision to approve the Project was not supported by

9 substantial evidence.

10 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violations of CEQA Against All Respondents - Insufficient Findings)

12 82. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

13 forth above.

14 83. CEQA Guidelines section 15091(a) requires a lead agency to make specific written

15 findings for each significant effect identified in an EIR. Specifically, the agency must make one

16 of three findings: (1) that changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated in, the

17 project that avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect; (2) that such

18 changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency, and

19 that such changes have been adopted or can and should be adopted by that agency; or (3) specific

20 economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation

21 measures or project alternatives identified in the EIR. These findings must be supported by

22 substantial evidence in the administrative record. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)

23 84. CEQA likewise requires a responsible agency to independently consider the

24 information in the EIR prepared by the lead agency and reach its own conclusions on whether and

25 how to approve the project involved. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15096.) Thus, a as a responsible

26 agency under CEQA, CDFW was required to make the findings required by CEQA Guidelines

27 section 15091 for each significant effect of the Project, including findings as to any feasible

28 alternative or feasible mitigation measures within its responsibility that would substantially lessen

or avoid any significant effect the Project would have on the environment, and its findings must

2 be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (CEQA Guidelines,

3 § 15091(b).)

4 85. Neither DWR's nor CDFW's findings in support of certification of the EIR,

5 approval of the Project and issuance of the ITP are supported by substantial evidence in the

6 record. These deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:

7 (a) Findings regarding the feasibility of alternatives;

(b) The finding that the Project is the environmentally superior alternative;

9 (c) The findings regarding environmental impacts, including, but not limited

10 to, surface water and groundwater supply impacts, including the scope and

11 significance of impacts and the necessity, constitutionality, effectiveness,

12 and feasibility of mitigation; and

13 (d) The findings regarding aquatic resources and other biological impacts,

14 including the scope and significance of impacts and the effectiveness of

15 mitigation.

16 86. The EIR fails to disclose the true scope of the Project impacts, including, but not

17 limited to, impacts to surface water and groundwater supply and aquatic and other biological

18 resources.

19 87. As lead agency and a responsible agency under CEQA, respectively, Respondents

20 DWR and CDFW made findings that are not supported by substantial evidence, and therefore

21 approval of the Project and ITP based upon those findings constitutes a failure to proceed in the

22 manner required by law and is a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
23 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violations of CEQA Against All Respondents - EIR Inadequate for Responsible Agency

25 Approvals)

26 88. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

27 forth above.

28 89. As detailed herein, DWR failed to comply with CEQA in connection with the
STOEL RIVES LLP -26-

1 preparation and certification of the EIR. DWR has failed to proceed in the manner required by

2 law, and its conclusions and findings are not supported by substantial evidence. These prejudicial

3 abuses of discretion render the EIR inadequate to support DWR's approval of the Project as well

4 as related approvals.

5 90. Similarly, the prejudicial abuses of discretion described herein render the EIR

6 inadequate under CEQA for purposes of responsible agency approvals, including Respondent

7 CDFW's approval of the ITP. The EIR simply fails as an informational document and cannot

8 support the approval of any permit or project.

q 91. The EIR is inadequate to support issuance of the ITP in a variety of respects,

10 including, but not limited to, its failure to analyze impacts on CVP operations, water supplies,

11 groundwater resources, and aquatic species resulting from operational changes such as reduction

12 of water deliveries; increased upstream releases and Sacramento River flow in May; increases in

13 Yolo Bypass flow due to an increase in upstream reservoir spills in December through March,

14 without addressing the effects; reduced flow in the Sacramento River below Keswick in

15 September and November of wet years; and reduced Shasta storage in certain year types from

16 June through December. The analysis failed to consider effects on the CVP related to

17 temperature impacts and failed to provide any mitigation for such impacts. These actions could

18 substantially affect coordinated operations between the SWP and the CVP and could negatively

19 affect CVP operations and coldwater management actions, and in turn have significant adverse

20 environmental impacts not analyzed in the EIR relied upon by DWR and CDFW.

21 92. For these reasons, among others, the flawed EIR is inadequate to support

22 responsible agency approval, and DWR and CDFW have prejudicially abused their discretion in

23 certifying and relying upon the EIR. Furthermore, DWR and CDFW made findings as to the

24 adequacy of the document for purposes of responsible agency approvals that are not supported by

25 substantial evidence.

2

3 (Violations of CEQA Against All Respondents - Improper Incorporation of Mitigation
Measures in Project Description; Inadequate Mitigation)

4 93.

5 forth above. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set

6 94.

7 The primary purpose of the SWP is water supply. Consistent with that purpose,

8 the Project is DWR's plan for the long-term operation of water storage and conveyance facilities,
including conveyance of water through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

9 95.

10 To reduce impacts of SWP operations on aquatic species, and secure CDFW's

11 approval of an ITP, the Project included a variety of new components that never have been part of

12 DWR's operation of the SWP, including, but not limited to, the requirement that substantial

13 "blocks" of water (totaling up to 250,000 acre-feet in any given year) be dedicated to Delta

14 outflow (rather than SWP water service) and provisions for vague and unspecified SWP

15 operational decision-making by and at the sole discretion of CDFW. The EIR mischaracterized

16 what were plainly mitigation measures as Project components. This prevented the EIR from

17 appropriately analyzing the Project's environmental impacts and potential mitigation measures,
including the impacts of the mitigation measures themselves.

18 96.

19 To the extent the Project components are mitigation, they are legally inadequate

20 because they are vague, incomplete, untested, infeasible, and lack defined performance standards,
and constitute impermissible deferred mitigation.

Re: NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA ACTION

Dear Ms. Nemeth and Mr. Bonham:

Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, please take notice that the Tehama-Colusa
Canal Authority, San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority, Friant Water Authority, Glenn-
Colusa Irrigation District, Reclamation District 108, Natomas Central Mutual Water Company, River Garden Farms Company, and the Sutter Mutual Water Company intend to file a petition
for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) against the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW").
The action will challenge DWR's certification and reliance on a defective environmental impact
report as the basis for DWR's Long-Term Operation of the California State Water Project (the "Project") and CDFW's approval of an Incidental Take Permit for the Project. The petition will seek to vacate DWR's and CDFW's actions and approvals related to the Project. This action will
be filed with the Fresno County Superior Court.

Very truly yours,
