1 Petitioner, ADVOCATES FOR ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE ("Petitioner"), alleges
2 through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
5 "Respondent") of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and the related discretionary approvals
6 (together, the "Project Approvals") for a proposed development project located at 2520, 2532,
7 2608, 2668 North Eastern Avenue and 2647, 2649, 2651 Lombardy Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA
8 90032 (the "Project"). As noted below, the City failed to follow the required procedures
9 required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it adopted the Mitigated
10 Negative Declaration for the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial in

8 11 that it precluded informed decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the Project will have d77 Group, MET leuueuo 90211 SI!H 2OS PNE BLMBIM EA DE Beverly 12 substantial adverse impacts on the environment,
13 2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
14 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
15 with construction. The Advisory Agency for the City of Los Angeles adopted a Mitigated
16 Negative Declaration for the Project on March 3, 2020. The Advisory Agency also approved a
17 Vesting Tentative Tract for the Project. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project
18 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
19 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
20 and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
21 3. Petitioner seeks Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
23 Approvals and the environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with
24 CEQA.

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

3 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

10. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the
5 Code of Civil Procedure.

0 11. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
7 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County.

8 PROJECT

9 12. The Project Site is a vacant, irregularly-shaped site comprised of multiple lots and
10 approximately 218,270 gross square feet of lot area. The Project Site has approximately 780 feet
11
8 of frontage along the eastern side of Eastern Avenue and 200 feet of frontage along the southern
d11 'dnoJo men jauueuo 90211 12
LOS VOIS LHASIM CECE SIH Auereg side of Lombardy Boulevard. The site is currently raw land and contains 102 Protected Trees and
13 72 non-protected trees. The western portion of the site located along Eastern Avenue is an
14 upward sloping hillside with a steep slope. The southern, eastern, and northwestern portion of the
15 site also consists of an upward sloping hillside; however, it is a more gradual slope than the
16 western portion.
17 13. The proposed Project is for the new construction, use, and maintenance of 42
18 small lot homes located on an approximately 218,270 gross square-foot lot located generally at
19 2520 North Eastern Avenue. The small lot homes will have approximately 2,000 square feet of
20 floor area, an attached two (2) car garage, with a maximum height of 26 feet.
21 14. The Project will require the removal of 39 of 102 Protected Trees (Southern
22 California Black Walnut trees) located on the site and the grading and export of approximately
23 78,000 cubic yards of dirt. The Project will require the construction of a total of 178 retaining
24 walls throughout the site, comprised of 129 walls that will be less than 3 feet in height, 18 walls
25 with height between 3 and 4 feet, and 32 walls with a height between 4 and 6 feet. An

5 Advisory Agency. A Zoning Administrator's Determination is also required to permit the

6 retaining walls proposed. A Zoning Administrator's Adjustment is also required due to the over
7 height retaining walls in the front, side and rear yards.
8 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

10 2020 to consider the Vesting Tentative Tract and Mitigated Negative Declaration. On March 3, 9 16, The Advisory Agency and Hearing Officer held a public hearing on January 23,

8 11 2020, the Advisory Agency approved Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. 73531-SL under d77 'dnoJs ME7 |auUHO -LZ06 12 incidental Case No. VTT-73531-SL for a maximum of 42 small lots. In addition to the approval

'SIIH ALSA9S 14 78,000 cubic yards of dirt. The Advisory Agency also adopted the Mitigated Negative
15 / Declaration.

16 17. The City filed a Notice of Determination with the County Recorder on March 25,

18| actions until 90 days after the Governor lists the state of emergency that currently exist in 17 2020; however, on April 6, 2020 the Judicial Council tolled the statute of limitations for all civil

19 California.

20 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
21 18. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
22 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
23 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
24 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
25 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
26 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
2 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
3 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

4 19. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
5 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have

6 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
7 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
8  by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California
9 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and

10 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.

11 20. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
90211 OSA  F E BUM 3OS VOIS EHUSIDA ERO8 SI!H Auereg 12 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
13 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

14 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
15 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
16 V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
17 21. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
18  declaration that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
19 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
20 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
21 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
22 points of no return," Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
23 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
24 22. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not excmpt and may cause
25 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
26 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
27

28 6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal

2 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have significant effect on the environment if there is a

3 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los

4 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202

5 Cal.App.3d 296, 309. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an EIR. Pocket

6 Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App. 4th 903, 928; Bowman v. City of Berkeley

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 10

11 23. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
LIZ06 or pPp p El 12 ES MPIE T H SI NG SSO SIlH AJeAea their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
13 24. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy ("SMMC" or "Conservancy") is a
14 public agency that submitted comments during the public review period required by CEQA
15 Guidelines §15073. The Conservancy submitted a letter to City on May 22, 2017 in response to
16 the draft Mitigated Negative Declaration. The public review began on April 6, 2017 and closed
17 on May 24, 2017. The City violated CEQA Guidelines §15073(e) by failing to provide written
18 notice to the Conservancy of the public hearing for the Project conducted on January 23, 2020.
19 This section of the Guidelines states as follows: "The lead agency shall notify in writing any
20 public agency which comments on a proposed negative declaration or mitigated negative
21 declaration of any public hearing to be held for the project for which the document was prepared.
22 A notice provided to a public agency pursuant to Section 15072 satisfies this requirement."
23 25. A "trustee agency" is defined in Public Resources Code as "a state agency that
24 has jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by a project, that are held in trust for the
25 people of the State of California." Public Resources Code § 21070. The CEQA Guidelines state
26 that a trustee agency "means a state agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources

2 agencies include: (a) The California Department of Fish and Game with regard to the fish and
3 wildlife of the state, to designated rare or endangered native plants, and to game refuges,

4 ecological reserves, and other areas administered by the department." California Code of

5 Regulations § 15386.

7 formerly known as the California Department of Fish and Game, is a state agency under the 6 26. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW or "Department"),

8 California Natural Resources Agency, The Department has been tasked with a key role in
9 reviewing environmental documents to assess biological impacts to fish and wildlife resources.
10 Fish & Game Code 1802 states as follows: "The Department has "jurisdiction over the
11 conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary g L1Z06 d71 'dnoJ9 ME T leuueyd 12 for biologically sustainable populations of those species. The department, as trustee for fish and

8 eung "pALE EUlus|!M €888 13 wildlife resources, shall consult with lead and responsible agencies and shall provide, as
'SIIIH ApeAS 14 available, the requisite biological expertise to review and comment upon environmental
15 documents and impacts arising from project activities, as those terms are used in the California
16 Environmental Protection Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public
17 Resources Code)." The City did not send a copy of the Notice of Intent to Adopt Mitigated

19 Guidelines §15072(a). The record does not reflect that that the City consulted with the California 18 Negative Declaration to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife as required by CEQA

20 Department of Fish and Wildlife as required by Public Resources Code § 21080.3(a)
21 27. The MND prepared by the City specifically acknowledged potentially significant
22 impacts to wildlife, including impacts to the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). The hoary bat is

24 branches, 10 to 40 feet above the ground. The MND stated: "Significant impacts to individual 23 solitary and roosts primarily in foliage of both coniferous and deciduous trees, near the ends of

25 hoary bats could occur if individual bats are roosting on the trees when the trees are cut." This
26 bat is on the California Department of Fish and Wildlife list of sensitive animals. The MND

1 proposed mitigation measures to reduce these potentially significant impacts. The California
2 Department of Fish and Wildlife is a trustee agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural
3 resources (in this case wildlife) that the Project will admittedly effect.

4 28. The MND also acknowledged potentially significant impacts to native trees,
5 including the Southern California Black Walnut, This native tree is assigned a California Rare
6 Plant Rank (CRPR) of 4.2 by the California Native Plant Society. The California Department of
7 Fish and Wildlife has concluded that the Southern California Black Walnut meets the
8 definition of a "rare, threatened or endangered species." CDFW has published : document
9 titled "Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to Special Status Native Plant

three of that document 10 Populations and Sensitive Nature Communities." CDFW states at page

EJJUS|!M €8E8 basis of declining trends, recent taxonomic information and other factors. The City proposed
15 mitigation measures to reduce the potentially significant environmental impacts of the removal
16 of this native tree (namely, replacement trees). The California Department of Fish and wildlife is
17 also a trustee agency with regard to designated rare or endangered native plants (such as the
18 Southern California Black Walnut. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is a trustec
19 agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural resources (in this case native plants) that the
20 Project will admittedly effect.
21 29. The City did not send copies of the proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration to
22 the State Clearinghouse for distribution to state agencies such as the California Department of
23 Fish and Wildlife who exercise jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by the Project.
24 As a result, the City violated CEQA Guidelines §15073(d) which states as follows: "Where one
or more state agencies will be a responsible agency or a trustee agency or will exercise 25

26 jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by the project, or where the project is of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 statewide, regional, or areawide environmental significance, the lead agency shall send copies of
2 the proposed negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration to the State Clearinghouse
3 for distribution to the state agencies." The City received a comment during the public comment
4 period advising the City of its failure to send the MND to the State Clearinghouse.

5 30. The City cannot claim there are no significant impacts and use that as a basis not
6 to consult or notify a trustee agency, In Gentry v. Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1387,
7  the court stated as follows: "We conclude that natural resources can be "affected by" a project,
8 and hence the lead agency may have duties toward "trustee agencies," even if the lead agency
9 believes the project will have no significant effect on the environment. This broad construction
10 of "trustee agency" serves the statutory purpose of fostering interagency consultation. Potential
11 trustee agencies should have input at an early stage in the process into the question of whether
d77 8 LLZ06 BUNS "PAE BJJYSI!ME8E8 12| the project affects resources within their jurisdiction, and hence into the very question of whether MBT |OuuByo 'dnoxe 13 they are, in fact, trustee agencies. S
14 31. Petitioner is excused from any defense of failing to exhaust administrative SII!H AUEAEE 15 remedies on the basis that the City "failed to give the notice required by law." PRC §21177(e)

16 states that the exhaustion requirement "does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance
17 with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the
18 public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project, or if the
19 public agency failed to give the notice required by law." In Fall River Wild Trout Found. v
20 County of Shasta (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 482 the court held that the individual petitioners
21 challenging a negative declaration were not barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,
22 because the Department of Fish and Game, a trustee agency, had not been given legally required
23 notice. In that case the lead agency had provided adequate notice to the public. However, the
24 court nevertheless held that members of the public did not have to exhaust their administrative
25 remedies, because the agency had not provided a notice of intent to adopt the mitigated negative
26 declaration to the Department of Fish and Game nor sent a copy of the mitigated negative

6 resulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions." Public Resource Code § 5 the

To Whom It May Concern:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICK, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Advocates for Accossible Open Space, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandute (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City") and Real Party in Interest TTLC Los Angeles - El Sereno LLC. The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City failed to comply with CEQA when adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for a proposed development project located at 2520, 2532, 2608, 2668 North Eastern Avenue and 2647, 2649, 265 l Lombardy Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90032 (*Project"),
The Advisory Agency for the City of Los Angeles adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration on or about March 3, 2020. The City filed a Notice of Determination with the County of Recorder on March 25, 2020. The Judicial Council has tolled all statutes of limitation for civil causes of action as from April 6, 2020 until 90 days after the state of emergency related to COVID-19 is lifted.
Among other things, the City failed to provide the public notice required by law pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15073(e) to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservaney, a state ageney that commented on the draft Mitigation Negative Declaration. The City also failed to sand a copy of the Mitigated Negative Declaration to the State Clearinghouse as required by Pub. Res. C. $21082.1(c)(4). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is a trustee agency that exercises jurisdiction over resources effected by the Project.
Sincerely,

damio T. Hall Anorney for Petitioner
