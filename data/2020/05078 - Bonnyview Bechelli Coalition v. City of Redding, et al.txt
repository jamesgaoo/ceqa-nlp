1 INTRODUCTION

2 By this action Plaintiff and Petitioner BONNYVIEW BECHELLI COALITION

3 (*BBC'*), an unincorporated association, challenges the May 19, 2020 final actions taken by
4 Respondent CITY OF REDDING ("City") through its City Council certifying a final

5 environmental impact report ("EIR") and approving General Plan Amendment GPA-2017-

6 00067 and Rezoning RZ-2017-00063 to change certain land use designations and regulations

7 contained in the Redding General Plan and Zoning Code to accommodate a commercial

8 development called the River Crossing Marketplace ("Project"). The Project includes a 152,000

9 sq. ft. warehouse store operated by Real Party In Interest COSTCO WHOLESALE
10 |CORPORATION (Costco"), a 30-pump gas station, and 62,000 sq. ft. of other retail and

11 service uses at the northwest corner of the South Bonnyview Road/Interstate 5 interchange.

12 BBC contends the City's actions violated the California Environmental Quality Act

13 ("CEQA"), Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq. As certified by the City, the Project's EIR fails
14 to adequately identify, evaluate, and/or require mitigation for all significant direct and

15 cumulative environmental impacts the Project will cause. As a result, there is no substantial
16 evidence in the administrative record to support the City's findings that nearly all the Project's
17 environmental impacts will be less than significant after mitigation. Instead, substantial evidence
18 shows the Project will have several significant unmitigated environmental effects that the EIR
19 either failed to identify, failed to evaluate adequately, or failed to mitigate where feasible.
20 Petitioner accordingly seeks a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1094.5 commanding the City to set aside its certification of the EIR and its

22 of the effect of the City's actions during approval of the Project. Petitioner further seeks a stay
23 the pendency of these proceedings. Finally, Petitioner seeks an award of costs and attorneys'
24 fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, together with any other relief the Court

25 deems necessary and proper.

1 JURISDICTION & VENUE

2 7. This action is brought pursuant to the writ of mandate provisions of Code of

3 Civil Procedure sections 1085, and the declaratory relief provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
4 section 1060. Venue is proper in Shasta County under Code of Civil Procedure section 395.
5 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6 8. Around 2017, Costco applied to the City for land use entitlements for the Project.

7 9. In April, 2018 the City released a Draft EIR for the Project for public review and

8 comment. Petitioner and other agencies, organizations, and individuals commented on the Draft

9 EIR. The City released a Final EIR responding to these comments in November, 2018, but did
10 not at that time take action to approve the Project.
11 10. In April, 2019 the City revised certain portions of the EIR and recirculated them
12 for further public review and comment. Petitioner and others submitted comments on these

13 recirculated materials.

14 11. In December, 2019 the City further revised portions of the EIR and recirculated
15 these for additional public review and comment. Petitioner and others again submitted
16 comments.

17 12. In March, 2020 the City released another Final EIR for the Project, responding to
18 comments received.

19 13. On April 28, 2020 the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on the

20 Final EIR and Project. Petitioner and others presented further written and oral testimony
21 objecting to the Project generally, and to the adequacy of the Final EIR in particular. Following
22 the hearing, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the Project and EIR to

23 the City Council.
24 14. On May 19, 2020 the City Council held a public hearing on the Final EIR and

25 Project. Petitioner and others again presented written and oral objections to the Project and
26 EIR. After closing the public hearing, the City Council voted to certify the Final EIR and
27 approve the Project, adopting findings of fact, a statement of overriding considerations, and a.
28 mitigation monitoring and reporting program in accordance with CEQA.

1 15. On June 4, 2020 the City posted a notice of determination with the Shasta County

2 Clerk in accordance with CEQA.

3 CLAIM FOR RELIEF

4 (Violations of CEQA)

5 16. BBC here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

6 17. At all times televant to this action the City was the "Lead Agency" responsible for
7 the review and approval of the Project under Public Resources Code section 21067.

8 18. CEQA requires public agencies to first identify the environmental effects of its
9 project or program, and then to mitigate those adverse environmental effects through the
10 imposition of feasible mitigation measures or the analysis and selection of feasible alternatives.

11 Pub. Resources Code, § 21002. CEQA requires a lead agency to establish that either: (1) impacts

12 will not have a significant effect on the environment or (2) the agency has adopted findings that
13 all significant environmental effects have been avoided or mitigated to the extent feasible, and

14 any remaining effects found to be unavoidable are acceptable due to specific overriding

15 economic, social, technological, or other benefits.

16 19. An EIR must include : finite, stable, accutate and meaningful project description.

17 14 C.C.R., § 15124. An EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions
18 in the vicinity of the project as they existed at the time the notice of preparation is published,

19 with particular focus on the regional setting. 14 C.C.R., § 15125. An EIR must identify and

20 evaluate the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of all phases of a project. 14

21 C.C.R., § 15126. The discussion must include relevant specifics of the area, the resoutces
22 involved, physical changes, alterations to ecological systems, and changes induced in population

23 distribution, population concentration, the human use of the land (including commercial and

24 residential development), health and safety problems caused by the physical changes, and other
25 aspects of the resource base such as water, historical resources, scenic quality, and public
26 services. 14 C.C.R., § 15126.2.

27 20. A lead agency must describe and evaluate feasible measures for minimizing or

28 avoiding project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment. Pub. Resources

1 Code, § 21100(b)(3); 14 C.C.R., § 15126.4. A lead agency may not improperly defer the

2 formulation of mitigation measures until a future time. 14 C.C.R., § 15126.4.
3 21. A lead agency must identify all significant effects on the environment caused by a
4 proposed project that cannot be avoided. Pub. Resources Code, § 21100(b)(2)(A). A lead agency
5 must also provide information in the record to justify rejecting mitigation measures as infeasible

6 based on economic, social, or housing reasons. 14 C.C.R., § 15131(c).

7 22. An EIR must describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the
8 location of the project, that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but

9 would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and must
10 evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. 14 C.C.R., $ 15126.6. An EIR must also

11 include sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis,

12 and comparison with the proposed project. Id.
13 23. An EIR is required to contain a statement briefly indicating the reasons for
14 determining that various effects on the environment were not significant and consequently were
15 not discussed in detail in the EIR. Pub. Resources Code, § 21100(c).

16 24. A lead agency must provide good faith, reasoned analysis in response to
17 comments on a draft EIR. 14 C.C.R., § 15088(c). The Final EIR must address recommendations
18. and objections raised in comments in detail, giving reasons why they were not accepted. Id.

19 Specific responses are required to comments raising specific questions about significant issues.
20 25. A lead agency may not approve a project for which an EIR identifies a significant
21 environmental impact unless the impact has been mitigated or avoided by changes in the

22 project, or unless the agency specifically finds that overriding benefits outweigh the significant

23 effects on the environment. Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.
24 Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Significant Impacts

25 26. The EIR for this Project fails to adequately disclose and/or evaluate all of the
26 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, including impacts on: aesthetics,
27 agricultural resources, air quality, human health, global climate change, biological resources,

28 geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and

planning, mineral resources, noise, population and housing, public services, recreation,

2 transportation and traffic, utilities, and urban decay, in violation of the information disclosure
3 provisions of CEQA.

4 27. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
5 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not

6 supported by substantial evidence in the record.

7 Failure To Require All Feasible Mitigation Measures

8 28. An EIR must describe, evaluate, and require feasible measutes for minimizing or
9 avoiding a project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment. 14 C.C.R. §
10 15126.4.

11 29. The EIR for this Project fails to describe, evaluate, and require all reasonable,

12 feasible mitigation measures for the Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, including
13 impacts on air quality, human health, global climate change, noise, transportation and traffic,
14 and urban decay.

15 30. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
16 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not
17 supported by substantial evidence in the record.
18 Failure To Respond Adequately To Comments On Draft EIR
19 31. A lead agency must evaluate comments on environmental issues received from
20 persons who reviewed a Draft EIR. during the public comment period, and must prepare a
21 written response. 14 C.C.R. § 15088(a). The written response must describe the disposition of
22 significant environmental issues raised. Id. at subd. (c). In particular, the major environmental

23 issues raised when the lead agency's position is at variance with recommendations and
24 objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail, giving reasons why specific
25 comments and suggestions were not accepted. Id. There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in
26 response; conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. Id.; see

27 Berkeley Keep Tets Over The Bay Committee v. Board of Port Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344.

1 32. The City here failed to provide a detailed, written, good faith, reasoned analysis in

2 response to comments received on the Draft and Recirculated EIR during the public comment
3 period from individuals and responsible agencies, and failed to give adequate reasons why
4 specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. Instead, the City merely gave conclusory

5 statements unsupported by factual information.

6 33. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
7 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.
8 Unsupported Findings And Statement Of Overriding Considerations
9 34. Under Public Resources Code section 21081(b), an agency may not approve a
10 project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it finds, based on substantial evidence, that
11 specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project
12 outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
13 35. The EIR for this Project identifies impacts as unavoidably significant, but the City
14 found these impacts acceptable and adopted a statement of overriding considerations.
15 36. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support the statement of
16 overriding considerations, and the statement itself is inadequately supported by findings. There
17 is substantial evidence in the record that disproves the statement.
18 37. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
19 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not
20 supported by substantial evidence in the record.
21 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

22 1. Around March 28, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the California
23 Judicial Council issued Emergency Order No. 9, tolling the statutes of limitations for civil
24 actions during the Statewide shelter-in-place order then in effect. On May 29, 2020 the Judicial
25 Council amended Emergency Order No. 9 to toll civil statutes of limitations less than 180 days,
26 including actions under CEQA, until August 3, 2020.
27 2. Thus, the 30-day limitations period for challenging the Project under Public
28 Resources Code section 21167 commenced on August 3, 2020 and will lapse on September 2,

1 2020. This action is therefore timely filed.

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 3. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Code of Civil

4 Procedure section 1094.5. BBC objected to the City's approval of the Project orally or in writing
5 prior to the close of the final public hearing on the Project. BBC and/or other organizations and
6 individuals raised or affirmed each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in

7 writing prior to the close of the final public hearing on the Project.

8 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

9 4. BBC declares that it has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

10 course of law for the improper action of the City.

11 NEWLY PRODUCED EVIDENCE

12 5. In accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(e), BBC may, prior to

13 additional relevant evidence that could not, in the or during the hearing on this petition, offer
14 exercise of reasonable diligence, have been produced at the administrative hearing.

15 ATTORNEYS FEES

16 6. BBC is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided under Code of Civil
17 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit

18 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
19 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

20 PRAYER

21 WHEREFORE, BBC prays for entry of judgment as follows:

22 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City:
23 (a) to set aside its actions taken May 19, 2020 certifying the Final EIR and approving
24 GPA-2017-00067 and RZ-2017-00063; and

25 (b) to comply fully with CEQA in any subsequent action or actions taken to approve
26 the Project;
