1 INTRODUCTION

2

3

4 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs, Central Delta Water Agency and South Delta Water

5 Agency, ("Plaintiffs") hereby allege as follows:

6 2. This civil action is brought pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act

7 (Publio Resources Code § 21000 et seq. ["CEQA")), the Delta Reform Act of 2009 (Wat. Code, §

8 85000 et seq.), the 1959 Delta Protection Act (Wat. Code, § 12200 et seq.), the 1992 Delta Protection

9 Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 29700 et seq.), the Watershed Protection Act (Wat, Code, § 11460 et

10 seq.), and the Public Trust doctrine.

11 3. Through this action Plaintiffs seek a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive

12 relief under Code of Civil Procedure sections1085, 1094.5 and 1060 and Government Code section

13 11350 directing the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") to vacate its approval of the

14 Long-Term Operation of the State Water Project ("SWP*) the ("Project"), and its March 27, 2020

15 Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for the Project, and to revise its

16 CEQA Findings in conformance with applicable law.

17 4. The SWP diverts and exports large quantities of water from its diversion facilities in the South

18 Delta that could otherwise improve in-Delta water quality and meet in-basin beneficial uses. Through

19 these facilities, the SWP delivers an annual average of 2.9 million-acre feet of water to its customers.

20 Through the Project, DWR would continue exporting significant and harmful amounts of water from

21 the Delta. The proposed operation of SWP significantly degrades water quality in the Central and

22 South Delta and in the San Francisco Bay Delta estuary, and worsens water quality in the Delta by

23 increasing salinity levels as well as the proliferation of harmful algal blooms ("HABs"). Yet DWR's

24 environmental analysis incredulously determines that the Project will not result in any significant

25 adverse environmental impacts.

2 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3

4 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1060, 1085, and

5 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public
Resources Code.

6 6. Venue for this action properly lies in Sacramento County Superior Court because
7 DWR is state agency based in Sacramento County and the Attorney General also has an office in
8 Sacramento County. (Code Civ. Proc., § 401, subd. (1).) This Petition is timely filed in accordance

9 with Public Resources Code section
10 21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA Guidelines section15112, as well as Code of Civil Procedure

11

12 section 1085 and 1094.5, and other applicable emergency orders concerning the timing of filings
during the present COVID-19 pandemic.

13 PARTIES

14

15 7. Plaintiff CENTRAL DELTA WATER AGENCY ("CDWA") is a political

16 subdivision of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the Central Delta
Water Agency Act, chapter 1133 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-1.1, et seq.), by
17 the provisions of which CDWA came into existence in January of 1974. CDWA's boundaries are
18

19 specified in Water Code Appendix section 117-9.1 and encompass approximately 120,000 acres,

20 which are located entirely within both the western portion of San Joaquin County and the

21 "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section 12220. While the lands

22 within the agency ate primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also devoted to numerous other

23 uses including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential, commercial, and institutional

24 uses. CDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to take all reasonable and lawful actions,

25 including pursuing legislative and legal action, that have for their general purpose: (1) to protect the
water supply of the lands within the agency against intrusion of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to assure the
26 lands within the agency a dependable supply of water of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and

T future needs, The agency may also. undertake activities to assist landowners and local districts within

2 the agency in reclamation and flood control matters. (See Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-4.3, subd. (b) &

3 117-4.1, subds. (a) and (b), respectively.) CDWA may assist landowners, districts, and water right

4 holders within its boundaries in the protection of their vested water rights and may represent the

5 interests of those parties in water right proceedings and related proceedings before courts of both the

6 State of California and the United States to carry out the purposes of the agency. (See Wat. Code,

7 Appendix, 117-4.2, subd. (b).) Those vested water rights include post-1914 water permits and licensesl

8 issued by the SWRCB and its predecessor agencies, overlying rights, statutory rights, contract rights,

9 riparian rights, prescriptive rights, salvage rights, rights to recycled and recaptured water, and rights to

10 artesian flow.

11 8. Plaintiff SOUTH DELTA WATER AGENCY ("SDWA") is a political subdivision

12 of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the South Delta Water Agency

13 Act, chapter 1089 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-1.1, et seq.), by the provisions of
14 which SDWA came into existence in January of 1974. SDWA's boundaries ate specified in Water

15 Code Appendix section 116-9.1 and encompass approximately 148,000 acres, which are located

16 entirely within both the south-western portion of San Joaquin County and the "Sacramento-San

agency 17 Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section 12220. While the lands within the
18 are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also devoted to numerous other uses including
19 recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential, commercial, municipal and institutional uses,

20 SDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to take all reasonable and lawful actions, including

21 pursuing legislative and legal actions, that have for their general purpose: (1) to protect the water

22 supply of the lands within the agency against intrusions of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to assure the lands

23 within the agency a dependable supply of water of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and

7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

Co Relevant Delta History

9 12. The Delta is the largest estuary on the west coast of the Americas. The Delta

10 supports some of the most productive farmland in the world, wineries and other agriculture-related

11 enterprises. Of the approximately 500,000 acres of farmland in the Delta, approximately eighty

12 percent (80%) is classified as Prime Farmland. This is the largest contiguous swath of Prime

13 Farmland in the state. The Delta also supports a substantial sports-fishing and recreation industry,

14 many cities and communities, and hundreds of aquatic and terrestrial species (many of which are
15 unique to the Delta and at risk of extinction). Rich in history and culture, the Delta is also a core a
16 component of California's water system, from which water flows to rural and urban users throughout

17 California. The Delta is a critical component of the San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary. In 1959, the

18 Legislature enacted Water Code sections 12200 through 12205. This Act, commonly referred to as the

19 Delta Protection Act of 1959 ("1959 DPA"), was enacted to retain the Delta as the common pool,

20 stating: "water surplus to the needs of the areas in which it originates is gathered in the Delta and

21 thereby provides a common source of fresh water supply for water-deficient areas." (Wat. Code, §

22 12200.) The act makes clear that "among the functions to be provided by the State Water Resources
23 Development System, in coordination with the activities of the United States in providing salinity
24 control through operation of the Central Valley Project ("CVP,") shall be the provision of salinity

25 control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta."

26 (Wat. Code, §12202.) In Water Code section 12205, the Legislature sought to ensure that the

27 7

28
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

.,
(

1

2 adequacy of the common pool for in Delta users by requiring that "the operation and management of

3 releases from storage into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of water for use outside the area in which

4 such water originates shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the

5 fulfillment of the objectives of this part." The Project is inconsistent with these objectives by seeking

6 approval to export a permanent amount of water from the Delta to the detriment of all senior water
rights holders and other beneficial uses.

7 13. The 1959 DPA has been the subject of administrative and judicial interpretation
8 making clear that there can be no export of water from the Delta unless the Delta users are first

9

10 provided salinity control and an adequate water supply. In United States vs. State Water Resources

11 Control Board (1986) 182 Cal.App.3rd 82, 139, the court determined:

12 In 1959, when the SWP was authorized, the Legislature enacted the Delta Protection Act. (Secs. 12200-12220.) The Legislature recognized the unique water problems in the Delta,

13 particularly "salinity intrusion," which mandates the need for such special legislation "for the protection, conservation, development, control and use of waters in the Delta for the public

14 good." (Sec. 12200.) The act probibits project exports from the Delta of water necessary to

15 provide water to which Delta users are "entitled" and water which is needed for salinity control and an adequate supply for Delta users. (Secs. 12202, 12203, 12204.)

16 The court further explained: "Section 12201 clarifies that an adequate water supply is a supply

17 sufficient 1) to maintain and expand agriculture, industry, urban and recreational development in the

18 Delta and 2) to provide a common source of fresh water for export to water-deficient areas, subject to

19 the provisions of the watershed and county-of-origin statutes." (182 Cal.App.3d at p. 139, fa. 37.)

20 14. DWR's December 1960 Bulletin 76 Report to the Legislature contemporaneously

21 interpreted the 1959 DPA, explaining at page 12: "In 1959 the State Legislature directed that water

22 shall not be diverted from the Delta for use elsewhere unless adequate supplies for the Delta are first

23 provided." In this same report, at page 44, referencing alternative plans for Delta facilities, DWR

24 explained: "Under any of the foregoing projects, water of very good quality would continue to be

25 supplied to about 90 percent of the Delta lowlands through existing facilities. It is estimated that the

26 mineral quality of the supplies would range between 15 to 80 parts of chlorides and between 100 and

27 350 parts of total dissolved solids per million parts water. The quality of water in the southern portion

-

1 of the Delta would be improved." As the 1959 DPA and other authority direct, the export of water

2 from the Delta was expressly conditioned on their first being provided an adequate supply for in-Delta

3 users as defined in Water Code section 12201.

4 15. In reliance on these promises, the two major water infrastructure projects that serve

5 California's water needs, the SWP and the CVP, were ultimately constructed to include major

6 diversions in the South Delta. DWR operates the SWP, which includes pumping plants, hydroelectric

7 power plants, water storage, as well as conveyance structures. SWP exports Delta water from the

8 SWP system at Clifton Court Forebay from the Harvey O, Banks pumping plant in Contra Costa

9 County. The SWP operates under long-term contracts with water contractors throughout California.

10 These water contractors, in turn, deliver water to wholesalers or retailers or deliver it directly to

11 agricultural, municipal, and industrial water users.

12 16. The CVP comprises reservoirs, power plants, and more than 500 miles of major canals

13 and aqueducts. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") operates and maintains the CVP,

14 which is generally operated as an integrated project, and coordinates operations with the SWP.

15 Reclamation has entered into approximately 250 long-term contracts with water districts, irrigation

16 districts, and others for delivery of CVP water. Reclamation exports water into the CVP system at the

17 C. W. "Bill" Jones Pumping Plant, which supplies the Delta-Mendota Canal.

18 17. The SWP and CVP water infrastructure are operated in a coordinated manner,

19 pursuant to a 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement. Joint points of diversion allow the use of one

20 project's diversion facility by the other under certain conditions. In part, both the SWP and CVP

21 water delivery systems rely on runoff and reservoir releases in areas upstream of the Delta to deliver

22 contracted water via the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers to Delta export pumps in the South Delta.

23 18. The flows of both the San Joaquin River System and the Sacramento River System

24 vary greatly from year to year and from season to season within each year. In the late summer and

25 is early fall, the flow is usually low and it rises in the winter, spring, and early summer as a result of a

26 rains and run-off from the melting snow. Sacramento River flows in the North Delta vary broadly

27 9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

( 1 -- c

H

2

3 over the course of the year from just over 10,000 cfs to over 50,000 cfs. San Joaquin River Flows at
Vernalis before flowing into the South Delta can range from 30 cfs to almost 80,000 cfs, Operation of
the state and federal pumping systems in the Delta rely on a through-Delta conveyance approach that
4 allows fresh water from the Sacramento River to freshen the Delta prior to water being exported from

5 the South Delta.

6

7 19. The lands within the boundaries of the Delta are riparian to Delta channels and the

8 Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Delta water users claim the right to the waters flowing into the

9

10 Delta from the west, including water flowing with the tides, water flowing from the Sacramento and

11 San Joaquin Rivers, and water from all other tributaries and other sources. These claims are based on
riparian rights, prescriptive rights, pre-1914 rights, salvage rights, overlying rights, statutory rights,
rights to recycled and recaptured water, rights to artesian flow and appropriative rights based on
12  applications made and permits granted. These landowners also claim vested rights in the underground

13

14

15 water supply where it is available and which is fed by the rivers, channels, canals and sloughs in the
Delta. If the surface water quality is degraded, the groundwater is also gradually degraded.
20. Dams and diversions on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries
16 decrease flows entering the Delta, which adversely affects in-Delta quality by, among other things,

17

18

19 reducing net flows in Delta channels. Changes in the flows in the rivers, channels, canals and sloughs
in or tributary to the Delta have a material effect on the farming operations conducted on the lands

20 and other beneficial uses may become degraded because of: (1) the poor-quality drainage water from

21 irrigated from these sources. At times of low flows, the source of water used for irrigation, domestic

22

23 lands lying upstream, particularly on the San Joaquin River; and (2) the incursion of salt water from
San Francisco Bay. At such times, poor quality causes reduction in crop yields and values, and
increases irrigation costs,

24

25 21. The operation of the CVP and SWP causes other adverse effects in the South Delta.

26

27 The operation of the CVP and SWP export pumps, if not carefully controlled, substantially decreases

28 the height of water levels in the South Delta, especially the low tide level, to the point where local

10

*rah,
( . c

1

2

3 siphons and pumps cannot operate properly. The operation of the CVP and SWP export facilities also
alters the flow in the channels, creating reverse flows and stagnant zones. This results in insufficient

4 flushing of Delta waters and the concentration of all constituents, including municipal effluent and
salts from upstream return flows. In addition, such stagnation exacerbates the conditions that promote
5 proliferation of invasive water weeds and HABs such as toxic Microcystis. Delivery of Delta water to

6

7

8 the CVP's San Joaquin Valley service area results in the importation thereto of upwards of 1,000,000
tons of salt into the San Joaquin Valley, After this exported water is used, much of the salt is

9 delivered to the San Joaquin River in concentrations which exceed downstream Water Quality

10 Objectives. This drainage also includes high levels of other constituents such as selenium and boron.

11 22. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") issued a Biological Opinion (2008

12 were likely to jeopardize the continued existence of Delta smelt. As one measure to avoid jeopardy to

13 FWS BO") concluding that the effects of the proposed long-term operations of the SWP and CVP

14

15 Delta smelt and adverse modification of its critical habitat, the 2008 FWS BO required the creation of
8,000 acres of tidal habitat restoration by the SWP contractors.
23. In 2009, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries ("NOAA
16 Fisheries") issued a biological opinion ("BO") (*2009 NOAA BO") concluding that the effects of

17

19 proposed long-term SWP and CVP operations were likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the
18 Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon, Central
Valley steelhead, and Southern Distinct Population Segment of North American green sturgeon. To
20 avoid jeopardy and adverse modification of critical babitat, the 2009 NOAA BO additionally required

21

22

23 the creation of 17,000+ acres of enhanced floodplain habitat by the SWP and the CVP contractors.
24. In 2009, the California Legislature passed the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act

24 of 2009 (*2009 DRA") (Wat. Code, § 85000 et seq.) The 2009 DRA aptly describes the Delta as "a
critically important natural resource for California and the nation," which "serves Californians
25 concurrently as both the hub of the California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland

26

27 ecosystem on the west coast of North and South America." (Wat. Code, § 85002.)

28 11

( t e

2 25. In the intervening years following the 2008-2009 Biological Opinions' initially-required

3 creation of 28,000 acres of habitat, very few acres of habitat were actually created. According to the

4 Fish Restoration Program Annual Reports, however, very little of the required habitat pursuant to the

5 2008-2009 Biological Opinions has actually been completed in the Delta. Meanwhile, special status

6 species continue to decline, with Delta smelt and several salmon runs teetering on the brink of

extinction.

7

8 In 2016 the SWRCB released its Substitute Environmental Document ("SED"), the equivalent

9 of a CEQA document, for the Water Quality Control Plan ("WQCP") updates related to San Joaquin

10 River Flows and Southern Delta Water Quality, In the SED, the SWRCB proposed to relax the South

11 Dolta Salinity Objective, which would allow higher salinity in the surface waters and would impair
South Delta agriculture. The SED provided no scientific justification for the increase in salinity, but
12 | instead relied on the fact that increasing permissible levels of salinity in South Delta water would

13

14 result in fewer violations of the standard. In late 2018, the SWRCB adopted the SED thereby relating
the South Delta salinity standard to 1.0 IEC year-round,

15

16 California Environmental Quality Act

17 26.CEQA has two purposes: environmental protection and informed self-government.

18 CEQA must "be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the

19 reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Comm 'n.
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) CEQA requires agencies to "take all action necessary to protect,
20 rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001,

21 subd. (a).)

22 27.Under CEQA, a "project" is an activity which may

23 cause either direct physical

24 change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
(Pub. Resources Code, § 21065, subd. (a)); and a "discretionary" project is one that is subject to
25 judgmental controls, where the agency can use its judgment to decide whether and how to carry out a
26 project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15002, subd, (i).) Prior to approving

27 12

2 a discretionary project, an agency must fully disclose and analyze all of the project's potentially

3 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. (See, e.g., CEQA Guidelines, §

4 15002, subd. (f).) Public agencies must avoid or minimize such environmental damage where

5 feasible. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15021, subd. (a).) Pursuant to this duty, no public agency may

6 approve or carry out a project where one or more significant effects on the environment may occur if

7 the project is approved, unless certain narrow findings are made. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091,
15093.)

8

9 Legislative Protections for the Deita

10 28. Over the course of California's water development history, the Legislature has

11 enacted measures to protect the Delta and other areas in which water serving other parts of the states
originates.

12

13 29. The 1959 DPA: (1) requires the SWP and CVP to provide salinity control and an

14 adequate water supply for the Delta (Wat. Code, §§ 12201, 12202); (2) prohibits the export of water

15

16 from the Delta to which in-Delta users are entitled through water rights and water, which is necessary
for salinity control and an adequate supply "to maintain and expand agriculture, industry, urban and

17

18 recreational development in the Delta" (Wat, Code, § 12204); (3) requires maintenance of a "common

19 source of fresh water" in the Delta to serve both in-Delta water needs and export water needs when

2 43. DWR prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. DWR did not proceed in the

3 manner required by law, and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying the EIR. are not

4 supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.)

5 44. A court evaluating an agency's procedural compliance "determine[s] de novo whether the

6 agency has employed the correct procedures, scrupulously enforcing all legislatively mandated CEQA
7 requirements." (Citizens for a Sustainable Treasure Island v. City and County of San Francisco

8 (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1045.) "[T]he existence of substantial evidence supporting the agency's

10 disclosure provisions." (Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184

12 45. The project objectives must illuminate all elements of the project's underlying

13 purpose. (Habitat & Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1300.)
14 However, project objectives must not be SO narrowly defined that they preclude consideration of
15 reasonable alternatives for achieving the project's underlying purpose. (North Coast Rivers Alliance v.
16 Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668.) CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project

17 description and fully disclose and fairly evaluate the nature and objective of a project. (San Joaquin

18 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR must contain a

19 "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which enables them to
20 make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." (CEQA

21 Guidelines, § 15151.)

22 DWR Failed to Utilize a Stable Project Description as CEQA Requires

23 46. CEQA requires DWR to provide a clear description of the Project under consideration. "An

24 accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally

25 sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo, 71 Cal.app.3d at 193; Concerned Citizen's of Costa Mesa, Inc., 42

1 47. Instead, the DEIR states:

2 The Proposed Project, which is the preferred alternative in the [DEIR], consists of

3 multiple elements that characterize future operations of SWP facilities, modify ongoing programs being implemented as part of SWP operations, improve specific activities that would

4 enhance protection of special-status fish species, or support ongoing studies and research on these special-status species to improve the basis of knowledge and management of these
5 species. Implementation of these elements is intended to continue operation of the SEP and deliver up to the full contracted water amounts while minimizing and fully mitigating the take
6 of listed species consistent with CESA requirements.

7 (DEIR 3-15; see also FEIR III.3-16.) The DEIR includes brief descriptions of various elements of the

8 Proposed Project. (DEIR, 3-15 to 3-17; FEIR, III.3-16 to III.3-19.) Yet this discussion lacks
9 sufficient clarity and detail to inform the reader regarding what DWR proposed to do. The alternatives
10

11 to the Proposed Project were described in similarly vague and obfuscatory ways. (FEIR, III.5-1.)

12 48. Only after circulating the DEIR. did DWR provide a description of what the Proposed Project

13 was intended to accomplish. (FEIR, II.3-16.) DWR's changes to the description of the Proposed

14 Project include a belated disclosure of its planned duration. (Ibid.) By failing to provide a stable and

15 finite description of the Project, DWR violated CEQA.
16 49. The Project, as approved, is not described in the DEIR, DWR developed Refined Alternative
17 2B after it circulated the DEIR. (FEIR, I-1.) Thus, the FEIR includes entirely new analysis and
18

19 discussion that was not provided to the public for review and comment before approval. (FEIR III.5-

20 38 to III.5-285.) The EIR.'s Project description describes Project elements in such indefinite terms, or

21 omits descriptions entirely, that the EIR lacks a Project description that permits analysis of Project

22 impacts at a "project" level. DWR's description of the Project was not sufficient to inform the public
23 of the Project that it approved.

DWR Failed to Provide a Clear Discussion of the Project's Purpose and Objectives 2

3 50. CEQA requires that EIR include "[a] statement of the objectives sought by the proposed

4 project...The statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project and may

5 discuss the project benefits." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124, subd. (b).) "[A] lead agency may not give

6 a project's purpose an artificially narrow definition." North Coast Rivers Alliance, 243 Cal.App4th at
7 668.
8 51. Here, the EIR includes impermissibly narrow Project objectives. In addition, DWR did not

10 provide a statement regarding the underlying purpose of the Project until it published its Final EIR the

11 same day it approved the Project. (FEIR, II.6.5-16.) In its NOP and DEIR, DWR stated that:

12 The objective of the Proposed Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to 13 store, divert, and convey water in accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver

14 water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full contract quantities. DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife
15 based on the best available scientific information.

16 (NOP DEIR, 3-1.) It was only after DWR circulated the DEIR for public comment that it created a

17 statement of the underlying purpose of the Project:
18 The underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain incidental take authorization
19 from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act to allow DWR to continue the long-term operation of the SWP
20 consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements.

21 (FEIR I.6.5-15.) Thus, DWR failed to provide the public with a clear explanation of what DWR
22 intended the Project to do, and why. But by delaying the formulation of the statement of underlying
23 purpose until after the conclusion of the environmental review process, DWR improperly curtailed
24

25 informed publio participation. Without a clear statement of the underlying goals of the Project, DWR

P frustrated the formulation and discussion of reasonable alternatives to the Project, and the public's

2 ability to weigh in regarding the same.
3 52. The Project purpose is misleading thereby frustrating a fundamental requirement of CEQA.
4
DWR. At the time the comments to the DEIR were due DWR's website stated that the Project does not
5

6 seek to increase SWP exports. Yet, page 3-18 of the DEIR provides that, DWR, in coordination with

7 Reclamation, proposes to operate the SWP in a manner that maximizes exports while minimizing

8 direct and indirect impacts on state and federally listed species. The EIR provides that the Project

9 could result in an increase 219 Thousand Acre Feet which is a 6 percent increase compared to existing

10 conditions. According to the EIR, relative delivery increases would be greatest in above-normal,
11 below normal, and dry years. In dry and critical water years, proposed long-term average annual SWP
12

13 deliveries would increase by 193 Thousand Acre Feet which is an 8 percent increase over existing

14 conditions. The EIR's failure to clearly disclose the purpose of the Project renders it inadequate.

15 The EIR Fails to Appropriately Address the Coordinated Operations Agreement Amendment

16 53. Despite its commitment in its NOP that the EIR would evaluate the impacts associated with the

17 COA Addendum, DWR failed to provide an adequate and transparent analysis of the COA Addendum

18 in the EIR. Instead, DWR incorporated the COA Addendum's changes to SWP operations into the
19

20 environmental baseline for the Project. And while DWR presents modeling that compares the COA

21 Addendum and the 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement, it does not address how the Project's

22 impacts would differ with (or without) the COA Addendum. , DWR's hyperlink to complete CalSim

23 TI model output for the2018 COA Addendum and 1986 COA Studies did not provide the public with

24 the promised information.

25 54. In Section 2.1 of the EIR, DWR is described as the lead agency for the Long-Term
26 Operation of the CVP and SWP. The joint operations of the SWP and the CVP are governed and

1 inextricably linked through the Coordinated Operations Agreement. NEPA requires full and complete

2 disclosure of potential major action proposed by or significantly involving federal agencies. The EIR

5

6 fails to foster informed decision making and public participation, contrary to CEQA's informationall

7 mandates.

8 The EIR Fails to Disclose and Analyze the Project's Impacts

9 56. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a proposed

10 project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential alternatives to
11 the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter alia, all of
12

13 the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and potential

14 mitigation measures. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100, subd. (b).).

15 57. The EIR fails to disclose the impacts of the Project in numerous ways. DWR fails to

16 adequately discuss the Project's impacts on salinity levels in the South Delta. The SWP and the CVP

17 continue to violate South Delta salinity standards for beneficial agricultural uses. These violations

18 have never been enforced by the SWRCB. Although the DEIR states that the State Water Project will
19 operate in compliance with the current regulatory framework, DWR has a history of failing to comply
20

21 with Southern Delta Water Quality Standards for Agricultural Beneficial Uses ("Salinity Standards.")

22 Notwithstanding DWR's assertions on page 4-28 of the DEIR, DWR. and the United States Bureau of

23 Reclamation ("USBR") are obligated to meet the Salinity Standards. DWR and USBR have gone

24 through two hearings before the State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") regarding

25 compliance with the Salinity Standards resulting in two Cease and Desist Orders. The first resulted in
26 Water Right Order 2006-0006 and the second in Water Right Order 2010-0002.
27 20

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

C -

1 On pages 20 to 22 of WRO 2010-0002 the SWRCB requires DWR and USBR to submit plan

2 to "obviate" the threats of non-compliance with the Salinity Standards, which are obligations of DWR
and USBR. That plan was due 180 days after the SWRCB completed a process to consider changes to
4
the Salinity Standards. The Order further provided that if any such changes were not completed or
5

6 changes were adopted but the water rights process to implement those changes was not completed or

7 initiated before January 1, 2013, such a water right proceeding would be deemed complete. No such
8 changes were adopted before the January 1, 2013 deadline and a water rights process was not initiated

9 or completed by that date. Accordingly, at minimum, DWR and USBR were required to submit a plan
10 ago, No such plan was ever presented by which they would meet the Salinity Standards seven years
11 and DWR and USBR have been and are in violation of Cease and desist Order WRO 2010-0002.
12 Said violations are relevant to the EIR because the Salinity Standards are commonly violated.
13

14 Hence, DWR's assertions in the DEIR that it will operate to meet D-1641 is unreliable. DWR claims

15 it is operating according to D-1641 when in fact it is violating D-1641 which imposes permit

16 conditions on DWR and USBR. As such, the EIR's impact analysis is based on significantly incorrect
17| understanding of DWR's current operations thereby rendering the EIR. inadequate. Further, DWR's
18 relies on compliance with D-1641 as a primary mitigation measure to offset the Project's impacts.
19 There is significant evidence in the record, and historically, that compliance with D-1641 does not
20

21 mitigate the impacts Delta water quality. DWR's reliance on D-1641 renders the EIR inadequate.

22 58. DWR asserts that south delta salinity is a function of San Joaquin River flows and that it has

23 informed the State Water Resources Control Board (*SWRCB") that violations of the Salinity
24 Standards are beyond its and USBR's "reasonable control." (EIR p. 4-28) Such self-serving
25 statements do not change the fact that compliance with the Salinity Standards are a condition of
26 DWR's permit to divert water from the Delta. There is no middle ground where DWR can assert it is

2 not responsible for an obligation imposed upon it during the water rights proceeding which led to D-

3

4 1641. Consistent with its assertion that it not capable, and therefore, not required to meet the Salinity

Standards, the DEIR fails to examine the impacts from DWR's violations of said Standards. This

6 omission renders the impacts analysis fatally flawed and not supported by substantial evidence.

7 59. The EIR fails to adequately address and consider the significant lowering of water levels in the

8 South Delta as a result of the Project's operations.

9 60, The EIR is inadequate because DWR has failed to conduct a water availability analysis and

10

11 because the permits governing operation of the S'WP have expired. The EIR also fails to address the

12 fact the Permit Applications associated with the State Water Project ("SWP") expired before the

13 project was completed, Although DWR untimely applied to renew its Applications, no action has

14 been taken on same. As such, no lawful permit exists to allow operation of the SWP thereby rendering
the DEIR premature and irrelevant.

15 61. The DEIR describes the elements of the preferred alternative in Table 1-1 a. It lists a minimum
16 export pumping amount of no less than 1,500 cfs (combined CVP and SWP) even during drought.

17

18

19 is This number is greater than the SWP and CVP were able to export during the recent drought. Such a

20 minimum is purported to be for the protection of health and safety, but there is no evidence of that

21 need contained in the EIR, thereby rendering the document fundamentally flawed and not supported

by substantial evidence.

22

23 62. The EIR fails to consider the fundamental basis for the current and future operations of the

24 State Water Project (*SWP") by ignoring the glaring fact that there is abundant and overwhelming

25

26 evidence demonstrating there is not enough surplus water in the system most years to satisfy the intent

27 of the Project. Therefore, a comprehensive water availability analysis should be conducted as a

28 precondition to determining if desired exports can be achieved. The EIR avoids this analysis by
22

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

c

1 relying on "assumptions" contained within its models. Such assumptions do not reflect senior water
2 rights or regulatory obligations and, instead, attempt to "balance" the junior water rights of exporters

3 with the senior water rights of other users and of the environment/public trust.
4 63. To address this shortage, the SWP was supposed to develop water supplies from various north
5

6 coast rivers to add 5 million-acre feet of water to the Sacramento system in each and every year (see

7 Bulletin 76 chart attached). Said water was supposed to be added to the system by the year 2000. This

8 did not happen. The Until this fundamental supply issue is analyzed, updated and applied, no

9 environmental review of SWP operations is valid.

10 64. The EIR relies on modeling for its analysis of impacts but that analysis is not accurate and
11 therefore not the best available science, The EIR goes to great lengths to explain why the CalSim II
12

13 and DSM2 models are useful tools in conducting an impacts analysis while at the same time

14 cautioning that the models cannot be used to determine the specific impacts/effects from the Project

15 over time periods shorter than one month. The EIR asserts that the modeling results can only be used

16 to show comparisons of different scenarios and long-term trends. This is the same untenable position
17 DWR. took. in the WaterFix proceedings. More specifically, DWR asserts that because the CalSim II

18 model generates monthly data, which is then used as inputs to the DSM2 model, the models cannot be
19 used to predict actual conditions or actual impacts. Further, the EIR takes the implausible position that
20

21 since the model may be unable to consistently preform as designed, any output that shows a 5% or lessl

22 change should be disregarded as a modeling error. There is no basis for DWR's conclusions. As such

23 the EIR fundamentally inadequate.

24 65. The EIR. improperly minimizes the significant adverse impacts from increases in
25 methylmercury concentration from the creation of habitat purportedly beneficial to fish species in the
26 Delta, This impact must be fully analyzed.
27 23

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

2 66. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and mitigate the increase in toxic algal blooms

3 and Microcystis in the Delta resulting from the operation of the Project which are a significant health

4 hazard to recreational users, animals, and fish. The continued and increase level of export from the

Delta will increase such impacts,
67. DWR improperly limited to the Project area to include only "the SWP Service Areas and
7 Existing SWP storage and export facilities located within the Delta and vicinity." (FEIR, III.3-1.)

9 DWR included only the areas receiving Project benefits, and excluded areas the Project would harm.

10 Equally improper, it excluded the related CVP facilities from the Project Area, as well as DWR

11 facilities upstream of the Delta. (FEIR, III.1-4, III.3-1.) Thus, despite the interrelated nature of their

12 SWP and CVP operations, and the manner in which each water project alters the conditions for the

13 other, the DWR's Project Area excludes watersheds and water facilities that would face changed

14 environmental conditions due to DWR's Project operation. In so doing, DWR avoided disclosing
15 potentially significant impacts that would occur due to the Project's implementation, including impacts
16

17 surrounding the operation of Oroville Reservoir and the Trinity River System, and all CVP water

18 sources that would be primarily under the control of the Bureau including the Trinity, Sacramento and

19 American rivers. This failure led DWR to omit discussions of the impacts to fisheries resources

20 upstream of the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento River, including in the Trinity River, even

21 when the Project may impact flow and temperature in these waterways. This violates CEQA. (See
22 Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2013) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 870-872
23 [impacts on interconnected waterways must be examined in EIR].)
24

25 68. DWR's FEIR disclaims any need to study impacts caused by its Project upstream of the

26 confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers because, it argues, DWR has limited ability to take

27 24

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

{ ( e

1 action to mitigate those effects. But this does not excuse DWR's failure to disclose these impacts.

2 CEQA required DWR to do so. Were DWR to have determined that appropriate mitigation measures
3 exist but are outside its jurisdiction to mandate, it was required to make finding that indicate that
4 "those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency
5
and have been, or can and should bo, adopted by that other agency." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, 6

7 subd. (a)(2).) DWR was not authorized to ignore potentially feasible mitigation measures for
8 significant impacts simply because other agencies may be required to implement them. (Habitat and

9 Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304-1305; City of San Diego V.

10 Board of Trustees of California State University (2015) 61 Cal.4th 945, 957.)
11 69. The FEIR improperly concludes that the Project will not have water quality impacts from
12

13 proposed fall pulse flows of agricultural drain water. (FEIR, 11.6.5-19 to 11.6.5-20.) DWR instead

14 claims that the timing of these flows will prevent the introduction of pollutants, or that the use of these

15 flows will be "adaptively managed" to avoid water quality impacts. (Ibid.) Neither
16 position is based on science, let alone actual empirical evidence. "An EIR must focus on impacts to

17 the existing environment, not hypothetical situations." (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Waterl

18 Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 955.) The Project's fall pulse flows of agricultural drain water
19 would be composed of available drainage water from rice fields discharged at the end of the growing
20

21 season. (FEIR, III.3-32 to III.3-33, III.5-57 to III.5-58 [use of fall pulse flows under Refined

22 Alternative 2B1.) The FEIR concedes that "mercury methylation can occur when lands are flooded,

23 such as…for rice production." (FEIR, 11.6.5-19.] Yet the FEIR inexplicably - and falsely -- claims

24 that the use of water that will be drained from rice fields would not introduce additional contaminants.

25 (Ibid.) DWR's discussion and analysis of this impact fails to foster informed decision making.

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

..4 (

1 70. By improperly conflating its discussion of the Project's impacts with its discussion of

2 measures designed to minimize those impacts, DWR has prevented the public from understanding the
3 scope and severity of those impacts and subsequently, the efficacy of the
4 mitigation measures that the DWR improperly presumed would reduce those impacts to insignificance,
5

6 The distinction is not one of semantics, but instead of purpose and effect. (Lotus v. Dep't of

7 Transportation (2014) 223 Cal,App.4th 645, 655-656, 656 n. 8 [discussing the distinction between

8 measures that are part of the project, such as paving mixes, from measures that are "plainly mitigation

9 measures," such as restorative planting]).

10 The DEIR also fails to analyze the impacts that SWP operations have on agriculture in the
11 Delta. These impacts can ocour from changes in water quality as well as other physical changes, such
12

13 as placement of batriers and changes in flow patterns. Agriculture in the Delta depends

14 on an adequate supply of high-quality water, which the Project would negatively impact. The DEIR's

15 reliance on real time operations to allegedly avoid increases in salinity, including violations of D-

16 1641, is inadequate to avoid these impacts.

17 DWR Failed Include an Adequate Discussion of Alternatives

18 71. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even if
19 they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

5 73. The FEIR's presentation of the Project's alternatives fails to foster informed decision making,

6 In addressing the Project and the alternatives thereto, DWR failed to detail how each alternative

7 compare to the Proposed Project. For example, the No Project Alternative discussion simply states

8 that it does not include the Proposed Project's actions, and refers the reader to the DEIR's discussion

9

10 of the existing environmental conditions. (FEIR, III.5-1 to 5-5.) Only in updating the analysis to

11 include Refined Alternative 2B did DWR provide any level of detailed analysis that might allow the

12 public to contrast the options under consideration. (FEIR, III.5-38 to III.5-285.) And this information

13 was only made available to the public after DWR approved the Project. The discussion of the other

14 alternatives provides some additional information, but continues to obfuscate the differences between

15 the various alternatives. (FEIR, III.5-6 to III.5-38 [discussing Alternative 2A], III.5-286 to III.5-329

16 [discussing Alternatives 3 and 4].) For example, the FEIR's discussion of Alternative 4 indicates that

17

18 it would replace summer and fall actions of the Proposed Project to add additional Delta Smelt habitat

19 criteria. (FEIR. III.5-301.) The FEIR indicates that this change may require "additional outflow"

20 which would be provided through "some combinations of' (1) "SWP and CVP export reductions" (2)

21 increased releases from Oroville Reservoir, or (3) "[w]ater purchases from other water users." (FEIR.

22 III.5-301 to III.5.302.) But, as with its discussion of the Proposed Project, the FEIR fails to examine

23 the impacts of these changes throughout the impacted watershed. And, because DWR excluded

24 Oroville Reservoir and the Feather River from its analysis, the FEIR lacks the information necessary
to understand the impacts of Alternative 4 as compared to the No Project Alternative or the Proposed
25 Project. (FEIR INI.5-316 [discussing impacts upstream of the Delta for Alternative 4].)

1 The DEIR Fails to Disclose the Project's Cumulative Impacts

2 74. Under CEQA Guidelines section 15130, subdivision (b)(1), the cumulative

3 projects list should include "past, present, and probable future projects producing related
4 or cumulative impacts." Here, the Draft EIR fails to list a Delta Water Tunnel project as

a
6 related project. (Draft EIR, Table 4.6-1.) This omission is despite the fact that the

7 DEIR relies heavily on documents associated with the now withdrawn California WaterFix Two
Tunnels project. (See DEIR, Chapter 6 [References].) In addition, the discussion of cumulative

9 projects that are included in the DEIR is extremely cursory and fails to inform the public about how

10 the project would interact with related projects including but not limited to the Portfolio Plan of which
11 the hallmark is a further rendition of isolated conveyance to bypass the Delta. As such, the EIR is
12
inadequate.
13

14 DWR Fails to Discuss Inconsistencies Between the Project and the Applicable Delta Plan

15 75. CEQA requires that the EIR "discuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and
16 applicable…regional plans" such as the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan. (CEQA Guidelines,

17 § 15125, subd. (d).) Despite this requirement, DWR failed to include such a discussion in the FEIR,
18 on the mistaken premise that the Delta Plan does not apply to the Project. DWR's failure to include
19 this analysis violates CEQA.
20 DWR Should Have Recirculated the DEIR
21

22 76. CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a) requires agencies "to recirculate an EIR

23 when significant new information is added to the EIR after public notice is give n of the availability of

24 the draft EIR…but before certification." New information is deemed "significant" where "the EIR is

25 changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon [1] a
26

...

1 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or [2] a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such

2 an effect…that the project's proponents have declined to implement." (Ibid.)
3 77. Here, DWR made substantial changes to the EIR after circulating the DEIR. The FEIR
4
includes 247 new pages of analysis of the impacts of Refined Alternative 2B alone. (FEIR II.5-38 to
5

6 FEIR III.5-285.) This substantial addition of this Project Alternative in the FEIR precluded public

7 comment on the Project that DWR approved, including the ability to comment on the additional

8 impacts that Refined Alternative 2B may have on the environment.

9 78. Likewise DWR's significant alteration of the Project's fundamental purpose in the FEIR

10 precluded public participation and requires recirculation.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
13 (VIOLATIONS OF THE 2009 DELTA REFORM ACT
14 PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 29700 ET SEQ.)

15

16 79. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

17 Paragraphs 1 through 78 as though fully set forth herein.

18 80. The 2009 DRA provides comprehensive protections for the Delta. As with the

19 other acts, DWR's approval of the Project and its certification of the EIR violate the 2009 Delta

20 Reform Act in numerous substantial respects.

21 81. The 2009 DRA sets out numerous policies of the State of California that apply to

22 the management of the Delta, These policies constitute the "coequal goals" of the 2009 Delta Reform

23 Act, and are generally applicable provisions of the Water Code,

24 The 2009 DRA also directs the Delta Stewardship Council ("Council") to adopt a Delta Plan

25 for long-term management of the Delta. The Delta Plan is the mechanism by which the Council may

26 reviews covered actions. (See Wat. Code, § 85059.) The Council evaluates covered actions for

3 consistency with the Delta Plan when a party challenges an agency's certification of consistency,

4 (Wat. Code, §85225.10.) This review process pertains specifically to the Delta Plan and is separate
from the 2009 DRA's policies.

5 82. The 2009 DRA defines the coequal goals of Delta water management as "the two

6

7 goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing
the Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals shall be achieved in a manner that protects and enhances the

9 unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta as an evolving

10 | place." (Wat. Code, § 85054.) As the policies of the State of California, the coequal goals apply

11 generally to the Project and are not exclusively the purview of the Council. The coequal goals are

12 judicially enforceable. (See e.g., Klajic, supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 995; Pomona Police, supra, 58
Cal.App.4th at 584.)

13 83. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR conflict directly with
the 2009 DRA's mandate of reducing reliance on the Delta. No water availability analysis has been
14 performed to determine the Project's impacts to water supply; had a water availability analysis been
15 performed, it would have disclosed the fact that the Project relies on "paper water," i.e., water that
16 exists only on paper.

17 84. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR also violate the 2009
18 DRA's co-equal goal of protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The Project
19 impermissibly continues with the recent and unsustainable levels it exports from the Delta.

20

21 85. DWR's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR also conflict directly

22

23 with the 2009 DRA's requirement that Delta water be managed in a manner that protects and enhances

24 the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta. (Wat. Code, §

25 85054.) The Project will continue to cripple the Delta's sustainable and wildlife-friendly agricultural
operations, and destroy special status species Delta habitat.

26

27

28 30

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 86. "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

2 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional

3 supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency." (Wat. Code, § 85021.) The Project directly

4 conflicts with the policy of reduced reliance because it would continue the practice of exporting

5 growth inducing water supplies from the Delta that increase-rather than decrease-teliance on the

6 Delta to meet present and future water supply needs outside the Delta,

7 87. • In the 2009 DRA, the Legislature declared State policy, in pertinent part, as
8 follows: "The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting
California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional

10 supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency . . .." (Wat. Code, § 85021.) The Project does

11 precisely the opposite.

12 88. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered
to whether the 13 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed finding as

14 covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta

15 Stewardship Council. Water Code § 85225.

16 89. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project' as defined

17 by PRC section 21065 that:

18 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun March.

19 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or local public agency.

20 (3)Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan,

21 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal goals or the

22 implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to
people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

23

24 (Wat. Code, § 85057.5, subd. (a).) The Project meets these criteria, and is therefore a covered action.

25 While the Delta Reform Act states that "[r]outine maintenance and operation of the State Water

26

27 31

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injuuctive Relief

-

- Project is not a covered action," the Project does not qualify for that exemption because it is neither

2 routine maintenance nor routine operation of the SWP. (Water Code, § 85057.5, subd. (b).)
90. DWR denies that the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act. (FEIR II.17-6.)

4 But Water Code section 85057.5, subdivision (b)'s exemption of "[r]outine maintenance and operation

5 of the State Water Project" from the definition of covered action cannot apply to this Project, which
6 encompasses changes to the operation of the SWP to comply with the California Department of Fish

7 and Wildlife's Incidental Take Permit requirements. Such changes are more that simple "routine
operation."
The Project also fails to comply with WR. P1 Reduce Reliance on the Delta through

10 Improved Regional Water Self-Reliance (23 § Cal. Code regs, § 5003) applies to this project.
11

12 Yet the Draft EIR makes no mention of compliance with this state policy, as implemented by

13 the Delta Stewardship Council. (See Wat. Code, § 85021.) The SWP (directly and through

14 its contractors) is required to take steps to reduce reliance on the Delta.

15 In addition, the adaptive management description and other references to adaptive
16 management in the DEIR fail to refer to Adaptive Management as defined in the Delta Plan. (See 23
17

18 Cal. Code Regs., Appendix 1B.) Adaptive management is defined in the Delta Plan as "a framework

19 and flexible decision-making process for ongoing knowledge acquisition, monitoring, and evaluation

20 leading to continuous improvement in management planning and implementation of a project to

21 achieve specified objectives."

22 91. Because the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve

23 the Project without first making a determination of consistency with the Delta Plan. (Wat. Code,

24 85225.) And because approval of the Project continues DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without

25 any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the Delta Reform Act's coequal goals, including the

26

27 32

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

( .. (

1

2 requirement to reduce reliance on the Delta for water supplies, the Project is inherently inconsistent
with both the 2009 Delta Reform Act and the Delta Plan.

3

4 92. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed
findings as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta
Reform Act, its approval must be set aside. (Wat. Code, 85225.)
93. For the foregoing reasons, DWR failed to act in the manner required by law and
7 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project and certifying the EIR,

9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (VIOLATIONS OF THE 1959 DELTA PROTECTION ACT

11 WATER CODE SECTION 12200 ET SEQ.)

12

13 94, Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1
through 93 as though fully set forth herein.

14 95. In 1959, the Legislature found and declared that:

15

16 [Tjhe maintenance of an adequate water supply in the Delta sufficient to maintain and expand agriculture, industry, urban, and recreational development in the Delta .. . and

17 to provide a common source of fresh water for export to areas of water deficiency is necessary to the peace, health, safety and welfare of the people of the State . .. .

18

19 (Wat. Code, § 12201, emphasis added.) Providing that "common source of fresh water" within the

20 Delta for both water users within and outside of the Delta is not optional for DWR. Water Code
section 12205 provides:
21

22

23 It is the policy of the State that the operation and management of releases from storage into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of water for use outside the area in which such

24 water originates shall be integrated to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objectives of this part.

25

26 (Emphasis added; see also, Wat, Code, § 107 ["all . . , declarations of policy in this [Water]

27 code shall be given their full force and effect"].)
33

28 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

•** (

1

2 96. Because one "of the objectives of this part" is the provision of a "common source of fresh

3 water" within the Delta for water users both within and outside of the Delta, DWR has a mandatory

4 duty to integrate its "releases from storage into the [Delta] of water for use outside the area in which
such water originates . to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of [that]
objective[]." (Wat. Code, §§ 12201 & 12205.)

6

77 97. Additional objectives of the 1959 DPA include "the provision of salinity control and an

8 adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." (Wat. Code, § 12202; see also, Wat.
Code, § 12201.)

9

10 98. Under Water Code section 12205, DWR therefore has an additional duty to integrate its

11 "releases from storage into the [Delta] of water for use outside the area in which such water originates

12 to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objectives" of providing

13 that "salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." (Wat. Code,

14 § 12202.) The Project fails to comply with the Delta Protection Act by failing to provide necessary
fresh water flows to protect Delta Water Quality.

15

16 99. The failure to provide for Delta salinity control constitutes a direct violation of DWR's

17 duty in Water Code section 12205 to "integrate its releases of storage water into the Delta for export

18 from the Delta] to the maximum extent possible in order to permit the fulfillment of the objectives" of

19 providing "salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." (Wat.

20 Code, § 12202.) For this reason, also, the Project, as proposed, fails as a matter of law and cannot be
allowed to proceed.

21

22 100. Additionally, the Project, as proposed, violates DWR's duties under Water Code
section 12204, which provides:

23

24 In determining the availability of water for export from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta no water shall be exported which is necessary to meet the requirements of Sections 12202 and 12203 of this chapter.
25

26

td --** (*

1 101. Water Code section 12202, as discussed, requires DWR to provide "salinity control

2 and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the [Delta]." Water Code section 12204,

3 accordingly, prohibits DWR from exporting water that is necessary to provide salinity control and an

4 adequate water supply.

5 102. Notwithstanding that duty, the Project will continue to violate that duty by exporting

6 that is needed to provide that salinity control and an adequate water supply for the Delta.

8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (VIOLATIONS OF THE 1992 DELTA PROTECTION ACT
PÜBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 29700 ET SEQ.)
10

11 103. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1

12 through 102 as though fully set forth herein,

13 104. In the 1992 DPA, the Legislature makes numerous findings and declarations for the

14 protection of the Delta, including the following set forth in Public Resources Code sections 29701 and
15 29702, respectively:

16

17 "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and international significance, containing irreplaceable resources, and it is the policy of the

18 state to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. (Wat. Code, § 29701, emphasis added.)
19 "[TJhe basic goals of the state for the delta are the following: (b) Protect, maintain,
20 and, where possible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the delta environment, including, but not limited to, agriculture, wildlife habitat, and recreational activities."
21 (Wat. Code, § 29702, emphasis added.)

22 105. DWR's compliance with the policies and goals in the 1992 DPA is mandatory. (See
23 e.g., Klajic v. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 987, 995 ["The trial court reviews an
24 administrative action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 to determine [among other
25 things] whether the agency's action was. contrary to established public policy"] (Klajic).)
26 "Generally, a writ [under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085] will lie when there is no plain,

1 speedy, and adequate alternative remedy; the respondent has duty to perform; and the petitioner has

2 clear and beneficial right to performance." (Pomona Police Officers' Ass'n v. City of Pomona (1997)

3 58 Cal.App.4th 578, 584, quoting Payne v. Superior Court (1976) 17 Cal.3d 908, 925 (Pomona

4 Police).)

5 106. As is the case with the 2009 DRA, which contains substantially similar findings and
6 declarations (and which is discussed below), far from "preserv[ing]," "protect[ing]" "maintain[ing]."

7 much less "enhance[ing]" the Delta's "irreplaceable resources" and the "overall quality of the Delta

8 | environment," the EIR confirms that the Projeot's construction and operation would substantially

9 impair, and in many cases permanently destroy, those resources and qualities, in direct contravention

10 of the policies and goals set forth in the 1992 DPA.

11 107. The continued operation of the Project is also contrary to the co-equal goals set

12 forth in Public Resources Code section 29702 (which are also set forth in the 2009 DRA and also

13 discussed below). Public Resources Code section 29702, subdivision (a), provides:

14

15 The Legislature further finds and declares that the basic goals of the state for the Delta are the following: (a) Achieve the two coequal goals of providing a more reliable water
16 supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The coequal goals shall be achieved in a manner that protects and enhances the unique
17 cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta as an evolving place.
18 108. The Project's noncompliance with these co-equal goals includes the Project's failure to

19 "provid[e] a more reliable water supply for [Delta exporters]" "in a manner that protects and enhances
the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta as an evolving 20

21 place." (Pub. Resources Code, § 29702.)

1 109. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1

2 through 108 as though fully set forth herein.

3 110. Water Code section 11460 of the Watershed Protection Act provides:

4 In the construction and operation by the department [i.e., DWR and USBR] of any project under the provisions of this part a watershed or area wherein water originates, or an area 5 immediately adjacent thereto which can conveniently bo supplied with water therefrom,

6 shall not be deprived by the department directly or indirectly of the prior right to all of the water reasonably required to adequately supply the beneficial needs of the watershed, area,
7 o1 any of the inhabitants or property owners therein.

8 111. Dospite this prohibition against operating the Project in a manner that "directly or

9 indirectly" deprives the Delta of its "prior right to all of the water reasonably required to adequately

10 supply the beneficial needs of the [Delta] o1 any of the inhabitants or property owners therein," DWR
11 intends to operate the Project in a manner that does precisely that. Instances of such deprivations

12 include the continued operation of the Project to export Sacramento River fresh water away from the

13 Delta that is "reasonably required to adequately supply the beneficial needs" of the Delta and its
.14 inhabitants during events that result in substantial degradation of the water quality in the Delta, such

15 as extended droughts, levee failures, and sea level rise.

16 112. The operation of the Project is in direct contravention of its duties under Water Code

17 section 11460, the Project would deprive the Delta and its inhabitants of such fresh water. Such
18 deprivations are unlawful under the Watershed Protection Act and, therefore, the Project, as proposed,

19 cannot proceed. Additionally, the anticipated adverse impacts to surface water and groundwater

20 quality and quantity within the Delta and other areas of origin that would result from the construction

21 and operation of the Project, as proposed, likewise would result in direct and/or indirect deprivations

22 of those areas' prior rights to that water, and to the unimpaired quality of that water, in violation of

23 Water Code section 11460.

3
113. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

5 Paragraphs 1 through 112 as though fully set forth herein.
114. The State of California, as a sovereign entity, owns "all of its navigable waterways

7 and the lands lying beneath them 'as trustee of a public trust for the benefit of the people.™ (Colberg,

8 Inc. V. State of California ex rel. Dept. Pub. Wks. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 408, 416.) The State acquired title

9 as trustee to such lands and waterways upon its admission to the union. (City of Berkeley v. Superior

10 Court (1980) 26 Cal.3d 515, 521.)

11 115. The public trust doctrine in California encompasses all navigable lakes and streams,

12 and protects navigable waters from harm caused by diversion of non-navigable tributaries, including

13 those diverted and harmed by the Project. The public trust doctrine also applies to extractions of

14 groundwater that adversely affect navigable waterways.

15 116. The public trust doctrine provides for protecting people's common interest in

16 California's streams, lakes, marshlands and tidelands, and DWR has "an affirmative duty to take the

17 public trust into account in the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust

18 whenever feasible." (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine County (1983) 33 Ca1.3d

19 419, 446.) DFW-is the state's trustee for fish and wildlife resources.

20 117. The Legislature has acknowledged that "[t]he longstanding constitutional principle

21 of reasonable use and the public trust doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management and

22 are particularly important and applicable to the Delta." (Wat. Code, § 85023).

23 118. The people's interests under the public trust include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim,

24 to use for boating and general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state. Preservation of

25 public trust resources in their natural state is also essential to the public trust doctrine. (See National

26 Audubon Society v. Superior Court of Alpine County (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 434-35.)

1 119. An agency's duty to perform a public trust analysis prior to approving a project is

2 not necessarily discharged by virtue of performing CBQA review. (S.F. Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands

3 Com. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 202, 242.) Instead, public agencies have an independent duty to

4 perform a public trust consistency analysis, based on substantial evidence in the record, as part of an

5 adequate CEQA review. (lbid.)

6 120. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and

7 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation, and do so for non-public trust purposes - the
8 diversion of Delta water for consumptive use. Despite public comment regarding the Project's

9 impacts to public trust resources, and the need to protect those resources from harm by non-public

10 trust uses such as the Project's diversion of Delta water for consumptive uses, DWR argues that its

11 CEQA analysis is all that was necessary to address or examine the issue in its FEIR. Still, DWR's
12 public trust duties require DWR to examine whether its activities will protect public trust uses

13 independently of any analysis required by CEQA, and to protect those public trust uses from harm

14 from non-public trust uses.

15 121. By approving the Project without appropriate consideration of whether additional

16 Feasible alternatives could benefit public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, and

17 without adequately protecting public trust resources and uses from non-public trust uses, DWR

18 abdicated its affirmative statutory and constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect

19 publio trust uses whenever feasible," based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of
20 these alternatives on public trust resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

21 122. The Project EIR does not contain any water availability analysis that would show,

22 at a minimum, what water will be available to satisfy existing obligations, including protection of the

23 public trust, in addition to Project-facilitated exports. The EIR also fails to includes sufficient analysis

24 of how Project groundwater extraction activities during construction and diversions during operations

25 would affect public trust resources.

Re: LTO for the SWP

Dear Director Nemeth:

Pursuant to Cal. Pub, Resources Code § 21167.5, please take notice that the Central Delta
Water Agency and the South Delta Water Agency intend to commence an action in the Superior
Court of California for the County of Sacramento under the California Environmental Quality
Act ("CEQA") against the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"), concerning its
approval of the project known as the Long-Term Operation of the State Water Project
("Project"). DWR. certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project on March 27,
2020, and filed a Notice of Determination with the Office of Planning and Research on March
30, 2020.

This action will allege, amount other things, that DWR failed to properly follow the
procedures and requirements of CEQA in ways including, but not limited to: failure to
adequately identify and analyze significant environmental impacts, failure to provide an
accurate, stable, and finite project description, failure to adequately identify and analyze
cumulative impacts, failure to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, unlawful
predetermination and piecemealing, inadequate responses to comments, and failure to support
DWR's findings with substantial evidence.

Among other things, the Petition will seek to set aside findings that the Project satisfies
the requirements of CEQA and to vacate the approval of the Project until adequate CEQA review
is conducted and lawful approvals are obtained.

If you need any more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
