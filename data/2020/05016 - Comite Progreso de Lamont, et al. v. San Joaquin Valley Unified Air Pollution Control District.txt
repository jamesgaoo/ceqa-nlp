AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- INTRODUCTION

2 1. California has the largest concentration of petroleum refineries in the western United

3 States, and the third largest number of refineries in the nation after Texas and Louisiana. These

4 refineries are scattered throughout the state, from urban areas such as Los Angeles and the San

5 Francisco Bay Area to rural communities in central California's San Joaquin Valley. Refineries in

6 the San Joaquin Valley are concentrated in and around Bakersfield within Kern County, the largest

7 oil-producing and most polluted county in the state. This region suffers from the worst air quality in

8 the United States, including harmful levels of lung-searing ozone that compromises lung

9 development in children and causes other health complications. Oil and gas operations in the region

10 exacerbate these unhealthy air conditions.

11 2. Refineries routinely subject nearby residents to health burdens from a broad range of

12 processes, including gasoline production, asphalt, road oils, and gasoline blending. According to the

13 California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, these refinery processes regularly

14 release a number of 188 known toxic air contaminants and several ozone precursors, such as

15 particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. Among these toxic air pollutants are benzene, ammonia,
16 formaldehyde, and naphthalene. Several of these contaminants have devastating health consequences

17 from short-term and long-term exposures, including neurological damage in infants, leukemia, and

18 decreased lung function.

19 3. In addition to negative health effects, refineries are inherently dangerous operations

20 that often experience explosions, flaring, and fires from malfunctions. These events create life-

21 threatening situations for not only on-site workers but also communities near these hazardous

22 industrial operations. In fact, during the past few years, refineries in Kern County have experienced

23 these potentially catastrophic incidents, alarming local residents and causing several on-site injuries.

24 4. Prompted by the need to alert residents of dangerous refinery malfunctions and to
25 create transparency into the amount and types of harmful air emissions crossing refinery fencelines

26 and entering communities, Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1647 on October 8, 2017,

27 codifying Health and Safety Code section 42705.6. Under Section 42705.6, all petroleum refineries

28 in the state must design, install, and operate real-time fenceline air monitoring by January 1, 2020,
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 based on air district guidance. In addition, air districts must design, install, and operate real-time

2 community air monitoring systems near sensitive receptors, such as schools, hospitals, and day care
3 centers, by the same statutory deadline. The air emissions data from these systems must be publicly
4 available to inform local residents, including air district regulators and emergency first-responders,
5 of hazardous pollution levels from refinery operations and potential pollution sources at refineries
6 requiring repairs or other changes to reduce emissions.

7 5. The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (Valley Air) is the
8 regional air district tasked with regulating stationary sources of air pollution throughout the San
9 Joaquin Valley, including refineries in Kern County. Its mission is to "improve the health and
10 quality of life" for families throughout the region. In that capacity, the air district is responsible for
11 implementing Section 42705.6 by developing guidance materials and rules for the preparation,
12 review, and approval of refinery fenceline and refinery-adjacent community air monitoring system
13 plans.

14 6. Valley Air neglected to commence a public rulemaking process throughout 2018 and
15 most of 2019 to develop the necessary guidance materials and rules to implement Section 42705.6.
16 Air district staff, however, engaged in closed-door meetings with area refineries to discuss and
17 develop key aspects of these rules, without public notice and input. Only after a failed legislative

18 effort in September 2019 by industry lobbyists to create a last-minute exemption for certain

19 refineries under Section 42705.6, Valley Air scheduled the first public rulemaking meeting on
20 October 3, 2019- -a mere three months before Section 42705.6's January 1, 2020, compliance
21 deadline for refinery fenceline and related community air monitoring systems to be operational.
22 7. At the public meeting on October 3, the air district provided a general overview of
23 proposed Rule 4460 to implement refinery fenceline air monitoring and Rule 3200 establishing
24 refinery fees to fund community air monitoring systems. After a second public meeting on
25 November 5, Valley Air published final rules on November 19. Throughout these public meetings,
26 environmental and health organizations raised serious deficiencies in the rules and the air district's

27 compliance with Section 42705.6's mandates. Despite community concerns, Valley Air's Governing
28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Board adopted the rules on December 19, 2019, without amendments or the required guidance

2 materials.

3 8. Throughout this rulemaking process, Valley Air prioritized oil industry interests over
4 public health and safety, and its statutory obligations under Section 42705.6. The agency provided

5 unlawful exemptions, neglected to prepare required guidance materials, set the stage for continued
6 noncompliance, and prepared rules that arbitrarily limit the range of pollutants for monitoring and

7 number of community air monitoring sites.

8 9. The air district's actions jeopardize the health and safety of families that live, work,

9 and play near these refineries in the San Joaquin Valley. Valley Air denied communities near

10 refineries in the region transparency into dangerous releases from refinery malfunctions and real-

11 time emissions information about the range of air pollutants crossing the fenceline and entering their

12 neighborhoods. Petitioners bring this action to secure the air district's compliance with its statutory

13 obligations, and to protect the health and wellbeing of their members and families in the region.

14 PARTIES

15 10. Petitioner COMITE PROGRESO DE LAMONT (CPL) is a community-based
16 organization in Kern County. Lamont is a small farming community south-southeast of downtown

17 Bakersfield, within less than fifteen miles of all four of the refineries located in the San Joaquin

18 Valley. CPL's mission is "to achieve a healthy environment in Lamont, and to improve community
19 infrastructure and the quality of the lives of Lamont residents, by involving the community and
20 creating a voice to be able to advocate and deal with issues that Lamont is facing." CPL's members

21 actively engage on issues relating to oil and gas activity, both locally and statewide. Mountain View

22 Middle School in Lamont is approximately one mile from Kern Oil & Refining Co., a refinery. CPL

23 has serious concerns about the impact Valley Air's unlawful actions will have on its members who

24 work and live in close proximity to the refineries at issue.

25 11. Petitioner COMMITTEE FOR A BETTER SHAFTER (CBS) is a California non- a
26 profit organization based in Kern County. CBS's members reside in Shafter, California, which has a.
27 population of about 20,000 people. CBS's mission is to advocate for environmental health, to

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

support the development of economically and environmentally sustainable jobs, to develop and

2 promote community garden projects, and to support community development programs in south
San Joaquin Valley and Shafter. In addition, CBS strives to empower community members to be

4 active and involved in civic engagement. CBS and its members actively engage on climate issues,

5 particularly the issue of oil and gas operations, locally, regionally and statewide. CBS, whose

6 volunteers and members live in Kern County, is concerned about the health of local residents and the

7 impacts that Valley Air's rules will have on their communities.

8 12. Petitioner COMMITTEE FOR A BETTER ARVIN (CBA) is a California non-profit

9 organization based in Kern County. CBA's fifty members reside in Arvin, California, which has a

10 population of nearly 20,000 people. CBA's mission is to improve the quality of life in Arvin, to

11 inform and unite the community, to address problems facing the community, and to secure equality

12 for all residents. CBA and its members have engaged in advocacy for improved local and regional

13 air quality for many years and are concerned about the safety and health impacts of oil and gas
14 operations in the San Joaquin Valley. CBA is concerned about the impacts Valley Air's unlawful

15 rules and non-compliance with the Health and Safety Code will have on their members.

16 13. Petitioner LOST HILLS IN ACTION (LHA) is a grassroots community-based

17 organization in Kern County. Lost Hills is a community of about 2,400 residents, tucked between the
18 I-5 and the Lost Hills Oilfield in Western Kern County. Local air quality is perennial concern for

19 LHA members who are surrounded by oil and gas wells, freeway traffic, and pesticide applications.
20 LHA members frequently engage in local, regional, and statewide issues relating to oil and gas

21 activity. California Air Resources Board selected Lost Hills as the first community to undergo the

22 "Study of Neighborhood Air Near Petroleum Sources" (SNAPS) to monitor and identify pollution

23 contributing to local air quality. LHA is concerned about Valley Air's refusal to comply with the

24 Health and Safety Code as monitoring and identifying pollution sources throughout the San Joaquin

25 Valley is important to their members.

26 14. Petitioner ASSOCIATION OF IRRITATED RESIDENTS (AIR) is a California non-

27 profit organization based in Kern County. AIR formed in 1991 to advocate for clean air and
28 environmental justice throughout California's San Joaquin Valley. AIR has dozens of members who
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

reside in Kern, Tulare, Kings, Fresno, and Stanislaus counties. AIR members through themselves,

2 their families, and friends, have direct experience with the health impacts and safety hazards that

3 arise from operations at refineries in the region. AIR is concerned about Valley Air's unlawful rules

4 and failure to comply with the Health and Safety Code.

5 15. Petitioner CLEAN WATER ACTION (CWA) is a non-profit organization with

6 approximately 700,000 members across the United States. CWA's mission is to protect the
7 "environment, health, and economic well-being and community quality of life." CWA's efforts

8 include addressing pollution from oil and gas activities in the San Joaquin Valley. CWA's members

9 in and around Kern County are concerned about the health and safety impacts caused by refineries in

10 the region, and Valley Air's unlawful actions and non-compliance with the Health and Safety Code.

11 16. Respondent SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY UNIFIED AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

12 DISTRICT (Valley Air) is an air quality regulatory agency with "primary responsibility for control
13 of air pollution from all sources, other than emissions from motor vehicles" in the San Joaquin

14 Valley Basin. (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 40000, 40600(a).) Valley Air serves a central role in
15 implementing both the federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act in the Basin, which

16 includes Fresno, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare counties, in addition to

17 a portion of the County of Kern. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 60107.)

18 17. By this action, Petitioners seek to protect the health and welfare of their members,

19 including the public. Petitioners' members have an interest in their health and well-being, and in the

20 health and well-being of others, including residents living near petroleum refineries in Kern County.

21 Unless the court grants the relief requested in this case, Petitioners' members and the public will

22 suffer adverse effects and irreparable injuries from Valley Air's failure to comply with the Health

23 and Safety Code.

24 18. At this time, Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether

25 individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 1 through DOE 30,

26 inclusive, and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest DOE 1 through DOE 30, inclusive, under

27 such fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition and Complaint to show their true names

28 and capacities when known.

AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 19. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition under Code of

3 Civil Procedure sections 526, 1060 and 1085.

4 20. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California, County of Fresno under Code of

5 Civil Procedure section 395 because Valley Air's headquarters is located in the County of Fresno.

6 21. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and
7 have exhausted all available remedies to the extent required by law.

8 22. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this Court

9 grants the requested writ of mandate to require that Valley Air meet its statutory obligations and

10 adopt rules that comply with California's Health and Safety Code.

11 STATUTORY BACKGROUND

12 23. Petroleum refineries engage in a range of processes involving the storage and
13 manufacture of petroleum products. These processes include not only crude oil refining to produce

14 gasoline and other transportation fuels, but also other refining activities that encompass gasoline

15 blending and the production of asphalt materials and road oils for paving.

16 24. Regardless of their size and location, refineries are inherently dangerous operations
17 | that experience fires, explosions, and flaring events from malfunctions and other process upsets.

18 Several incidents at California refineries in recent years illustrate the hazards these operations pose

19 to onsite workers and surrounding communities. For instance, on August 6, 2012, a large fire at the
20 Chevron Refinery in Richmond resulted in a plume of black smoke visible for miles, forcing

21 thousands of residents to seek medical treatment for respiratory distress. On February 18, 2015, an

22 explosion occurred at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, injuring several workers and creating a

23 1.7 magnitude earthquake felt miles from the refinery. The explosion propelled an 80,000-pound

24 component that narrowly missed a tank containing hydrogen fluoride, an extremely volatile chemical

25 with the potential to kill or injure thousands of residents near the refinery.

26 25. These emergencies are not exclusive to larger refinery operations in urban areas.

27 Several hazardous incidents have also occurred at refineries in rural parts of the San Joaquin Valley

28 over the years. For example, on January 19, 2005, an explosion at Kern Oil & Refining in
7

AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

*

-

2 Bakersfield killed one worker and severely burned two others. On December 23,.2010, an oil tanker

3 truck caught fire and exploded near a 42,000-gallon oil storage tank at San Joaquin Refining Co. in

4 Bakersfield, threatening a major catastrophe and injuring several workers. On November 29, 2011, a

5 2.5 million gallon storage tank exploded and caught fire at Alon Bakersfield Refining, rattling

6 nearby businesses and residents, and creating a plume of black smoke visible for miles. More

7 recently, on January 8, 2018, fire crews responded to a large fire inside a cooling tower at Kern Oil
& Refining Co.

8 26.

9 In addition to safety hazards, official air emissions inventories reported by refineries

10 to air districts from routine operations reveal that refineries are among the largest stationary sources

11 of air pollution in the state. All refineries in the state are required to submit emissions inventories

12 annually to local air districts, providing these regulatory agencies with an estimate or approximation

13 of the total air pollution released by each refinery during the prior year.

27.

14 These official air emissions inventories confirm that refineries routinely release

15 significant quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen

16 oxides and particulate matter, which worsen air quality and negati vely impact public health. For

17 instance, ground level ozone forms through a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides and VOCs

18 in the presence of sunlight. Ozone can cause premature death from asthma and other respiratory
illnesses, and compromises lung development in children.

19 28.

20 Similarly, fine particulate matter 10 or 2.5 micrometers in diameter are smaller than

21 the width of a single hair and able to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. These

22 particulates contribute to cardiovascular and respiratory disease, including strokes, lung cancer, and
asthma. In the San Joaquin Valley area, Kern County

23 is in non-attainment of federal ozone and
particulate matter standards set to protect public health.

24 29.

25 Moreover, a report published by the California Office of Environmental Health

26 Hazard Assessment reviewed previous annual refinery emissions inventories and found that

27 refineries release a number of 188 toxic air contaminants and hazardous VOCs, including benzene,

28 toluene, hydrogen sulfide, formaldehyde, ammonia, and naphthalene. These toxic emissions can

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

have short-term and long-term health consequences for surrounding communities, including cancer,

2 tumors, developmental defects, memory impairment, cataracts, and tremors.

3 30. Notably, annual official air emissions inventories reported by refineries to air districts

4 severely underestimate actual emissions. These inventories fail to capture releases from fugitive

5 emissions or leaks from various sources at refineries, including process equipment, storage tanks,

6 and malfunctions that bypass pollution controls. If unaddressed, these fugitive emissions can release

7 large amounts of VOCs and other pollutants into the environment and harm public health.

31. Given these refinery safety hazards and significant air emissions, communities near
refineries throughout California have grown increasingly concerned about potentially catastrophic

10 incidents and harmful releases. In an effort to identify pollution sources at all refineries, to inform

11 appropriate measures to reduce emissions, and to alert residents when pollution levels become

12 hazardous, Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi introduced Assembly Bill (AB) 1647 on February 17,

13 2017, to amend the Health and Safety Code to add section 42705.6. As noted by Assemblymember

14 Muratsuchi, the intent of Section 42705.6 was to cover "all California refineries" and surrounding

15 communities.

16 32. Section 42705.6 required that by January 1, 2020, "the owner or operator of a

17 petroleum refinery shall develop, install, operate, and maintain a fence-line monitoring system in

18 accordance with guidance developed by the appropriate district." (Health & Saf. Code, §
19 42705.6(c).) The statute defines fenceline monitoring as systems "useful for detecting or estimating
20 the quantity of fugitive emissions, gas leaks, and other air emissions" from refineries. (Health & Saf.

21 Code, § 42705.6(a)(2).)

22 33. Similarly, each air district "shall design, develop, install, operate, and maintain the

23 refinery-related community air monitoring system[s]" by January 1, 2020. (Health & Saf. Code, §
24 42705.6(b)(1).) These community air-monitoring systems should be located "at or near sensitive

25 receptor locations near a petroleum refinery" and "may be useful for estimating associated pollutant

26 exposures and health risks and in determining trends in air pollutant levels over time." (Health &
27 Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(1).)

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 34. Further, each air district must develop "guidance" to implement both refinery.

2 fenceline and related community air monitoring systems. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(b)(1), (c).)

3 This guidance is required to consider "technological capabilities" for air monitoring and "incorporate

4 input from affected parties" in the area. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(e).)

5 35. The Legislature passed AB 1647 on September 13, 2017. Subsequently, on October 8,
6 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 1647 codifying Section 42705.6. The Secretary

7 of State chaptered the bill that same day, and Section 42705.6 became effective January 1, 2018.

8 RULEMAKING PROCESS

9 36. Starting January 1, 2018, Section 42705.6 tasked local air districts with adopting

10 implementing rules and guidance materials to ensure the development, installation, and operation of

11 refinery fenceline and refinery-related community air monitoring requirements by the January 1,

12 2020, compliance deadline. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(b)(1), (c).)

13 37. The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (Valley Air) is the

14 regulating authority for stationary sources of air pollution in the "Counties of Fresno, Kings,

15 Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare", and "the portion of the County of Kern that

16 is within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin .. (Health & Saf. Code, § 40600(a).) Accordingly,

17 Valley Air is responsible for implementing Section 42705.6 in the Basin.

18 38. Petroleum refineries in the region are located in and around Bakersfield, the largest

19 municipality in Kern County with a population of about 350,000 people, and include Alon

20 Bakersfield Refining, San Joaquin Refining Co., Kern Oil & Refining Co., and Tricor Refining LLC.

21 These four refineries operate within some of the most environmentally overburdened communities in

22 the state. These communities experience drinking water contamination, toxic pesticide exposures,

23 and unhealthy air quality considered the worst in the nation.

24 39. Despite Valley Air's obligations under Section 42705.6, the air district refused to

25 schedule public meetings throughout 2018 and most of 2019 to develop implementing rules and

26 guidance materials for the preparation, review, and approval of refinery fenceline and refinery-

27 related community air monitoring systems.

28

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

40. On February 5, 2019, Valley Air published a rule forecast for 2019, noting the air

2 district would "work closely with affected stakeholders through a robust public process" to develop

3 rules implementing Section 42705.6. Accordingly, the forecast stated air district staff would "hold a

4 Scoping Meeting in early 2019 to receive public input on the development" of these rules.

5 41. Valley Air, however, did not hold this public scoping meeting or invite public input

6 on these implementing rules. Instead, communication records reveal that starting in April 2019, the

7 air district engaged in closed-door meetings and telephone calls with refineries in the region to
discuss and develop these rules. For instance, e-mail records from these meetings note the air

9 district's willingness to consider the refineries' suggestion to "separat[e] the facilities based on size

10 into different categories for monitoring purposes."

11 42. In September 2019, towards the end of the legislative session, Assemblymember

12 Rudy Salas from Bakersfield used an unsuccessful "gut-and-amend" legislative tactic to create a

13 last-minute exemption under Section 42705.6 for refineries processing below 55,000 barrels per day

14 and with populations of under 3,000 within a one-mile radius. The bill would have benefitted rural

15 refineries in Kern County, in particular Kern Oil & Refining Co. However, due to strong opposition

16 from public health and environmental groups, including several Petitioners, the bill failed to pass.

17 43. After this failed legislative effort by oil lobbyists, Valley Air finally scheduled a

18 public meeting on October 3, 2019, to discuss implementing rules- a mere three months before the

19 January 1, 2020, compliance deadline under Section 42705.6 for refineries and the air district to

20 begin operating air monitoring systems. At this meeting, the air district provided an update on two

21 rules to implement Section 42705.6's requirements: Rule 4460 establishing the general

22 requirements, and the air district's review and approval process for refinery fenceline air monitoring

23 plans, and Rule 3200 setting refinery fees to fund the air district's refinery-related community air

24 monitoring systems.

25 44. On November 5, Valley Air held a second public meeting on these rules. During both

26 the October 3 and November 5 public meetings, the air district neglected to discuss the status of
27 statutorily mandated guidance materials and to provide for public input on those materials. (Health

28 & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(e).)
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

45. On November 19, shortly after these two stakeholder meetings, the air district

2 released the final Rules 4460 and 3200. Various organizations and community groups, including

3 several of the Petitioners, raised serious deficiencies with these rules. The rules provided for

4 unlawful compliance exemptions, set the stage for continued compliance delays with statutory
mandates, and contained arbitrary limits on the number of pollutants for monitoring and number of

6 community air monitoring sites. Moreover, the air district neglected to provide the guidance

7 materials for the preparation of refinery fenceline and related community air monitoring plans as

8 mandated by Section 42705.6.

9 46. Despite these concerns, Valley Air's Governing Board adopted the rules on

10 December 19, 2019, without amendments or the required guidance materials. The air district failed

11 to meet its obligations under Section 42705.6. Moreover, several aspects of these rules are unlawful

12 and contrary to the requirements of Section 42705.6 and constitute an abuse of discretion.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Traditional Mandate: Violation of the Health &

15 Safety CodeUnlawful Exemptions)

16 47. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through

17 46 above.

18 48. Section 42705.6 applies to all "petroleum refiner[ies]" in California. (Health & Saf.

19 Code, § 42705.6(c), (f)(1).) Valley Air acknowledged there are four "petroleum refineries" in the

20 region, namely Alon Bakersfield Refining, San Joaquin Refining Co., Kern Oil & Refining Co., and

21 Tricor Refining LLC. In addition, air district staff conceded refineries engage in a variety of

22 activitics, including "refining, blending, or storing a variety of specialized products such as biofuels,

23 asphalt products, drilling fluids, fuel additives, hydraulic fluids, and lubricants" among other

24 processes.

25 49. Rules 4460 and 3200, however, provide unlawful compliance and air pollutant
26 monitoring exemptions to refineries based on "crude oil" refining activity and capacity. These

27 "crude oil" exemptions serve to both exclude two of the four refineries in the region from complying

28

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

whatsoever with Section 42705.6's requirements, and narrow the range of air pollutants for

2 monitoring by the remaining two refineries.

50. First, the rules provide a compliance exemption to refineries "not currently engaged

4 in refining crude oil," after the submission of declarations asserting the refineries are "not refining

5 crude oil." These exempt refineries are not required to plan and install fenceline air monitoring

6 systems, nor pay the necessary fees to fund the air district's development, installation, and operation

7 of refinery-related community air monitoring systems. According to Valley Air, this compliance

8 exemption applies to Alon Bakersfield Refining and Tricor Refining LLC refineries that are

9 purportedly not currently "refining crude oil."

10 51. Reported air emissions inventories, however, confirm these refineries continue to

11 engage in a variety of other petroleum refining activities that release a number of pollutants into

12 surrounding communities, even if not "refining crude oil." Notably, these refineries hold valid

13 operating permits to refine crude and must comply with other federal and state laws and regulations,
14 including Valley Air rules, applicable to petroleum refineries despite not currently "refining crude

15 oil."

16 52. Second, the rules exempt refineries from monitoring air pollutants based on "crude

17 oil" refining capacity. Under Rule 4460, refineries with a capacity of less than 40,000 "barrels per

18 day" (bpd) of crude oil" need only consider monitoring a limited number of pollutants, namely

19 sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
20 xylene).

21 53. Refineries with a capacity of 40,000 bpd or more, however, must consider these

22 pollutants and several others for monitoring, including total volatile organic compounds (VOCs),

23 ammonia, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon. Rule 3200 incorporates this monitoring exemption into

24 refinery-related community air monitoring requirements, providing for reduced air pollutant tracking

25 and fees for refineries with a capacity of less than 40,000 bpd.

26 54. This monitoring exemption applies to San Joaquin Refining Co. and Kern Oil &

27 Refining Co. because they are currently "refining crude oil." Reported air emissions inventories,

28 however, confirm routine operations at these refineries release several air pollutants Rule 4460
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P

P exempts the refineries from considering for monitoring, such as total VOCs, ammonia, nitrogen

2 oxides, and black carbon. Notably, these emissions inventories do not account for all fugitive

3 emissions and releases from malfunctions and other non-routine events.

4 55. The air district's monitoring exemptions undermine Section 42705.6's purpose to

5 detect and estimate "the quantity of fugitive emissions, gas leaks, and other air emissions" at

6 refineries. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(2).) Moreover, the exemptions compromise the ability

7 to estimate "associated pollutant exposures and health risks and in determining trends in air pollutant

8 levels over time" using community air monitoring systems. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(1).)

9 56. On its face, Section 42705.6 does not provide any exemptions to refineries or narrow

10 the application of the statute to refineries solely engaged in "crude oil" refining. Valley Air's

11 interpretation of Section 42705.6 as authorizing the creation of exemptions for refineries based on

12 "crude oil" refining activity or capacity is unlawful and contrary to the plain, commonsense meaning
13 of the language in the statute.
14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Traditional Mandate: Violation of the Health &

16 Safety Code Failure to Prepare Guidance)

17 57. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through

18 56 above.

19 58. Section 42705.6 requires Valley Air to prepare "guidance" documents for the
20 development, installation, operation, and maintenance of refinery fenceline and refinery-related

21 community air monitoring systems. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(b)(1), (c).)

22 59. Guidance materials assist in standardizing and preparing the monitoring systems and

23 plans, including location of monitoring equipment, standard operating procedures, equipment
24 I maintenance procedures, and public notification features. These guidance materials are distinct from

25 implementing Rule 4460, which establishes the monitoring plan review and approval process,
26 general monitoring plan elements, range of pollutants subject to monitoring, among other basic

27 requirements.

28 //

14

AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 60.

2 In developing this guidance, the air district is required to "take into account

3 technological capabilities and incorporate input from affected parties" in the area. (Health & Saf.

4 Code, § 42705.6(e).) Both the fenceline and community air-monitoring systems must be developed,

5 installed, and operated in accordance with this guidance. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(b)(1), (c).)

6 Accordingly, other air districts, such as the South Coast Air Quality Management District, developed
guidance materials concurrently with implementing rules for Section 42705.6.

7 61.

8 Valley Air did not provide draft guidance materials for public review and input

9 during the October 3 and November 5, 2019, public meetings. Air district staff communications on

10 October 9, 2019, confirm the agency was still in the process of "mimicking the South Coast [Air

11 Quality Management District] refinery monitoring guidelines." Valley Air failed to complete this

12 guidance by the December 19, 2019, Governing Board meeting to adopt Rules 4460 and 3200.

62.

13 The air district's December 19 staff report confirmed that "to provide clarity for

14 petroleum refineries and consistency in submitted air monitoring plans," the agency would "provide
written guidance .

15 on the required elements of the air monitoring plans to be submitted."Valley

16 Air, however, did not provide a timeline, and did not finalize the required guidance materials.

63. The air district has not issued the

17 necessary guidance documents. In addition, based

18 on information and belief, air district staff does not intend to offer a public process for "affected

19 parties" to provide input. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(e).) Valley Air's failure to issue guidance

20 materials and provide for input from affected parties, including Petitioners, is unlawful and contrary
to its obligations under Section 42705.6.

21 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Traditional Mandate: Violation of the Health &

23

24 Safety CodeUnreasonable Delay of Community Air Monitoring Systems)

64.

25 63 above. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through

26 65.

27 Effective January 1, 2018, Section 42705.6 directed that each air district "shall

28 design, develop, install, operate, and maintain" refinery-related community air monitoring systems
by January 1, 2020. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(b)(1).)
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

/

66. In an effort to comply with Section 42705.6's mandate that Valley Air develop,

2 install, and operate community air monitoring systems, the air district's Governing Board adopted

3 Rule 3200 on December 19, 2019-less than two weeks before the January 1, 2020, compliance

4 deadline.

5 67. Rule 3200, however, merely requires that refineries pay fees by July 1, 2020, to fund

6 the air district's community air monitoring systems. Other than setting fees, the rule neglects to

7 establish any deadlines for the air district to develop, install, and operate community air monitoring

8 systems.

9 68. Valley Air's unreasonable and ongoing delay to comply with this statutory mandate
10 since 2018 is unlawful and contrary to Section 42705.6's statutory mandates.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Traditional Mandate: Violation of the Health & Safety Code-Unreasonable
13 Delay of Refinery Fenceline Air Monitoring Plan Review and Determination)

14 69. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through

15 68 above.

16 70. Effective January 1, 2018, Section 42705.6 directed that refineries "shall develop,

17 install, operate, and maintain a fence-line monitoring system" by January 1, 2020. (Health & Saf.

18 Code, § 42705.6(c).) To meet this legislative deadline, air districts have the primary responsibility to

19 review and approve fenceline air monitoring plans well before January 1, 2020.

20 71. In an attempt to comply with Section 42705.6's mandate that Valley Air review and

21 approve refinery fenceline air monitoring plans, the air district's Governing Board adopted Rule

22 4460 on December 19, 2019 less than two weeks before the January 1, 2020, compliance deadline

23 for refineries to develop, install, and operate fenceline air monitoring systems.

24 72. Rule 4460 establishes the air district's refinery fenceline air monitoring plan review

25 and approval process, among other requirements. Rule 4460, however, allows for additional delay

26 and creates uncertainty regarding when the air district will complete its review and approve or

27 disapprove refinery fenceline air monitoring plans.

28 //

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

73. Under Rule 4460, refineries are required to develop and submit fenceline air

2 monitoring plans to the air district for review by July 1, 2020. After submission, however, the rule

3 does not provide a timeline for Valley Air to complete its review and approve or disapprove refinery

4 fenceline monitoring plans.

5 74. The air district's omission allows for further delays in the installation and operation

6 of refinery fenceline air monitoring systems. Under Rule 4460, a refinery is required to install and

7 operate a fenceline air monitoring system "within 365 calendar days" only after the air district

8 approves the refinery's fenceline air monitoring plan.
75. Valley Air's unreasonable delay to comply with this statutory mandate to review and

10 approve fenceline air monitoring plans will continue under Rule 4460's fenceline air monitoring

11 plan review and approval process. The air district's ongoing delay is unlawful and contrary to

12 Section 42705.6's statutory mandates.

13 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Traditional Mandate: Arbitrary and Capricious Rulemaking)

15 76. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through

16 75 above.

17 77. In this rulemaking, Valley Air failed to consider "all relevant factors" adequately and
18 demonstrate "a rational connection between those factors, the choice made, and the purposes of the

19 enabling statute." (American Coatings Assn., Inc. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.

20 (2012) 54 Cal.4th 446, 460.) Several aspects of Rules 4460 and 3200 are "arbitrary, capricious,

21 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair." (Ibid.)

22 a. Arbitrary Fenceline Air Pollutant Monitoring Requirements

23 78. Rule 4460 provides for arbitrary and capricious air pollutant monitoring requirements

24 a because only refineries with a capacity of 40,000 or more barrels per day (bpd) must monitor for the

25 full range of air district identified pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic
26 compounds (VOCs), BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), formaldehyde,

27 acetaldehyde, acrolein, 1,3 butadiene, styrene, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, ammonia,

28

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P*

hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen fluoride, and black carbon. This requirement would apply primarily to

2 Alon Bakersfield Refining (66,000 bpd capacity).

3 79. Refineries with capacity of less than 40,000 bpd, however, must monitor a very

4 limited number of pollutants--erely six of the air district identified pollutants. As a result, Kern a
Oil & Refining Co. (26,000 bpd capacity), San Joaquin Refining Co. (15,000 bpd capacity), and

6 Tricor Refining LLC (12,500 bpd capacity) will not monitor for most of the pollutants identified by

7 the air district.

8 80. Valley Air's staff report, however, does not provide evidentiary support for the

9 limited air pollutant monitoring requirements for the three refineries with a capacity of less than

10 40,000 bpd. The staff report concludes, without any evidence or detail, that "some listed pollutants

11 may not be present at a particular facility." Valley Air failed to provide any rational connection

12 between the 40,000 bpd threshold and creating an exemption from monitoring pollutants from

13 refining activities.

14 81. Emissions data confirms these three exempt refineries release significant amounts of
15 several pollutants identified by the air district, including VOCs, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and black
16 carbon. Despite this evidence, Rule 4460 arbitrarily permits these three refineries to monitor only for

17 small subset of pollutants.

18 82. Valley Air's decision to limit air pollutant-monitoring requirements and foreclose
19 consideration of other pollutants for refineries with a capacity of less than 40,000 bpd is arbitrary,

20 capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support. Rule 4460 allows refineries to "not monitor

21 one or more of the specified pollutants" after providing "sufficient justification." Rather than require

22 refineries to consider the full range of pollutants, regardless of bpd capacity, and then justify any

23 exclusion, the rule forecloses that opportunity. Instead, the rule only requires refineries with a

24 capacity of less than 40,000 bpd to monitor for an incomplete and arbitrary list of pollutants.
25 83. Further, in this rulemaking, the agency failed to consider other relevant factors
26 outlined in Section 42705.6, including whether the range of selected pollutants will be "useful for

27 detecting or estimating the quantity of fugitive emissions, gas leaks, and other air emissions from the

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

•1

refinery." (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(2).) Consequently, Valley Air failed to establish a

2 rational connection between its decision and the relevant factors and purpose of Section 42705.6.

3 b. Arbitrary Community Air Monitoring Requirements

4 84. Section 42705.6 requires community air monitoring "at or near sensitive receptor

5 locations" that "may be useful for estimating associated pollutant exposures and health risks and in
6 determining trends in air pollution levels over time." (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(1).)

7 Petroleum refineries are responsible for the air district's costs of implementing community air
8 monitoring. (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(f)(1).)

9 85. Rule 3200 establishes the fees for Valley Air to install, operate, and maintain

10 community air monitoring equipment. These fees provide for one community air monitoring station

11 per refinery, and fund pre-determined equipment to track the same arbitrary list of pollutants under

12 Rule 4460. Valley Air's decision to provide only for a single community air monitoring station per

13 refinery is arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

14 86. The air district staff failed to explain and the staff report lacks any evidence

15 supporting the sufficiency of a single community monitoring station to "estimat[e] associated

16 pollutant exposures and health risks" and to "determin[e] trends in air pollutant levels over time."

17 (Health & Saf. Code, § 42705.6(a)(1).) Valley Air failed to detail and consider relevant factors,

18 including the location of sensitive receptors, topography in the area, and meteorological and

19 atmospheric conditions. These factors inform the appropriate number and placement of community
20 air monitoring stations.

21 87. Moreover, the rule applies the same arbitrary and capricious limited air pollutant-

22 monitoring requirements under Rule 4460. and arbitrarily denies the public, including Petitioners, a

23 public comment opportunity despite providing a public review process under Rule 4460 for refinery

24 fenceline air monitoring plans.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort
damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the
complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
