PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs Donald McPherson and Coastal Defender ("Petitioners") bring

3 this lawsuit to challenge Respondents and Defendants City of Manhattan Beach ("the City's") and

4 Manhattan Beach City Council's ("City Council's") (collectively, "Respondents") May 14, 2020

5 approval permitting Real Party in Interest Simms Restaurant Group ("Real Party" or "RPI") to expand

6 the alcohol use at their MB Post restaurant into the former non-alcohol serving Subway, adjacent on the

7 north and to increase the hours of operation of the combined eating and drinking places until 1 AM, a

8 deviation from most similar businesses in the City of Manhattan Beach. MB Post and the former

9 Subway ("Premises") are respectively located at 1142 and 1144 Manhattan Avenue, within 100 feet of

10 numerous residential buildings in downtown Manhattan Beach. Respondents based their decision to

11 approve the expansion on their stated belief that the restaurant owner is a responsible operator and

12 personally reliable, not on an evaluation of the possible environmental impacts of the significant

13 expansion. Respondents did not consider the likelihood a that a future owner can and will operate the

14 combined premises more as a nightclub.

15 2. Respondents could not have based their approval on an evaluation of environmental

16 impacts of the expansion, because the City did not undertake any examination of the possible

17 environmental impact. Instead, over the objections of Petitioners and other members of public,

18 including residential neighbors of the two restaurant parcels, Respondents relied upon a Class 1

19 categorical exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Petitioners objected
20 to the use of this exemption, both because expansion of the facility does satisfy the requirement of the

21 Class 1 exemption of a "negligible" expansion of use. Moreover, even if the exemption were found to

22 apply, the unusual circumstances of MB Post, including its location within close proximity to residential

23 buildings, its unusually late hours for the location and type of premise in the City, and the predicted

24 impacts of night time noise at nearby residences, as established by expert analysis.

25 3. In addition, the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code requires that a City make a finding
a 26 that a new or expanded proposed use complies with the City's performance standards, which include the

27 noise ordinance. Petitioners' expert noise evaluation demonstrates that the premises will substantially

28 violate the noise ordinance.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

I 4. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate to set aside Resolution 20-0049 because it was

2 approved without proper environmental review and is contrary to the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code;

3 injunctive relief to prevent Respondents or Real Parties from operating in reliance upon the defective

4 and illegal approvals, and a determination from this Court that Respondents failed to comply with the

5 CEQA and Manhattan Beach Municipal Code in approving the expanded hours and additional special

6 events for the Premises.

7 5. Additionally, Petitioners seek a writ of mandate to enforce their right to records under the

8 California Public Records Act, Government Code section 6250, et seq. ("CPRA"), and the California

9 I, Constitution, Article I, section 3. Petitioners have requested on several occasions that the City provide

10 documents within the City's files that are relevant to the approvals in question and have received no

11 response, even after informing the City that they would seek judicial relief for the City's failure to

12 respond.

13 PARTIES

14 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff DONALD MCPHERSON is a resident a and taxpayer of the City

15 of Manhattan Beach. Dr. McPherson owns a residence in the Downtown area and is personally

16 impacted by intensified late-night operations of eating and drinking places there. Dr. McPherson

17 participated in proceedings before the Manhattan Beach City Council, and appealed the determination of

18 the Planning Commission to the City Council.

19 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff COASTAL DEFENDER is a non-profit public benefit
20 corporation operating to protect the quality of life in the City of Manhattan Beach.

21 8. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF MANHATTAN BEACH is a charter city and the

22 governmental entity serving the people of the City of Manhattan Beach, in which the Premises is

23 located. The City is a "local agency" as defined by Government Code § 6252, subdivision (a), and is

24 therefore subject to the CPRA.

25 9. Respondent and Defendant MANHATTAN BEACH CITY COUNCIL is the five-

26 member elected body that represents the citizens of Manhattan Beach. The Council was the final

27 decision-making body that approved the expansion of use for the Premises.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 16. MB Post and the former Subway are located at 1142 and 1144 Manhattan Avenue in the
3 City of Manhattan Beach, respectively. The former Subway currently does not have an alcohol license.

4 It is operated by Real Party in Interest Simms Restaurant Group, which also operates other restaurants in

5 the City of Manhattan Beach. This includes Fishing with Dynamite located 1148 Manhattan Avenue,

6 adjacent on the north to the former Subway. Consequently, the Simms Group operates three adjoining

7 eating and drinking places, adjacent to residences 100 feet away.

8 17. MB Post operates pursuant to a Use Permit Amendment issued in 1999, City Council

9 Resolution No. 5513. Resolution No. 5513 allows MB Post to offer full alcohol service, food service,
10 and limited entertainment. The approved hours of operation for pursuant to Resolution No. 5513 MB
11 Post were 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m., Thursday

12 through Friday, and 7:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. on Saturdays, and 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Sundays.

13 18. Next to MB Post at 1144 Manhattan Avenue, a Subway restaurant had operated in a
14 1,447 square foot space. This space was authorized for use as a restaurant by Board of Zoning
15 Adjustment Resolution 82-41, which authorized a "restaurant, juice bar, and deli service." No alcohol

16 consumption was allowed by BZA Resolution No. 82-41. At the time of the application at issue, the

17 space was vacant.

18 19. Real Party in Interest applied to the City for an amendment to the existing Use Permit

19 Amendment that had been authorized by Resolution No. 5513, seeking approval to expand its existing
20 3,283 square-foot restaurant into the adjacent 1,447 square-foot neighboring building. In addition, Real
21 Party in Interest requires to partially enclose a 148 square-foot arca in front of the Subway, increasing
22 the total square footage of the restaurant to 4,878 square feet. Per BZA Resolution No. 82-41, this area
23 formerly unused.

24 20. Renovations in the application include openable windows facing Manhattan Avenue in
25 the "Atrium Dining Area" and "Lounge Area," eliminating the French doors that open onto Manhattan

26 Avenue.

27

28

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

21. Real Party in Interest also requested to expand its operating hours in connection with its

2 new, larger restaurant. The request was to open at 6:00 a.m. daily, and to extend closing time to 1:00

3 a.m. on Thursday through Saturday.

4 22. On March 11, 2020, the Planning Commission considered Real Party's request. During

5 the public comment period, four residents testified of their concern that the proposed restaurant's floor

6 plan would allow the restaurant to operate more as a bar than a restaurant, and that additional noise

7 associated with the extra hour of alcohol service would create a neighborhood disturbance.

8 23. The Planning Commission supported the proposed amendment, and specifically praised

9 the applicant's history of responsible operations. The Planning Commission placed certain conditions

10 on the application, including the requirement that windows facing Manhattan Avenue by closed no later

11 than 10:00 p.m. every day, and to cease selling alcoholic beverages at 12:00 a.m. Thursday through

12 Saturday. The Planning Commission required staff to report to the Planning Commission a year after

13 commencement of operations at the expanded restaurant.

14 24. Petitioner McPherson and James Quilliam, who are President and Vice President of

15 Coastal Defender, along with Coastal Defender itself, appealed the Planning Commission's decision to

16 the Manhattan Beach City Council on March 24, 2020.

17 25. The appeal questioned how the project's use of open windows would not result in a

18 violation of the City's noise ordinance, and that the location of this business within 100 feet of residents

19 would interfere with the quiet enjoyment of the property by residents. The appeal raised issues with the

20 lack of environmental review. The appeal pointed out that the French doors of MB Post are welded shut

21 SO the change to operable windows would significantly increase the transmission of noise from the

22 premises. The appeal requested that the business's hours of operation be limited to midnight, seven

23 days a week, that all windows and the south door be closed at 10:00 p.m., and that glazing sound-

24 attenuation be required to reduce noise transmission.

25 26. On May 5, 2020, the City Council held a public hearing to consider the appeal and

26 conduct a de novo review of the Use Permit Amendment application. At the hearing, in addition to the

27 testimony and comments from the applicants and the appellants, over 30 people spoke in support of the

28

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

-

2 project and approximately 12 people spoke in opposition, primarily with concerns regarding the

3 proposed one hour extension to closing time on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.

27.

4 Petitioner submitted testimony from Steve Rogers Acoustics, LLC along with analysis

5 from Petitioners and their counsel in support of the appeal. Steve Rogers Acoustics conducted a noise

6 impact analysis of the proposal. The analysis concluded that exterior noise levels from the facility with

7 windows open during hours prior to 10 p.m. would significantly exceeds the City's exterior noise

8 standards, including at the nearby residential uses. Even without factoring in amplified music, patron's

9 voices would exceed the noise thresholds with the windows open at certain locations. The analysis

10 concluded "[o]n all counts, we conclude that operation noise from the restaurant would very likely be in

11 clear violation of the noise regulations in the [Manhattan Beach Municipal Code] and would therefore
constitute a significant impact on the surrounding uses."

12 28.

13 Petitioners submitted comments noting that the request for extended operating hours

14 would be used as a basis for other similar restaurants to seek extensions to operate after midnight.

15 Petitioners also objected to the failure to require physical mitigation measures for noise impacts,

16 including sound blocking windows and a double-door a entrance vestibule. Petitioners noted that of the

17 35 restaurants permitted to serve alcohol in the downtown area, 19 have closing hours of midnight or
earlier.

18 Since 2002, no Use Permit Amendment had increased operating hours, although
businesses with older use permits were permitted to keep their hours past midnight. some

19 29. Counsel for Petitioners presented testimony regarding compliance with CEQA and the
20 Manhattan Beach Municipal Code. Counsel explained that a CEQA exemption was improper, both

21

22 because the project did not qualify for the categorical exemption, and that even if it did, exceptions to
the categorical exemption applied.

23 30.

24 The City Council deliberated regarding the appeal. Many of the Councilmembers

25 commented favorably on the application because they held a high opinion of the operator. One

26 Councilmember objected: "I'm against expanding the closing hour to 1AM . . . and here's why . .. it

27 does bother me a little bit a that much of the argument has been, that these particular owners can handle

28 this provision responsibly. . .. I don't think the character of the applicant should be the primary
driver... It kills me to not be supportive of a responsible business owner, but to me it's not the character

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

F of the applicant, it's the precedent it sets for our beach community going forward." At the end of the

2 public hearing, Council moved to instruct staff to prepare a resolution adopting the conditions proposed

3 by the Planning Commission, except that the one year review would be conducted by the City Council,

4 not the Planning Commission.

5 31. On May 14, 2020, Resolution 20-0049 was adopted on the consent calendar by the City

6 Council.

7 32. A Notice of Exemption was posted on May 14, 2020, with the Los Angeles County

8 Clerk. The Notice of Exemption stated that it applied to a "Use Permit Amendment for an Existing

9 Restaurant with Full Alcohol Service (Manhattan Beach Post) to Allow an Expansion of the Use into an

10 Adjacent Vacant Restaurant Space (Formerly Subway) and an Extension of Operating Hours at 1142

11 and 1144 Manhattan Avenue."

12 33. The Notice of Exemption stated that CEQA Guidelines section 15301, the existing

13 facilities exemption, was the basis of the project's CEQA exemption. The Notice contended that "[t]he

14 expansion is less than 50 percent of the floor area of the current restaurant and is less than 2,500 square

15 feet, and thus fits within the language of Section 15301." Moreover, "[e]xpanding operating hours does

16 not entail construction, expansion, or addition."

17 34. The Notice of Exemption states that there are not exceptions to the categorical

18 exemption, including on the basis of cumulative impact or unusual circumstances. The notice contends

19 that the extension of hours would not set any precedent for any other business in the neighborhood, and

20 that the expansion of the restaurant was not unusual in an urbanized commercial area.
21 35. The California Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9 in 9 response to the COVID-19
22 pandemic on April 6, 2020, suspending all statutes of limitations for 90 days until after the Governor has
23 lifted the state of emergency related to the pandemic. Subsequently, on May 29, 2020, Emergency Rule

24 9 was amended to state that in cases with statutes of limitation of 180 days or less, the statutes of

25 limitation are "tolled from April 6, 2020, until August 3, 2020."

26 36. This action is filed within 35 days of August 3, 2020.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq; Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)

37. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
4 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
5 38. CEQA requires environmental review and analysis prior to the approval of discretionary
6 projects by state agencies. The Legislature has declared that CEQA supports numerous state policies for
7 "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future...." (Pub.
8 | Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).) "It is the intent of the Legislature that all agencies of the state
9 government which regulate activities of private individuals, corporations, and public agencies which are
10 found to affect the quality of the environment, shall regulate such activities so that major consideration
11 is given to preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent home and satisfying living
12 environment for every Californian." (Id., subd. (g).) Long-term protection of the environment is a
13 fundamental criterion of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (g).)
14 39. The basic purposes of CEQA are to inform governmental decision makers and the public
15 about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities, identify ways that
16 environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced, prevent such damage by the imposition
17 of mitigation measures or the adoption of alternative activities that avoid such damage, and disclosure to
18 the public of the reasons for approving an activity with significant, unmitigable environmental effect.
19 (CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a).)
20 40. CEQA defines "project" as any activity which may cause either a direct physical change
21 or a reasonably foresecable indirect change in the environment, and which involves the issuance by one
22 or more public agencies of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use. (Pub.
23 Resources Code, § 21065.) CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or
24 approved by public agencics. (Pub. Resources Code, § 20180.)
25 41. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects, called categorical exemptions, which are
26 exempt from the provisions of CEQA. (Public Resources Code, § 21084, subd. (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit.
27 14, §§ 15300, 15354.)
28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

b 42.

2 Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and "[e]xemption categories are not to be

3 expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Mountain Lion Foundalion v. Fish

4 & Game Com. (1976) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.) A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce all

5 legislatively mandated CEQA requirements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52
Cal.3d 553, 564.)

6 43.

7 In addition to the limitation that categorical exemptions be narrowly construed, CEQA

8 also provides several exceptions to categorical exemptions. One is that an exemption is inapplicable
"when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
9 significant." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2(b).)

10 44.

11 Another exception to the categorical exemption is that an exemption "shall not be used

12 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will a have a significant effect on

13 the environment due to unusual circumstances." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2(c).) The

14 requirements for this exception are satisfied if a party objecting to a categorical exemption establishes

15 either that "the project has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the exempt class, such as its

16 size or location[;]" or presents "evidence that the project will have a significant environmental effect."

17 (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)

45.

18 If an agency determines that a project is it exempt, it must file a Notice of Exemption

19 setting forth for the public the basis of a claimed exemption. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. § 14, § 15062.) Ifa
project is not found to be exempt, the agency may prepare an Initial Study to determine if the project
20 may have a significant

21 effect on the environment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063.) If there is

22 substantial evidence that a any aspect of a project may cause a significant effect on the environment, the

23 agency must prepare an EIR analyzing the potential impacts, individually and cumulatively, of the
project on the environment.

24 46.

25 The City relied upon the CEQA categorical exemption for existing facilities (Cal. Code

26 Regs., tit. 14, § 15301.) "Class 1 consists to the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing,

27 licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or

28 topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of existing or former use. .
consideration is whether the project involves negligible or no expansion of use." The key

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

I 47. The regulations provide examples of projects that would fit within the Class 1 exemption,

2 including "interior or exterior alterations involving such things as interior partitions, plumbing, and

3 electrical conveyances," "subdivision of existing commercial or industrial building where no physical

4 changes occur which are not otherwise exempt," and "additions to existing structures provided that the

5 addition will not result in an increase of more than 50 percent of the floor area of the structures

6 before the addition or 2,500 square feet, whichever is less; or 10,000 square feet [in specific
7 I circumstances]."

48. The project does not meet the requirements for the Class 1 categorical exemption because

9 it involves a significant expansion of use. The conversion of a fast-food restaurant without an alcohol

10 license to a part of a late-night full-service alcohol serving premises, with later hours of operation than

11 previously authorized, constitutes a significant change in use.

12 49. In addition, the project falls within both the cumulative effects and the unusual
13 circumstances exceptions.

14 50. The project is one of many restaurants in the City that operate with a closing hour of

15 midnight or earlier and which have a license to serve alcohol. Allowing operation until 1:00 a.m. at all

16 such restaurants would significantly increase noise volumes over the baseline of noise at the 1:00 a.m.

17 hour. Real Party in Interest itself owns a neighboring restaurant, Fishing with Dynamite. The project

18 represents the leading edge of efforts to open additional restaurants into late night hours. If each project

19 is viewed individually, perhaps its impacts would seem more limited, but viewed together, the impacts

20 will magnify.

21 51. The project also falls within the exception for unusual circumstances. Petitioners

22 presented evidence that the volume of noise from the project would exceed the City's noise threshold in

23 several respects, thereby creating a significant environmental impact. The project also is unusual in the
24 context of the City of Manhattan Beach for its proximity to residential uses and its late hours of
25 operation.

26 52. For these reasons, the City Council's reliance upon the 1 Class 1 categorical exemption to
27 CEQA was improper and Resolution 20-0049, the approval that relies upon this exemption, is invalid.

24 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)

61.
25 Petitioners incorporate by reference all of the allegations of the previous paragraphs as
though fully set forth herein.

27 Manhattan Beach Municipal Code section 10.84.100 provides that a request for changes

28 in the conditions governing a use permit is reviewed in the same manner as a request for a new use

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATOR Y RELIEF

H permit. Accordingly, Respondents were required to make the findings specified in Manhattan Beach

2 Municipal Code section 10.84.060:
"1. The proposed location of the use is in accord with the objectives of this title
† and the purposes of the district in which the site is located;
2. The proposed location of the use and the proposed conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will be consistent with the General Plan; will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare of persons residing or working on the proposed project site or in or adjacent to the neighborhood of such use; and will not be detrimental to properties or improvements in the vicinity or to the general welfare of the city;
3. The proposed use will comply with the provisions of this title, including any specific condition required for the proposed use in the district in which it would 9 be located; and

10 4. The proposed use will not adversely impact nor be adversely impacted by

11 nearby properties. Potential impacts are related but not necessarily limited to: traffic, parking, noise, vibration, odors, resident security and personal safety,

12 and aesthetics, or create demands exceeding the capacity of public services and facilities which cannot be mitigated."

13 63. Manhattan Beach Municipal Code section 10.68.030, subdivision (h), provides that "[n]o
14 use which fails to meet the performance standards of section 10.60.120 shall be enlarged or extended, or
15 shall have equipment that results in failure to meet required conditions replaced unless the enlargement,

16 extension, or replacement will result in elimination of nonconformity with required conditions."

17 64. Manhattan Beach Municipal Code section 10.60.120, subdivision (a) provides that "All
18 uses and activities shall comply with the provision of the Manhattan Beach Noise Regulations (Chapter

19 5.48 of this Code)."

20 65. Chapter 5.48 explains that "[i]n order to control unnecessary, excessive, and annoying
21 noise in the City of Manhattan Beach, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the City to prohibit such

22 noise generated from or by all sources as specified in this ordinance." Moreover:

23 "It shall be the policy of the City to maintain and preserve the quiet atmosphere of the City, to

24 implement programs aimed at retaining ambient noise levels throughout the City, and to mitigate

25 noise conflicts. It is determined that certain noise levels are detrimental to the public health,

26 welfare and safety, and are contrary to the public interest. Therefore, creating, maintaining,
27 causing, or allowing to be created, caused, or maintained, any noise a in a manner prohibited by

28

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

F the provisions of this chapter is a public nuisance and shall be punishable as such." (M.B.M.C.

2 5.48.010.)

3 66. The City's Noise Ordinance does not limit its regulation of noise to certain types of

4 sound, but rather defines noise broadly as "an unwanted sound which is generally random in nature."

5 (M.B.M.C. 5.48.020.) A "noise disturbance" is "any noise which, as judged by a City employee or

6 contractor that annoys or disturbs a reasonable person or exceeds the standards set forth in this chapter."

7 Petitioners' expert testified that the operations of the business will exceed the standards set forth in the

8 Municipal Code in several respects. The City conducted no analysis of its own of the noise impacts.

9 67. In spite of the evidence of non-compliance, Respondents granted additional hours and

10 expanded use, contrary to the provisions of the Municipal Code.

11 68. Under Government Code section 65009, an action that seeks "to attack, review, set aside,

12 void, or annul any decision on the matters listed in Sections 65901 and 65903, or to determine the

13 reasonableness, legality, or validity of any condition attached to a variance, conditional use permit, or

14 any other permit" must be filed and served within 90 days of the local government's action. This action

15 is timely filed within 90 days of August 3, 2020, as required by Emergency Rule 9.

16 69. Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in the action herein and have exhausted

17 all other available remedies.

18 70. Petitioners a have a beneficial right to Respondents' performance of their respective duties

19 based on Petitioners' interest in maintaining and improving the quality of the urban infrastructure in the

20 City, as well as the interest of Petitioners' members in improving quality of life in their own city,

21 71. Respondents' actions in approving the expanded hours and use at the Premises has

22 caused and threatens to cause Petitioners irreparable and substantial harm.

23 72. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, in that unless this Court

24 enjoins the Real Parties, they will operate for extended hours and hold additional Special Events in

25 reliance upon an invalidly expanded Conditional Use Permit. No amount of monetary damages or other

26 legal remedy can adequately compensate Petitioners for the irreparable harm that Petitioners, their

27 members, and the residents of the City of Manhattan Beach will suffer from the violations of law

28 described herein.

- THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of CPRA (as to Respondent City of Manhattan Beach)

3 (Government Code, § 6258; Code of Civil Procedure, § 1085

73.
4 Petitioners incorporate by reference all of the allegations of the previous paragraphs, as
though fully set forth herein.
5 74.

6 On May 26, 2020, Petitioner McPherson submitted a request to Manhattan Beach City

7 Clerk Liza Tamura for a document staff referred to during the May 5, 2020 appeal hearing for MB
Post, which was identified by staff as "supplemental report."
75.
9 On June, 9, 2020, Petitioner McPherson requested a response to his May 26, 2020

10 request. Petitioner McPherson submitted a request on the same date to City Clerk Tamura seeking "all

11 use-permit resolutions" for the MB Post property, "dating to when a U.S. Post Office occupied the

12 site." The request specifically identified Resolution CC 513, dated October 19, 1999.

76.
13 Petitioner McPherson received no response to either request.

77.
14 On August 10, 2020, counsel for Petitioner emailed Ms. Tamura, forwarding the two

15 prior requests from Petitioner McPherson and requesting a response. No response has been provided as
of September 2, 2020.
16 78.
17 Under the CPRA, "public records" includes any writing containing information relating

18 to the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency

19 regardless of physical form or characteristics.

79.
20 The CPRA defines "local agency" as "a county; city, whether general law or chartered;

21 city and county; school district; municipal corporation; district; political subdivision; or any board
commission or
22 agency thereof; other local public agency; or entities that are legislative bodies of a

23 local agency pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.
80.
24 Under the CPRA, "writing" means any handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating,

25 I photographing, transmitting by electronic mail or facsimile, and every other means of recording upon

26 any tangible thing any form of communication or representation, including letters, words, pictures,

27 sounds, or symbols, or combinations thereof, and any record thereby created, regardless of the manner
in which the record has been stored.
28

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- 81.

2 Government Code section 6253, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part, that: "Except

3 with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law, each state or local

4 agency, upon a request a for a copy of records that reasonably describes an identifiable record or records,

5 shall make the records promptly available to any person upon payment of fees covering direct costs of
duplication, or a statutory fee if applicable."

6 82.

7 All records sought by Petitioner McPherson were prepared, owned, used, or retained by

8 the City, and are, therefore, deemed to be public records pursuant to Government Code section 6252,
subdivision (e).

9 83.

10 Government Code section 6253, subdivision (c) requires that "[eJach agency, upon a
request for a copy of records, shall within 10 days from receipt of the request, determine whether the

11

12 request, in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the agency

13 and shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefor."

84.

14 Although Government Code section 6253, subdivision (c) allows the 10 days to be

15 extended under certain circumstances, subdivision (d) clarifies that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be

16 construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records."

85.

17 The People of the State of California have elevated the right to open government to one

18 protected by their State Constitution. The California Constitution, Article I, Section 3, Paragraphs (a)-
(b) states:

19

20 The people have the right to instruct their representatives, petition government for redress of

21 grievances, and assemble freely to consult for the common good.

22 The people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's

23 business, and therefore, the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and
agencies shall be open to public scrutiny.

24

25 A state, court rule, or other authority, including those in effect on the effective date of this

26 subdivision, shall be broadly construed if it furthers the people's right of access, and narrowly
construed if it limits the right of access.

27 86. The City has failed to respond as required by the CPRA.

28 87. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies. Petitioner McPherson has

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- requested copies of disclosable public records and information from the City, but the City has not

2 responded to repeated requests. The only plain, speedy, and adequate remedy left to Petitioner is the

3 relief provided by Government Code section 6258.

4 88. Government Code section 6258 provides that "[a]ny person may institute proceedings

5 for injunctive or declarative or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce his or

6 her right to inspect or to receive a copy of any public record or class of public records under this

7 chapter.

8 89. Government Code section 6259 provides that "[w]henever it is made to appear by

9 verified petition to the superior court of the county where the records or some part thereof are situated

10 that certain public records are being improperly withheld from a member of the public, the court shall

11 order to the officer or person charged with withholding the records to disclose the public record or

12 show cause why he or she should not do so. The court shall decide the case after examining the record

13 in camera, if permitted by subdivision (b) of Section 915 of the Evidence Code, papers filed by the

14 parties and any oral argument and additional evidence as the court may allow."

15 90. The City has a ministerial duty to perform according to the laws of the State of

16 California, including the CPRA.

17 91. Petitioner has an interest in having the laws executed and public duties enforced, and

18 therefore, has a beneficial interest in the outcome of the proceedings.

19 92. Petitioner has a clear, present, and legal right to the City's performance of its ministerial

20 dutics, as required by the CPRA.

21 93. The City has a present legal a duty and present ability to perform its ministerial duties, as

22 required by the CPRA.

23 94. The City has failed to perform its ministerial duties as required by the CPRA,

24 95. Through this action to enforce the CPRA, Petitioner seeks no greater relief than would

25 be afforded to any other member of the public.

26 96. Therefore, this Court should find that the records and information requested by

27 Petitioner are disclosable public records and that the City has violated the CPRA by refusing to release

28

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

these records, and should order the City to immediately release unredacted copies of all responsive

2 public records.

3 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Declaratory Relief
4 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1060)

5 97. Petitioners incorporate by reference all of the allegations of the previous paragraphs, as
6 though fully set forth herein.
7 98. A dispute has arisen between Petitioners and Respondents, in that Petitioners believe
8 and contend, for the reasons set forth above, that Respondents' actions as set forth above were unlawful
9 and invalid. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis contend, that Respondents contend
10 in all respects to the contrary.
11 99. Petitioners contend that a Class 1 categorical exemption was improper and that the
12 project should not have been approved under the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code because of its noise
13 impacts. Petitioners are informed and believe that in response to Petitioners having identified these
14 issues for Respondents, Respondents have disagreed with Petitioners' contentions.
15 100. Petitioners contend that the City has not complied with the CPRA by failing to respond
16 to Petitioner McPherson's request for identifiable records. Petitioners are informed and believe that in

17 response to Petitioners having identified this issue for Respondents, that Respondents have disagreed
18 with Petitioners' contentions.

19 101. A judicial declaration as to the legality of Respondents' actions, as set forth above, is
20 therefore necessary and appropriate to determine the respective rights and duties of the parties.
21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:
23 1. As to the First Cause of Action, that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate
24 commanding Respondents to rescind Resolution 20-0049 for failure to comply CEQA; and that this
25 Court issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, administrative stay, and permanent
26 injunction enjoining Respondents and Real Parties from operating pursuant to the expanded use and
27 hours granted in Resolution 20-0049;
28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

2. As to the Second Cause of Action, that this a Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate
2 commanding Respondents to rescind Resolution 20-0049 for failure to comply with the requirements of

3 the Municipal Code; and that this Court a issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,

4 administrative stay, and permanent injunction enjoining Respondents and Real Parties from operating

5 pursuant to the expanded use and hours granted in Resolution 20-0049;

6 3. As to the Third Cause of Action, that this Court issue a writ of mandate ordering

7 Respondent City of Manhattan Beach to perform as required by the California Public Records Act and

8 to immediately release the requested records to Petitioners.

9 4. As to the Fourth Cause of Action, that this Court issue declaratory relief that Resolution

10 20-0049 improperly expanded the entitlement to use the premises because Respondents failed to comply

11 with CEQA and the Municipal Code, and that Respondents have failed to comply with the CPRA by

12 failing to respond to Petitioner McPherson's request for records, and that the records requested are

13 public record that are not exempt from disclosure;

14 5. That this Court award Petitioners costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil

15 Procedure section 1021.5, Government Code section 6259, or other applicable law; and

16 6. That this Court grant Petitioners such other, different, or further relief as the Court may

17 deem just and proper.
