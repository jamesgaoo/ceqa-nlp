Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 2

1 2. Section 9 of RESOLUTION 2020- Approved and Adopted by the Moreno Valley City Council on June 16, 2020 also included: REPEAL OF
2 RESOLUTION NO. 2015-56 "That Resolution No. 2015-56 which certified the previous Final EIR and adopted findings, the MMRP and the Statement of
3 Overriding Considerations, is hereby repealed and set aside as ordered by Hon.

4 Judge Waters in the Peremptory Writ of Mandate dated June 12, 2018 (Case No: RIC 1510967 [MFJ)

5 3• The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report for the World
6 Logistics Center is the second attempt by the City of Moreno Valley to comply with the Riverside County Superior Court Judgment and Peremptory Writ of
7 Mandate setting aside the August 2015 Final Environmental Impact Report

8 (FEIR) for the World Logistics Center (WLC). The subject Revised Final Environmental Impact was preceded by the July 2018 Revised Sections of the FEIR (RSFEIR) circulated to the public for review and comment by the City of Moreno Valley. The July 2018 RSFEIR and the City's responses to public
10 comments on that document are incorporated into the subject Revised Final Environmental Impact Report.
11

12 4. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the "take" (Kill, capture or habitat destruction) of listed endangered or threatened species. In a like
13 manner, the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) prohibits the "take" of endangered or threatened species listed by the California Fish and Game
14 Commission. Under the 2004 Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) / Natural Communities Conservation Plan
15 (NCCP Act) the "take" of 146 plant and animal species is permitted for 75 years throughout western Riverside County, in exchange for the assembly and 16 management of coordinated MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Areas. The most
17 prominent Conservation Area is the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) located immediately on the
18 southern boundary of the proposed World logistics Center (WLC).

19 5. Both the federal and state endangered species statutes provide for exceptions to their "take" prohibitions. The federal exception requires applicants to submit a 20 Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). If approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
21 Service, the applicant will be issued an incidental "take" permit (the MSHCP). The California "take" exception is authorized pursuant to the
22 Natural Community Conservation Planning Act (Fish and Game Code §§ 2800- 2835). After approval of a NCCP Act Conservation Plan, the CDFW permits the
23 "take" of covered species whose conservation and management is provided for in the NCCP approved by CDFW. The NCCP Act section 2826 provides: "Nothing
24 in this chapter exempts a project proposed in a natural community planning

25 area from Division 13 (commencing with section 21000) of the Public Resources Code [CEQA - California Environmental Quality Act] or otherwise alters the
26 applicability of that division.'

Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 3

6. In performing the necessary/required analysis of the WLC impacts on Biological Resources the City of Moreno Valley must acknowledge/recognize the
2 City is a signatory to the 1995 Stephens' Kangaroo Rat Habitat Conservation Plan (SKRHCP) and the 2004 Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan 3 (MSHCP/NCCP). Most importantly, the City of Moreno Valley must

4 acknowledge/recognize the San Jacinto Wildlife Area (SJWA) immediately adjacent to the southern boundary of the World logistics Center project site, is
5 the principle designated Conservation Area/Reserve for both of these "take" permits. Both the initial August 2015 Final EIR and the subject Revised Final
6 Environmental Impact Report failed to address the mandatory significant impact of the "take" of MSHCP Covered Species (CEQA Guideline §
7 15065(a)(1)(3)) in accordance with the mandates of CEQA.
7. The subject Revised Final EIR fails to follow the substantives mandates of
9 CEQA and consequently fails to require adoption of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would lessen or avoid significant impacts to Biological
10 Resources. Petitioners accordingly request that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §g 1085 and 1094-5 directing
11 Respondent to vacate and set aside the approvals of the WLC Project and certification of the Revised Final EIR.
12

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094-5,
15 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
16

17 9. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because Respondent and the proposed site of the WLC Project are located in Riverside
18 County.

19 THE PARTIES

7 affected if the Project proceeds. Petitioners would continue to be prejudiced by

8 the project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition.

9 13. Respondent CITY OF MORENO VALLEY was incorporated in 1984 as a
10 general law city. A council-manager government governs the City. The City is divided into five districts, each of which elects a representative to the City
11 Council. On June 16, 2020 the Moreno Valley City Council voted to approve the

1 17. Does 21-50, inclusive, are persons presently unknown to petitioners and who have a legal interest in the project being challenged herein, or are real property
2 owners, developers, or others with a legal or equitable interest in the real property at issue herein. Petitioner will amend this petition to specifically identify
3 each such respondent as required and as capacity and identity of each such respondent becomes known. 4

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 18. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in
7 paragraph 1 through 17 inclusive.

co 19. The public lands of the San Jacinto Wildlife Area immediately south and
9 contiguous with the WLC Specific Plan southern boundary were acquired by the Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB) in fee simple in May 2001. The WCB
10 minutes of May 18, 20011 indicates the acquisition of these public lands were funded using the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean Air and Coastal
11 Protection Bond Act of 2000 (Proposition 12).

12 20. The May 18, 2001 WCB minutes indicate funding for these SJWA wildlife
13 conservation lands was made pursuant to Proposition 12 § 5096.350 (a)(3) T &E for the restoration or acquisition from a willing seller a of habitat for threatened
14 and endangered species or for the purpose of promoting the recovery of those species. Proposition 12 made the funds available for the expenditure by the WCB
15 for "acquisition, development, rehabilitation, restoration and protection of real property benefiting fish and wildlife, for the acquisition, restoration, or
16 protection, of habitat that promotes the recovery of threatened, endangered or

17 fully protected species, maintain the genetic integrity of wildlife populations and serves as corridors linking otherwise separate habitat to prevent habitat
18 fragmentation..".

19 21. The Western Riverside County Regional Conservation Authority (RCA) was
created in 2004 to implement the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
20 (MSHCP). The MSHCP impetus is to assure the conservation of 146 species of
21 plants and animals on designated reserve lands [the SJWA is the most significant
MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Reserve] in order to mitigate the "take" [loss] of
22 species incidental to the development of lands not designated for MSHCP/NCCP conservation. Similarly, the SKR Habitat Conservation Plan [state and federal
23 endangered species "take" permits] includes the SJWA as a primary "Core" reserve to mitigate the incidental habitat impact resulting from the development
24 of lands not designated for SKR conservation.

25

27 Submitted with Petitioner's comment letters on the Draft EIR, April 5, 2013 and the Final EIR, June 9, 2015 for
inclusion in the administration record.

28
6 Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek

1 22. Of the 1.26 million acres covered by the MSHCP/NCCP, 500,000 acres are designated for wildlife conservation. Of that half million acres, 347,000 acres
2 were already conserved as public or quasi-public land. The acquisition of the remaining 153,000 acres [additional Reserve Lands] for MSHCP/NCCP wildlife
3 conservation is the primary function of the RCA. After the 2004 approval of the MSHCP/NCCP, the 2001 WCB Proposition 12 SJWA land acquisition of 4 approximately 1,000 acres was immediately included in the MSHCP/NCCP Conservation Area and counted as Additional Reserve Lands. 5

6 23. In February 2012 the CEQA Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the initial WLC Draft EIR [the Draft/Final EIR the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate subsequently
7 repealed and set aside] was circulated to the public, Trustee and Responsible

cO agencies for comment. Petitioners March 22, 2012 NOP response letter advised the City of Moreno Valley that the NOP was deceptive in that the WLC Specific
9 Plan wrongly identified the public lands acquired by the WCB in May 2001 as the CDFW Conservation Buffer Area. Similarly, the March 22, 2012 NOP
10 response letter from the California Department of Fish and Game?, the state agency having jurisdiction by law over fish and wildlife resources, advised the
11 City of Moreno Valley regarding the defective Project description, the need for compliance with the requirements of CEQA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP and the 12 incidental "take" permits for endangered, threatened and/or candidate species
13 (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.).

14 24. The initial Draft EIR [repealed and set aside by the June 12, 2018 Writ of Mandate] was released for public and agency review in February 2013. The
15 CEQA review presented by the City of Moreno Valley and the Project proponent fashioned straw man fallacies using the "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" and 16 the proposed SJWA "Open Space" designation. In doing so they sought to avoid
17 addressing the mandatory significant impacts to biological resources the WLC project will realize. The straw man fallacies were presented in the EIR to avoid
18 the required CEQA consideration of significant impacts to the public lands of the SJWA, The MSHCP, the SKRHCP, and the wildlife conservation mandates of the
19 state of California.

20 25. The Revised Final Environmental Impact Report (Draft Recirculated

21 RSFEIR), the subject of this CEQA challenge, misrepresents the 2018 Ruling on the Peremptory Writ of Mandate wrongly asserting:
22 "The Judge found that substantial portions of the FEIR did comply with CEQA
23 so that, only portions of the RSFEIR had to be circulated for public review and comment."(Draft Recirculated RSFEIR pages 2-2 and 2-3) 24 No such assertion occurs anywhere in Judge Waters ruling. To the contrary 25 Judge Waters ruling specifically states:
26

27 The Department's name was changed to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) on January 1, 2013.

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 7

1 "In issuing this writ and its February 8, 2018 Ruling, the Court does not make
2 the required finding, including finding of severability, under Public Resources Code section 21168.9(b) partially limiting this writ to a portion of a 3 determination, finding, or to the specific activity or activities found to in noncompliance. For these reasons, the EIR is voided in whole." 4 [emphasis added] (June 14, 2018 Peremptory Writ of Mandate).
26. The City of Moreno Valley assertion that only portions of the RSFEIR had to
6 be circulated for public review and comment is false. The City's current falsehood is analogous to the City's use of the term "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" in
7 the analysis of the Biological Resource section of the challenged 2015 Final EIR.

8 The Court ruling on the Writ of Mandate agrees the City's analysis "distorts CEQA analysis of the impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources and
9 habitats on the adjacent San Jacinto Wildlife Area and Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) lands."The court agrees
10 the "false labeling" .... "gives the false impression that the area [CDFW Conservation Buffer] can be considered mitigation of significant impacts on 11 biological resources and habitat." Most importantly the Court orders all

12 references to the false "CDFW Conservation Buffer Area" should be removed and the ".potential environmental impacts on biological resources and habitats
13 should be re-analyzed without any consideration of said buffer area.' [emphasis added] (February 8, 2018 Ruling on Peremptory Writ of Mandate)
14 27. The City of Moreno Valley has yet to re-analyze the direct, indirect and
15 cumulative impacts of the WLC Project on Biological Resources. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies since the initiation of the WLC Project in 16 2012 by submitting written and oral comments to the City of Moreno Valley prior
17 to the Project approvals to request compliance with CEQA and the completion of a full and adequate environmental review. All issues raised in this petition were
18 raised before Respondent by Petitioners, other members of the public, or public agencies prior to the approval of the project.
19 28. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167-5 by
20 prior service of a notice upon the City of Moreno Valley indicating its intent to file this petition. Proof of Service of this notification with the notification, is attached 21 as Exhibit A.

22 29. Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-
23 captioned proceedings or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to
24 Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.

25 30. Petitioners have served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's
26 office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is
27 attached as Exhibit C.

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 8

1 31. Petitioners have filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied
2 with Pub. Res. Code 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D.

3 32. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code

4 section 21167 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112.

5 33• Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the following ways:
6

7
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION VIOLATION OF CEQA (PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000, et seq.)

9 The City of Moreno Valley did not Comply with CEQA

10 34• Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
11 35• In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature
12 declared it is the policy of the state to: "prevent the elimination of fish and wildlife species due to man's activities, insure that fish and wildlife populations 13 do not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generation
14 representatives of all plant and animal communities..." (Public Resources Code § 21001(c)). "Public agencies should not approve projects if there are feasible
15 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures, which would substantially lessen significant environmental effects of such projects, and that the
16 procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in

17 systematically identifying both the significant effects of the proposed project and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will
18 avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002). The purpose of an Environmental Impact
19 Report (EIR) is to identify the Significant effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in which those
20 significant effects can be mitigated or avoided.' [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21002.1(a).
21

22 36. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that Complies with the requirements of the Statute. The Lead agency must also provide for
23 public review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that
24 decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects. The City of Moreno Valley certification of the WLC
25 Revised Final Environmental Impact Report constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

26 discretion. …the policy of the state that noncompliance with the information disclosure provisions of this division [CEQA] which precludes relevant
27 information from being presented to the public agency, or noncompliance

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 9

with substantive requirements of this division, may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion... [emphasis added] (Public Resources Code § 21005(a)).
2 37. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is
3 inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Respondents:

4 a. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the projects impacts on the
5 environment, including but not limited to, the project's impacts on Biological Resources, the San Jacinto Wildlife Area, the MSHCP and the SKRHCP.
6 b. Failed to provide a stable, consistent and adequate description of the project,
7 which prohibited an accurate depiction of the project's impacts on the environment.
8
C. Failed to provide an adequate description of existing environmental settings of 9 the project, vicinity, and regional context.
10 d. Failed to adopt a consistent and appropriate environmental "baseline" for
11 analysis of the project's environmental impacts that contributed to the EIR's flawed analysis of environmental impacts.
12
e.
13 Failed to adequately identify and analyze the project's biological resource impacts-including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the SJWA, the
14 MSHCP, the SKRHCP and wildlife resources.

15 f. Failed to adequately identify, analyze and adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives that would minimize direct, indirect and cumulative impacts
16 on biological resources.

17 g. Improperly relied upon regional plans to avoid full disclosure and mitigation of
18 the project's impacts.

19 h. Improperly deterred impact analysis and mitigation measures in contravention of CEQA requirements that mitigation measures be clearly defined and
20 enforceable.

21 i. Failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or avoid
22 significant impacts in direct contravention of CEQA substantive mandate that all feasible mitigation measures be adopted to avoid or reduce a project's significant
23 and potentially significant impacts.

24 j. Failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by improperly dismissing feasible alternatives, including those recommended by the public, trustee and 25 responsible agencies and relying upon an improperly narrow list of project
26 objectives to justify the elimination of feasible alternatives.

27

28
Petition for Writ of Mandate Pet. Paulek 10

1 k. Failed to properly disclose, analyze or mitigation conflicts with existing local, state and federal laws.
2 l. Failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by the public and
3 governmental agencies during review of the EIR.

4 m. Failed to recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR, despite the availability of
5 significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.
6
n. Failed to adopt an adequate Mitigating Monitoring and Reporting Program in
7 order to assure that the mitigation measures and program revisions identified in the EIR are implemented.

0.
9 Failed to adopt adequate findings that alternatives to the project and proposed mitigation measures and alternatives that would have avoided or lessened the
10 significant impacts of the project were infeasible and failed to disclose the readily available mitigation measures and alternatives that would meet the basic
11 project objectives.

12 38. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
13 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification
14 of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

Letter to: Moreno Valley City Council, City of Moreno Valley

Re: Notice of Intent to file Suit pursuant to Public resources Code section
21167.5

On the party identified below in the following manner:
