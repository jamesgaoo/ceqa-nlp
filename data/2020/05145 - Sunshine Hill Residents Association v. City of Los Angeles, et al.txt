VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, SUNSHINE HILL RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION ("Petitioner"), alleges:

2 1. The project is a proposed single-family dwelling on an undeveloped property
3 located at 11472 West Laurelcrest Drive, Los Angeles, CA ("Project"). The Project involves the
4 construction of a two-story single-family residence measuring approximately 3,800 square feet
5 with an approximate 2,850 square feet footprint on a vacant lot measuring 10,830 square feet.

6 The Project is located on a never-before developed steep hillside at 11472 West Laurelcrest
7 Drive in the hills of Studio City (which is within the Santa Monica Mountains). The is vacant site is
8 a beautiful, untouched hillside that is home to a sensitive natural community. The property
9 contains nine Coast Live Oak trees including one dead Southern California Black Walnut
10 Among other things, the Project requires the removal of six protected oak trees and the issuance
11
8 of a Tree Removal Permit from the City of Los Angeles. Channel Law 'dnois d77 LZ06 SI!!H 1 IS APNE LHU SIM SOICO Beverly 12 2. Petitioner, Sunshine Hill Residents Association ("Petitioner"), is an
13 unincorporated association whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in
14 the hills of Studio City and in the area of Sunshine Hills in particular. Petitioner and its
15 respective members have direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent
16 complies with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members
17 are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project.
18 Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its
19 members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by
20 Respondent's' approval of the Project.
21 3. Respondent, City of Los Angeles (*Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
22 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
24 4. Real Party in Interest, Larry Schlossberg is the owner of the property located at

8 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

9 12. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
10 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the 2 d17 Group, ME7 Channel L1Z06 12 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary 11

SIl!H Áuerag 14 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 -
15 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
16 13. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
17 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
18 environment, and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
19 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation. ] The statutory definition
20 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
21 a *project' as 'the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
22 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the
environment...."* Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora
24 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all 23

Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.

1 18. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 project.

2 The Class 3 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures (which

3 include the construction of one single family dwelling). However, according to the State CEQA
4 Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of this exemption:
5 (a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the

6 project is to be located a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the

7 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
8 classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an
9 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
10 mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
11 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the 2 d11 'dnoJg ME] jeuueyo LZ06 12 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
13 significant. S SUNS "PAIE EIJYSIIM £888 14 A (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity SW!H Beverly 15 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on

18 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
19 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
20 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
21 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

for a project 24 the Government Code.

25 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used
26 which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

1 urban infill project. However, this exemption is not available when there are "unusual

4 20. As explained below, the City erroneously concluded that the Project was eligible
3 5 for the Class 3 and Class 32 categorical exemptions.

21. The Project's Location and Impacts Prevents the City from Utilizing the Class 3
7 Exemption. As explained in the CEQA Guidelines, "a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its 6

8 BUNS "PLa EJIJUS|IM €8C8 13 property is subject to the Plan because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone.
'SIl!H ApaAg 14 The Zone was established by the Legislature via the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act,
15  which is codified at Section 33001 of the Public Resources Code. The Act states as follows:
16

"The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, as 17 defined in Section 33105, is a unique and
18 valuable economic, environmental, agricultural, scientific, educational, and recreational resource that should be held in trust for present and future generations; that, 19 as the last large undeveloped area contiguous to the shoreline within the greater Los
Angeles metropolitan region, comprised of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, it 20 provides essential relief from the urban environment; that it exists as a single
21 ecosystem in which changes that affect one part may also affect all other parts; and that the preservation and protection of this resource is in the public interest."
22

23 23. The Legislature itself declared that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone is
24 a unique and valuable environmental resource that provided essential relief from the urban
25 environment. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act goes on to say the following:

26
*in the absence of a governmental mechanism to perform such evaluations, piecemeal 27 development projects were occurring within the zone which resulted in
the irreplaceable loss of open space and recreational resources, in the physical and 28

1 biological deterioration of air, land, and water systems within the zone, and adversely
affected regional life-support systems, including fish and wildlife, therefore being harmful to the needs of the present and future population of the region."

3
24. The Legislature further declared at PRC Section 33008 that:
4

5 "there are existing problems of substandard lots, incompatible land uses, conflicts with
recreational use, and inadequate resource protection which, in some cases, cannot be 6 addressed in a feasible manner by local government exercise of the police power or
7 federal land acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and that it is necessary to enact the provisions of this division as a complement to the full
8 exercise of the police power by local governments...

have significant effect on the environment. This standard of review was recently outlined in
Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition v. City of Berkeley (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 880. There should
be no doubt that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone comprises an environmental resource of
critical concern. As noted in Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition, a "resource" is a "natural
source of wealth or revenue," or a "natural feature or phenomenon that enhances the quality of

6 human life." The Legislature's explicit findings regarding the characteristics of the Zone in the

7 Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act more than meets this definitional requirement.
8 Further, Petitioner demonstrated during the administrative process that the Project will have :
potentially significant environmental impact even after replacement trees are planted. Petitioner
10 commissioned an expert report and the author concluded that the loss of habitat of a sensitive
11 natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not mitigated by application of the 0948 AA0 M NE H ASIRIOSSO 'SIl!H Auexeg 12 City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

one such exception and states that if there is a "reasonable possibility"
24 of a "significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances," then the categorical 23 Guidelines provides for

report from Land Protection Partners to demonstrate that mere replacement of trees would not

2 reduce the impacts of the Project on biological resources. Notably, the expert concluded that
3 the loss of habitat of a sensitive natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not
mitigated by application of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

32. The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Proposed Mitigation
Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval for the Proiect. Significantly, in
evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on mitigation

8 measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis for
determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection &
10 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.

11 33. The City has sought to deem this project "exempt" from City by way of an 8 d17 *dnoJ5 ME7 jouueuo LLZ06 1A0 MPANE TBH  SIDA OCO SIl!H Ájerg 12 environmental mitigation measure namely, the planting of replacement trees on the property.
13 However, the general requirement to plant replacement trees is not a regulatory compliance
14 measure at all. Rather, it is a discretionary environmental mitigation measure. The City's
15 Protected Tree Ordinance states as follows:
16 "The Board of Public Works or its authorized officer or employee may [r]equire as a
17 condition of a grant of permit for the relocation or removal of a protected tree, that the
18 permittee replace the tree within the same property boundaries by at least two trees of a
19 protected variety included within the definition set forth in Section 46.01 of this Code, in
20 a manner acceptable to the Board."
21 LAMC Section 46.02(c).
22 34. The Ordinance uses the word "may" - not "shall." This is significant. The tree
23 replacements that are traditionally mandated by the Board of Public Works are discretionary
24 environmental mitigation measures. They are not mandatory "regulatory compliance mcasures."
25 The City cannot use a mitigation measure to reach a determination that a project is exempt from
26 CEQA. This is fundamental black letter CEQA law.
27 35. Further, the Grading Division has issued a Geology and Soils Report Approval
28

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Letter for the Project. This letter contains numerous conditions of approval. Many of these

2 conditions are not simply applications of the California Building Code or existing City of Los
3 Angeles regulations. The fact that the Geology Report contains specialized mitigation measures

4 renders the application of a categorical exemption in appropriate and unlawful.

5 36. The Project is Also Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Seeks to Defer

6 Application of Mitigation Measures to Another Date. Additionally, many of the conditions of

7 approval in the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter simply "kick the can" down the road
8 and defer required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
9 37. Conditioning a project on another agency's future review of environmental
10 impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other agency, is
11 insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency that potentially significant impacts will 8 d77 *dnoJO ME7 Channel LLZ06 CAR AAE TH USIRA  R 'SIIH ÁMeAeg mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring 12 be
13 formulation of mitigation measures at a future time violates the rule that members of the public
14 and other agencies must be given an opportunity to review mitigation measures before a project
15 is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See League for Protection of Oakland Architectural &
16| Historic Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896; Gentry v. City of Murrieta

20 306, (condition requiring that mitigation measures recommended by future study to be conducted
21 by civil engincer evaluating possible soil stability, erosion, sediment, and flooding impacts was
22 improper). Morcover, a condition that requires implementation of mitigation measures to be

24 mitigation measures before a proposed negative declaration is released for public review. PRC §
25 21080, subd. (c)(2); 14 Cal Code Regs § 15070(b)(1). Studies conducted after a project's
26 approval do not guarantee an adequate inquiry into environmental effects. Such a mitigation
27 measure would effectively be exempt from public and governmental scrutiny.

1 38. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed prejudicial abuse of
2 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to consider Petitioner's
3 appeal and conduct the required additional environmental analysis under CEQA before
4 approving the Project.
5 39. The Project Site Has Value for Rare, Threatened or Endangered Species. The

6 Southern California Black Walnut is a rare a species and the project site has value as habitat for
7 this species. The project site has such value as evidenced by that the fact that there is a dead
8 Southern California Black Walnut located on the property. Additionally, the project site is home

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; Tree Removal Permit Issued for 11472 West Laurelcrest Drive; Council File # 19-1134

Dear City of Los Angeles:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Sunshine Hill Residents Association ("Petitioner"), intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Los Angeles (City" or "Respondent"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City incorrectly determined that the proposed single-family dwelling and associated tree removal permit located at 11472 West Laurelcrest Drive (Project") was exempt from CEQA. Among other things, the Petition will request that the court direct the City to vacate and rescind the project approvals, the determination that the project is exempt CEQA and to otherwise comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioners' cost and attorneys' fees.
"Ale Jamie T. Hall
