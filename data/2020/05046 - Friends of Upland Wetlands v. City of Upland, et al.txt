FRIENDS OF UPLAND WETLANDS; and DOES CIV DS 2010521

through 10, â€¢ CASE NO,

12 Plaintiffs and Petitioners, VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

13 )DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
VS, RELIEF UNDER THE CALIFORNIA
14 CITY OF UPLAND; and DOES 11 through 100, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AND OTHER LAWS
15 Defendants and Respondents,
16 FH II, LLC; and DOES 101 through 1,000,
17 Defendants and Real Parties in Interest.

18
19 Plaintiff and Petitioner FRIENDS OF UPLAND WETLANDS ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:
20 Parties

21 1. Petitioner is a non-profit, social-advocacy organization formed and operating under the laws

22 of the State of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in or near the City of Upland,
23 California, and has an interest in ensuring open, accountable, responsive government and in protecting the
24 region's environment.
25 2, Defendant and Respondent CITY OF UPLAND ("Respondent") is a public agency under
26 Section 21063 of the Publio Resources Code. Respondent is authorized and required by law to hold public
27 hearings to determine whether the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") applies to development
28 within its jurisdiction, to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental documents prepared pursuant

1 to CEQA, and to determine whether a project is compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses,

2 and programs specified in Respondent's General Plan.

3 3. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that FH II, LLC, is a Real Party
in Interest insofar as it is identified by Respondent as the applicant for the proposed project that is the subject
of this proceeding.

6 4. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents identified as DOES 11 through
100 and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 1,000 are unknown to Petitioner,

8 who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to allege the true name and capacities
as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of the

10 fictitiously named Defendants/Respondents 11 through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects
11 of the proposed project that is the subject of this proceeding and that cach of the fictitiously named
12 Defendants/Real Parties in Interest 101 through 1,000 either claims an ownership interest in the proposed

13 project or has some other cognizable interest in the proposed project.

14 Background Information

15 5. Onor around April 13, 2020, Respondent's city council approved a specific plan, general plan

16 amendment, zone change, tentative tract, site plan, design review, and environmental assessment review, for

17 a proposed residential development located within the common area open space on an existing 9.2-acre

18 portion of the 15th Street flood control detention basin, including modifications to the remainder detention basin

19 (the "Project"). Approval of the Project will result in the construction of 65 single-family detached residential

20 units at a density of7.1 dwelling units per acre. Respondent's approval of the Project was discretionary under
21 CEQA,

22 6. As a result of stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19, the city council meeting on the

23 Project occurred via teleconference. The decision to conduct the meeting by teleconference, along with

24 Respondent's actions leading up the meeting, deprived the public of a full and fair opportunity to be heard on

25 the Project. By way of example and not limitation:

26 A. The Notice of Public Hearing for the Project (the "Notice") informs the public that the

27 meeting on the Project will occur at Upland City Hall. The Notice further states that "[aJll plans, environmental
28 information, and other data pertinent to the proposed project... will be available for inspection prior to the

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 2

public hearing, All interested persons are invited to attend this public hearing and express their opinions for

2 or against the proposal." There is nothing in the Notice regarding how members of the public could attend the

3 teleconference meeting.

4 B. Contrary to the Notice, the public was unable to attend the meeting as it was held by
teleconference. In order to comment on the Project, any member of the public had to register two hours in

6 advance by sending an email to Respondent's City Clerk containing the subject line "PUBLIC COMMENT,"
7 including the caller's name, telephone number, and the meeting date, so that the caller could be telephoned

8 when it was his or her turn to speak at the meeting.

9 C. The decision to hold the meeting by teleconference assumed that everyone who

10 opposed the Project had telephone or internet service to participate in the meeting, even though some of them
11 did not have such service.

12 D. Neither the Notice nor the agenda for the meeting states that Respondent's city council

13 was considering approval of a mitigated negative declaration ("MND") for the Project.
14 7. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by Respondent. In

15 particular, Petitioner secks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the Project on the grounds, among
16 others, that Respondent has violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law (*PZL"), the Upland Municipal
17 Code ("UMC"), and Petitioner's fair-hearing and due-process rights.
18 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations
19 8. This proceeding was commenced not more than 30 days after the notice authorized by Public
20 Resources Code Section 21152(a) was filed (if such a notice was filed).

21 9, Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on Respondent, as

22 required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of
23 Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

24 10. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General not

25 more than ten days after its filing, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21 167.7 and Code of Civil
26 Procedure Section 388.

27

28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 3

1 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

2 11. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code Section

3 21168 or 21168.5, as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq. and 1084 et seq.,

4 among other provisions of law.

12. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law; by way of example,
6 and without limitation, at least one of Petitioner's members participated in the teleconference meeting and
7 voiced its opposition to the Project. Additionally and/or alternatively, Petitioner was not required to exhaust
8 its administrative remedies under the circumstances presented by the Project.

9 13. Respondent's conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA, the PZL, the

10 UMC, and Petitioner's due process and fair hearing rights constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because,
11 as alleged in this pleading, it failed to proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported

12 by substantial evidence.

13 14, Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since its
14 members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondent's violations
15 of CEQA, the PZL, the UMC, and other laws. Respondent's approval of the Project also rests on its failure
16 to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those laws. Even when Respondent is
17 permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in approving projects under those laws, it remains under
18 a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with
19 those laws. Respondent has had and continues to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within

20 the time limits of and in a manner consistent with thosc laws, but Respondent has failed and refuses to do so
21 and has exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

22 15. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all its legal duties, as

23 alleged in this pleading.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: Illegal Approval and Adoption of Project
25 (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

26 16. Paragraphs 1 through 15 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

27 17. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and without
28| limitation (including alternative theories of liability);

VERIPIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 4

1 A. The Project violates CEQA. Specifically:
2 i. Whenever a project proposed to be carried out or approved by a lead agency
3 has the potential to cause an adverse environmental impact, CEQA prohibits the agency from relying on a

4 negative declaration. Instead, CEQA requires the preparation of an environmental impact report to identify

5 and analyze the significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to
6 both short-term and long-term impacts, providing decision-makers with enough information to enable them

7 to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of their actions, and providing

8 members of the public with enough information to participate meaningfully in the project's approval and
9 environmental-review process. CEQA also requires every environmental impact report to identify and analyze

10 a reasonable range of alternatives to a proposed project. CEQA further requires every environmental impact

11 report to identify and analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project's significant adverse
12 environmental impacts. An environmental impact report must be prepared for a proposed project if there is 13 a fair argument, supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, that the project may have an
14 adverse environmental impact; stated another way, a negative declaration may not be used unless the lead
15 agency determines with certainty that there is no potential for the project to have an adverse environmental
16 impact.

17 ii. There is a fair argument that the Project will have significant environmental
18 impacts. By way ofexample and without limitation, the administrative record is replete with evidence that the
19 Project will result in significant biological, traffic, air quality, and aesthetic impacts, among other environmental
20 impacts. The Project will also result in cumulative impacts unaccounted for in the MND.

21 iii. The Project's significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the
22 environment give rise to Respondent's legal obligation to prepare an environmental impact report.

23 iv. Respondent's failure to prepare an environmental impactreport is a violation
24 of CEQA.

25 V, As a result ofRespondent's violation of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed
26 insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public, and the responsible decision-makers were not
27 fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the this Project, and insofar as Petitioner,

28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 5

La

2 its members, and other members of the public did not have an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the

3 analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.

B. The Project violates the PZL. In particular:
i. The PZL prohibits the approval of any project that is not consistent with the
applicable general and specific plans and their components. The Project authorizes land uses and activities
that are in some way inconsistent with the general and specific plans and their components.
ii.

8 Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent failed to make the findings
required for approval of the Project under the PZL.
iii.

10 Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent's approval of the Project was

11 based on findings that are not supported by sufficient evidence in the administrative record.

iv. As a result of Respondent's violation of the PZL, Petitioner, its members, and
12 the general public have been harmed insofar as Respondent has approved a project that is inconsistent with

13

14 the land-use rules designed to protect the public from harmful development.

C.

15 The Project violates the UMC. By way of example and not limitation:

i. The UMC permits the approval of a general plan amendment only if (i) the
16| proposed general plan amendment is in the public interest, (ii) the proposed general plan amendment is
17 consistent and compatible with the rest of the general plan, (iii) the potential effects of the proposed general
18 plan amendment have been evaluated and have been determined not to be detrimental to the public health,

19 safety, or welfare, and (iv) the proposed general plan amendment has been processed in accordance with the
20 applicable provisions of the Government Code and CEQA. The Project's general plan amendment authorizes

21 land uses and activities that are in some way inconsistent with the requirements of the UMC. Additionally
22 and/or alternatively, Respondent failed to make the findings required to support approval of the Project's

23 general plan amendment. Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent's approval of the general plan
24 amendment was based on findings that are not supported by sufficient evidence in the administrative record.

25 ii. The UMC permits the approval of a zoning ordinance only if (i) the proposed
26 amendment is consistent with the general plan and any applicable community or specific plan as provided by

27

28 Government Code Section 65860, and (ii) the proposed amendment will not be detrimental to the public
interest, health, safety, or welfare of the City. The Project's zone change authorizes land uses and activities

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 6

that are in some way inconsistent with the requirements of the UMC. Additionally and/or alternatively,
Respondent failed to make the findings required to support approval of the Project's zone change.
Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent's approval of the zone change was based on findings that are
not supported by sufficient evidence in the administrative record.
iii. The UMC permits the approval of a tract map only if the Project complies with
applicable standards in the zoning ordinance, other City ordinances, the general plan, Subdivision Map Act,
or other applicable community or specific plan, and is also supported by the findings set out in UMC Chapter
17.44.080, subdivision (F). The Project's tentative tract authorizes land uses and activities that are in some

9 way inconsistent with the requirements of the UMC. Additionally and/or alternatively, Respondent failed to
10 make the findings required to support approval of the Project's tentative tract. Additionally and/or
11 | alternatively, Respondent's approval of the tentative tract was based on findings that are not supported by
12 sufficient evidence in the administrative record.

13 iv. UNC Chapter 17.46.020, subdivision (A)(3) states that any notice of public
14 hearing must contain a statement that the hearing body will consider approval of the CEQA determination or
15 document prepared for the proposed project. The Notice fails to state whether the MND for the Project
16 would be up for approval at Respondent's city council mecting.
17 V. As a result of Respondent's violation of the UMC, Petitioner, its members,
18 and the general public have been harmed insofar as Respondent has approved a project that is inconsistent

19 with the land-use rules designed to protect the public from harmful development.

20 18. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Respondent over the Project's legal force

21 and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because it violates CEQA, the PZL,

22 the UMC, and/or one or more other applicable laws. Respondent disputes Petitioner's contention. The
23 parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's legal force and effect (if any).

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:
Violation of Due-Process and Fair-Hearing Rights
25 (Against All Respondents)

26 19. Paragraphs 1 through 18 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
27 20, Basic legal principles governing public hearings require that all participants be provided a fair
28 hearing and that their right to due process not be violated. An elementary and fundamental requirement of due

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 7

process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested
2 parties of the pendency of the action and a fair opportunity to present their objections. Despite these rules,
3 Petitioner did not receive a fair hearing on the Project. By way of example and without limitation:

4 A. The Notice failed to mention the hearing on the Project was by teleconference.

5 B. It was unduly burdensome to participate in the hearing on the Project.

6 C. The decision to hold the meeting by teleconference assumed that everyone who

7 opposed the Project had telephone or internet service to participate in the meeting,
8 D. The decision to hold the meeting in the midst of a pandemic ensured significantly
9 decreased public participation, which is at odds with the well-established public policy of full government
10 transparency and citizen participation in government decision-making,
11 I E. Neither the Notice nor the agenda forthe meeting states that Respondent's city council
12 was considering approval of an MND for the Project.
13 21. Petitioner's fair hearing and due process rights were violated as a result of Respondent's failure
14 to provide a fair hearing on the Project.
15 22. As a result of Respondent's violations of Petitioner's fair hearing and due process rights,
16 Petitioner has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, and the gencral public have been denied the
17 benefits and protections provided by compliance with the law governing Petitioner's fair-hcaring and due-
18 process rights,
19 Prayer

20 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against all
21 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest (and any all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this
22 proceeding):
23 A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed to fully
24 comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and that there must
25 be full compliance therewith before final approval and implementation of the Project may occur;
26 B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed to
27 comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project and that its
28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 8

approval and implementation was illegal in at least some respect, rendering the approval and implementation

2 null and void;

3 C. Injunctive relief prohibiting Respondents (and any and all persons acting at the request of, in

4 concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from taking any action on any aspect of, in furtherance

5 of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA and all other

6 applicable laws, as determined by the Court;

7 D, Any and all other relief that may be authorized by CEQA or other applicable laws, or any

8 combination of them, but is not explicitly or specifically requested elsewhere in this Prayer;
9 E. Any and all legal fees and other expenses incurred by Petitioner in connection with this

10 procceding, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure;

11 and

12 F. Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
