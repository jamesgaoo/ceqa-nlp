3 GENTRAL ALLEGATIONS
4 Local Agency General Plans

5 7. A local agency such as the County is required to have a general plan. (Gov. Code,

6 § 65300 et seq.) A general plan is : "comprehensive, long-term" "plan for the physical development
7 of the county or gity, and of any land outside ity boundaries which in the planning agenoy's
8 judgment bears relation to its planning." (Gov. Code, § 65300.)
8. State law requires a general plan to include certain chapters, or "elements.3 These
10 "mandatory" elements include those relating to land use, housing, safety, and others. (Gov. Code,
11 65302.) A general plan may include other "optional" elements that "relate to the physical
12 development of the county or city." (Gov. Code, § 65303.) A general plan and its elements should
13 "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting
14 agency." (Gov. Code, § 65300.5.) Additionally, an agency's subsequent land use actions must be
15 consistent with its general plan. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, $§ 65359 [specific plans], 66473.5
16 [subdivision maps], 65860 [zoning ordinances].)

17 9. State law provides for procedures, including public notice and heating, for adopting
18 or amending a general plan. (Gov. Code, § 65350 et seq.)

19 The 2040 General Plan

20 10. In or about 2015, the County began preparing the 2040 General Plan, a
21 comprehensive update of its general plan. In 2015, the Board selected a consultant team to prepare
22 the 2040 General Plan in conjunction with County staff. Also in 2015, the Board directed that the
23 2040 General-Plan "should be completed before summer of 2020.3

24 11. The 2040 General Plan includes two documents: a Background Report and the plan
25 itself, often referred to as the Policy Document.

26 12. In March 2017, the County published a draft Background Report that "provides a
27 'snapshot' in time of the County's existing conditions. It presents the physical, social, and economic
28 resource information required to support the preparation of the General Plan. The data and

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 information in the Repoxt have a baseline date of June 2016. The Background Report serves as the
2 foundation document from which subsequent planning policies and programs will be formulated.
3 The document is also used as the 'environmental setting' section of the General Plan EIR.» The

4 County published revised Background Reports in October 2017 and January 2018.

5 13. Petitionerg are informed and belleve, and on that basis allege, that on January 14,
6 2019, the County issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR)
7 and Scoping Meeting for the Ventura County 2040 General Plaa Update ("Notice of Preparation").
8 14. The Notice of Preparation described the 2040 General Plan as "a comprehensive
9 update of its General Plan. The County's current General Plan was most recently updated in 2005
10 and has not been comprehensively updated since 1988. The 2040 General Plan Update is anticipated
11 to be adopted in 2020 and will set forth the County's vision of its future and express the goals,
12 policies, and implementation programs that will guide future decisions concerning a variety of
13 issues, including land use, health and safety, and resource conservation out to the year 2040,3
14 15. The Notice of Preparation characterized the Background Report as "describe[ing]
15 existing conditions as of 2016 and potential future trends in Ventura County. It is divided into 12
16 chapters that cover a wide range of topics, such as demographics, economic conditions, land use,
17 public facilities, and environmental resources."

18 16. The Notice of Preparation charactexized the second component of the 2040 General
19 Plan, the Policy Document, as "the essence of the 2040 General Plan Update. It will set forth the
20 goals and policies that guide future decisions within the unincorpotated areas and will identify the
21 implementation programs required to carry out the goals and policies of the General Plan. The
22 Policy Document will also include land use designations and a land use diagram that specifies the
23 allowable uses of land, (e.g., residential, commercial, etc.) throughout the unincorporated area." The
24 Notice of Preparation also indicated, "The General Plan will address the state's mandatory elements
25 including Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety, plus the
26 new requirements for Air Quality and Environmental Justice, and three new optional elements:
27 Water, Agriculture, and Economio Development."
28 17. The Notice of Preparation also discussed the General Plan's existing and proposed

4
VBRIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 land use designations. According to the Notice of Preparation, "The Proposed 2040 General Plan
2 Update Land Use Designations would refine the Existing Community and Urban land use

3 designations of the existing General Plan to more clearly distinguish among land uses allowed
4 within each designation and set forth maximum development density and intensity standards."
5 18. The Notice of Preparation also indicated that the "2040 General Plan Update will
6 also include updates to seven of the ten Area Plans that are part of the existing General Plan: 1) EI
7 Rio/Del Norte; 2) Thousand Oaks; 3) Lake Sherwood/Hidden Valley; 4) Ojai Valley; 5) Oak Park;
8| 6) Piru; [and] 7) North Ventura Avenue."

9 19. In May 2019, the County released a "preliminary publio review draft" of the 2040
10 General Plan Policy Document. According to this draft, the "Ventura County 2040 General Plan
11 Policy Document is organized into 11 chapters," including one for an introduction, nine for each of
12 the 2040 General Plan's elements, and one for the County's Area Plans.
13 20. In June 2019, the County Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") held work
14 sessions to consider and revise the draft 2040 General Plan.

15. 21. In August 2019, the Board held a work session to consider the draft 2040 General
16 Plan. At that work session, the Board made revisions to the draft General Plan. On September 10,
17 2019, the Board again considered, reviewed the prior revisions to, and made further revisions to the
18 2040 General Plan.

19 22. In January 2020, the County released for public review'a revised draft Background
Demacnnt•. 20 Report. The 1,034-page draft Background Report included chapters on Demographics and
21 Economics; Land Use; Health and Well-Being; Housing; Transportation and Mobility; Public
22 Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure; Natural Resources; Agriculture; Water Resources; Hazards
23 and Safety; and Climate Change. The January 2020 Background Report states, "The data and
24 information in the Background Report have a baseline date of June 2016.3 The January 2020
25 Background Report further states, "The document is also used as the 'environmental setting' section
26 of the General Plan EIR."

27 23. In January 2020, the County also released for public review a "public review draf»
28 of the 2040 General Plan Policy Document. This draft document identified the nine General Plan

20| The 2040 General Plan Final CIR

21 37. On or about July 2, 2020, the County made available for public review the Final
22 Euvironmental Impact Report ("Final EIR.") for the 2040 General Plan. The Final EIR includes the

23 numerous written comments on the Draft EIR from publio agencies, private organizations, and
24 individuals. The Final EIR includes "master responses" to the Draft EIR comments. According to
25 the Final EIR, "Master responses are provided for the following topics: greenhouse gas emissions;

28 1 policies; draft EIR. Mitigation Measure AG-2 for loss of important farmland; the 2040 General Plan

0
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Backgtound Report; and recirculation of the draft EIR." The Final EIR also provided responses to'
2 invidual comments, including those from Petitioners. These responses frequently referred to the
master responses.

4 38. As a result of comments on the Draft EIR, the County revised the Draft EIR, as
5 indicated in section 3 of the Final EIR. The County also provided new information. The Final EIR
6 attaches a new a report entitled "Revised Draft EIR Appendix D GHG Calculations." This report
7 contains a "discussion of revisions to the GHG emission calculations in the Draft BIR" *pursuant to
8 comments made on the draft EXR." The Final EIR. noted, "In response to these comments, two major
9 changes were made to the emissions inventory and forecast estimates.»
10 The 2040 General Plan and Final EIR Public Hearingg
11 39. On July 16, 2020, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing "to consider
12 and provide recommendation to the Board of Supervisors regarding" the 2040 General Plan, the
13 Final EIR, and related items. At that public hearing, the Planning Commission voted 3-1 to
14 recommend that the Board: certify the Final EIR; adopt, with revisions, CEQA-related findings, a
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring Program; repeal the existing
16 General Plan; and approve and adopt the 2040 General Plan and 2040 General Plan Background
17 Report, with revisions.
18 40. The Planning Commission's recommended revisions included the deletion of
19 Mitigation Measures PR-1, PR-2, and PR-3, the only mitigation measures in the Draft EIR designed
20 to mitigate the 2040 General Plan's significant impacts on mineral resources.
21 41. On August 4, 2020, Petitioner's counsel emailed County staff a letter regarding the
22 inadequate circulation of the Draft EIR to State agencies.

23 42. On September 1, 2020, Petitioner's counsel emailed County staff a letter regarding
24 the 2040 General Plan and its Final EIR. That letter stated in part:
25 d. that the Draft EIR was not properly circulated to State agencies under Public
26 Resources Code section 21091 and that the Final BIR'S response to Petitioners'
27 previous comment on the issue was inadequate;
28 b. that the Final EIR. continued to fail to provide adequate information regarding

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 forecasted development build-out under the 2040 General Plan and that the Final

2 EIR's response to Petitioners' previous comment on the issue was inadequate. The
3 letter include examples from other counties in Southern California that provided

4 adequate general plan build-out information in EIRs;

5 C. that the Draft EIR required recirculation under CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5

6 because it was "so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature
that meaningful public review and comment were precluded";
8 d. that the absence of adequate 2040 General Plan build-out information precluded
O adequate analysis in the Draft EIR of the 2040 General Plan's environmental
F 5 impacts, including those related to utilities such wastewater capacity and water
supply;
12 e. that the Final EIR did not adequately clarify whether the 2040 General Plan's
13 proposed land use designations would reduce the maximum density/intensity,
14 minimum lot size, and maximum lot coverage requirements for any properties within
15 the 2040 General Plan area;
16 f that the Final EIR. inadequately considered whether the 2040 General Plan would
17 constrain future housing opportunities within the 2040 General Plan area, a
18 particularly problematic issue given that the County separated the update to its
19 Housing Element from the 2040 General Plan;

20 g. that the Final EIR. inadequately analyzed the 2040 General Plan's impacts on mineral
21 resources, which are themselves part of the "environment" under CEQA. (Pub,
22 Resources Code, § 21060.5.) The letter further noted that the Draft BIR required
23 recirculation after the County improperly and without sabstantial evidence deleted,
24 purportedly for being infeasible, the only proposed mitigation measures (Mitigation
25 Measures PR-1, PR-2, and PR-3) that addressed the 2040 Goneral Plan's significant
26 impacts on mineral resources; and

27 h. that the Final EIR. continued to fail to properly analyze, mitigate for, or avoid the
28 2040 General Plan's foresecable indirect impacts arising from the 2040 Genetal

11
VERIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Plan's limitations on oil and gas production. The letter attached an August 28, 2020,

2 report from Sespe Consulting, Ino. that confirmed that the 2040 General Plan would

3 have a significant adverse impact regarding greenhouse gas emissions arising from

4 the 2040 General Plan's limitations on oil and gas production.

5 43. On September 1, 2020, the Board conduoted a publio hearing to "Consider
6 Certification of the 2040 General Plan Final Environmental Impact Report, Including Adoption of
7 Related Findings and Documents Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Repeal of
8 Existing General Plan Except for the 2014-2021 Housing Element, and Approval and Adoption of

9 the 2040 General Plan and 2040 General Plan Background Report (Planning Division Case Number

10 PL17-0141)."

11 44. On September 1, 2020, the Board voted 3-2 to approve a motion (the "Board
12 Motion") to:

13 a. "Close the publio testimony, tentatively approve the recommended actions on the

14 2040 General Plan, FEIR and related documents, and direct staff to revise these

15 documents as stated below in this motion."

16 b. "Continue Public Hearing to September 15th at 3:00 p.m. for sole purpose of
17 considering final documents.*

18 C. "Staff to provide the final form of the 2040 General Plan, EIR and related documents

19 at continued September 15th Public Hearing."

20 d. "In addition, direct staff to return on September 15th with all information needed for

21 Boatd to consider approval of the creation of a Spanish language translation of the

22 policy portion (Chapters 1 through 10, 12, and Appendix B) of the 2040 General

23 Plan."

24 45. The Board Motion directed County staff to make the following revisions to the 2040

25 General Plan, the Final EIR, or related documents:

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Violations of CEQA; Pub. Resourçes Code, § 21000 et seq.)
20 59. Paragraphs 1 through 58 are incorporated here as if fully set forth herein.
21 60. CEQA is set forth in the Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. Additionally,
22 the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the California Natural Resources Agency
23 together prepare, develop, certify, and adopt the "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal, Code Regs., § 15000
24 et seq.) and amendmnents thereto. The CEQA Guidelines are regulations that clarify, interpret, and
25 implement CEQA,

26 61. Broadly speaking, CEQA directs certain local agencies such as the County to
27| identify and analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts of certain actions, or
28 "projects," so as to inform agoncy decision-makers and the public of the environmental

15
VERIFIED FETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 consequences of a project. An agency undertaking the initial CEQA review of a project, referred to
2 as the "lead" agency, will usually engage in a three-step process. First, the Lead agency determines if
3 the action being considered is a "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.) Second,
4 the lead agency determines if the project is exempt from CEQA. (CEHQA Guidelines, § 15061.)
Third, the lead agency determines whether the project could result in potentially significant
6 environmental impacts, Depending on whether or not there are significant impacts and whether

7 those impacts can be mitigated to a level below significance, a lead agency will prepare a negative
8 declaration, • a mitigated negative declaration, or a full EIR for a project. (CEQA Guidelines,
9 § 15063, subd. (b).)

10 62. CEQA directs public agencies to prepare an EIR "as early as feasible in the planning
11 process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet late
12 enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (CEQA Guidelines,
13 § 15004, subd, (b).) Particularly for public projects sponsored by the lead agency itself, CEQA
14 notes that "public agencies shall not undertake actions concerning the proposed public project that
15 would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,
16 before completion of CEQA compliance." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)
17 63. CEQA imposes substantive and procedural xequirements on agenoies such as the
18 County regarding the preparation, contents, adequacy, public review, and certification of an EIR.
19 64. A lead agency preparing an EIR will start with a draft BIR. (CEQA. Guidelines,
20 § 15084.) A draft EIR must include, among other items:

21 a. a brief summary of the project, its consequences, and its significant impacts (CEQA.
22 Guidelines, § 15123);

23 b. a project description that includes sufficient information for evaluation and review of

24 the onvironmental impacts of the project, including the location of the project, a
1 25 statement of the project objectives, a description of the project's characteristics, a
26 statement briefly describing the intended uses of the EIR, a list of agencies that are
27 expected to use the EIR, and a list of environmental review and consultation

28 requirements (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124);

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 C.

2. a description of the project's "environmental setting," a "description of the physical

3 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project," typically at the time they

4 oxist at the time of the issuance of the project's notice of preparation. The

5 environmental setting "will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by

6 which a lead agenoy determines whether an impact is significant. The description of

+J the environmental setting shall be no longer than is necessary to provide an
understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives."
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15125);

9

10 d. a discussion of the significant environmental impacts of the project, including those

11 that carmot be avoided and those that are irreversible (CEQA Guidelines, $§ 15126,
15126.2);

12 e,

13 the mitigation measures proposed to minimize the project's significant impacts

14 (CEQA Guidelines, §5 15126, 15126.4); and
f.

15 a reasonable range of project alternatives that meet the project's objectives while

16 avoiding or reducing its significant environmental irpacts (CEQA Guidelines,
§§ 15126, 15126.6).

17 65.

18 Once a lead agency has completed the draft EIR, it must file a "notice of

19 completion" of the draft BIR with the Office of Planning and Research. (CEQA Guidelines,
§ 15085.) The lead agency must consult with and request comments on the draft EIR from various
20 public agencies. (CEQA Guidelines, § 156086.) A lead agency must also prepare a "notice of the
21 availability" of the draft EIR to provide the public with notice of the draft EIR as well as the

22

23 opportunity to provide comments on it. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15087.) The public review petiod for

24 a project submitted for review by State agencies, such as the 2040 General Plan, shall be no less
than 45 days. (CHQA Guidelines, § 15105, subd. (a).)

25 66. After public review and comment on a draft EIR, an agency must prepare a final EIR
26 before approving a project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15089.) Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section
27 15132, a final EIR must include:

28 a. the draft ETR or the revised draft EIR;

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 b. the comments received on the draft EIR;

2

3 c. a list of persons, organizations, and public agencies commenting on the draft EIR;
d. the responses to comments prepared by the lead agency; and

4 e. any information added by the lead agency.
67. CEQA requires a lead agency to adequately respond to comments from other
6 agencies and the public on 8

7 § 15088.) draft EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21092.5; CEQA Guidelines,

8 68. Also before approving a project, a lead agency must

10 significant environmental impacts, a

11 lead agency must also make certain findings supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines,
cO2 15091.) If a project will result in one or more significant environmental impacts that will not be
12 mitigated or avoided, a lead agency may only approve the project if it determines that the project's
13

14 benefits "outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects" of the project. Such a "statement

15 of overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence in the reoord." (CEQA
Guidelines, $ 15093.)

16 69.

17 Respondents have violated CEQA by failing to procced in a manner required by law
and by failing to support their determinations or decisions with substantial evidence. (Pub.
18 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) Alternatively, Respondents have violated CEQA by proceeding in
19

20 excess of their juxisdiction and by prejudicially abusing their discretion by failing to proceed in the
manner required by law, by failing to support their decisions with findings, and by failing to support
21 their findings with substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168; Code Civ. Proc.,
22 § 1094.5.)

23 70. Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law and violated CEQA by

- 24 failing to properly circulate the Draft EIR, including in accordance with Public Resources Code
25 section 21091 and CEQA Guidelines section 15087.

26 71,

2 As a result of the foregoing CEQA violations, including the deficiencies in and

3 associated with the Final EIR, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the
