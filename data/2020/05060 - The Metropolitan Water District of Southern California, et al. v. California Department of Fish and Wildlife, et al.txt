FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioners and plaintiffs The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California

2 (*"Metropolitan"), Mojave Water Agency ("Mojave"), Coachella Valley Water District

3 ("Coachella") and San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency ("San Gorgonio"), and petitioner Municipal
4 Water District of Orange County ("MWDOC") allege as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC bring this action to

7 protect their interests in reliable State Water Project ("SWP") supplies by ensuring that any

8 requirement to forego or cut supplies or fund mitigation and monitoring imposed on the SWP to

9 meet California Endangered Species Act ("CESA") requirements is both scientifically and legally

10 justified, by ensuring that the environmental impacts of altering SWP operations are fully

11 disclosed and analyzed consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and

12 by protecting and enforcing Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's

13 respective contractual rights.

14 2. California approved and built the SWP, a system of water storage, diversion and

15 conveyance facilities, primarily to deliver water to farms and cities, but also to provide flood

16 protection and hydroelectric power, and to serve ancillary recreational and fish and wildlife

17 purposes. The SWP is the foundation of California's water supply system. It supplies water that

18 ultimately reaches more than 27 million people in northern California, the Bay Area, the San

19 Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast and southern California, as well as about 750,000 acres of

20 farmland, mainly in the San Joaquin Valley.

21 3. Metropolitan's allocation of SWP water supplies comprises a significant portion of

22 Metropolitan's water supply portfolio, enabling it to it serve supplemental water to its member

23 agencies, which, in turn serve water to their members or retail customers, reaching approximately

24 19 million Californians living in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and

25 Ventura counties. Metropolitan is directly affected by the Department of Fish and Wildlife's

26 ("CDFW") and the Department of Water Resources' ("DWR") failure to comply with the

27 California Endangered Species Act ("CESA"), the California Environmental Quality Act

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 ("CEQA"), and DWR's failure to comply with the terms of Metropolitan's contract to receive

2 water from the SWP.

3 4. Mojave's boundaries encompass approximately 4,900 square miles of high desert

4 in San Bernardino County. As a SWP contractor, Mojave's allocation is approximately 2.15

5 percent of the SWP. SWP supplies are crucial to the area's survival, because local aquifers have

6 been in overdraft since the early 1950's, according to recent studies. SWP is an important water

7 supply for the region to meet water supply demands and manage the groundwater basin.

8 5. Coachella's territory embraces 650,000 acres of land in the Colorado Desert region

9 of Riverside, Imperial and San Diego Counties, including the Cities of Coachella, Indian Wells,

10 Indio, La Quinta and Palm Desert and portions of the Cities of Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs

11 and Palm Springs. Coachella provides a number of services within various areas in its territory,

12 including domestic water service to a population of approximately 300,000 people using
13 groundwater produced from numerous wells; groundwater replenishment operations using native,
14 imported and recycled water supplies; sanitary sewer service and wastewater reclamation; storm

15 water protection; and irrigation and agricultural drainage services to approximately 65,000 acres

16 of land. Coachella is the fourth largest contractor for SWP water. Because SWP facilities have
17 not been constructed to deliver water to the Coachella Valley, Coachella and Metropolitan have
18 entered into exchange agreements under which Coachella exchanges the water it obtains under
19 Coachella's SWP contract with DWR for an equal volume of Colorado River water to be

20 delivered from Metropolitan's Colorado River Aqueduct or from advanced deliveries of such

21 water made to Coachella. This exchange water is used by Coachella to replenish groundwater
22 aquifers in the Coachella Valley at the Whitewater Replenishment Facility and the Mission Creek

23 Replenishment facility. Since 1973, Coachella has recharged more than 3 million acre-feet into

24 the groundwater aquifers in the Coachella Valley. These recharge operations are essential for

25 long term management of the aquifers consistent with the requirements of the Sustainable

26 Groundwater Management Act.

27 6. San Gorgonio was formed with the specific purpose of bringing SWP water to the

28 San Gorgonio Pass, which had over drafted groundwater basins. San Gorgonio is a wholesale
- 5 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

1 water agency that sells imported SWP water to local retail water agencies, who either use it to

2 replenish the local groundwater basins or treat it and directly deliver it to customers. San

3 Gorgonio's imported supplies ultimately serve population of about 90,000 people in a 228

4 square mile service area in Riverside County.

5 7. MWDOC is the third largest member of petitioner and plaintiff Metropolitan. It

6 serves over 3.2 million Orange County residents through 28 retail water agencies throughout the

7 county with the exception of the cities of Anaheim, Fullerton and Santa Ana. MWDOC

8 purchases imported water-from the Colorado River and from the SWP in the north through

9 Metropolitan, and distributes this water to its 28 member agencies.

10 8. The SWP is one of the two largest water projects in the state, with the other being

11 the Central Valley Project ("CVP"), which is owned and operated by the United States Bureau of

12 Reclamation ("Reclamation"). The CVP serves its own agricultural, municipal, and industrial

13 water users, as well as wildlife refuges pursuant to its own water rights and legal authorities.

14 Although separate projects, both have water diversions in the southern part of the Sacramento-

15 San Joaquin Delta ("Delta") and have been coordinating water operations for decades, thereby

16 sharing available water supplies under their respective water rights and jointly complying with the

17 State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality Control Plan standards and the federal

18 biological opinions issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the United States

19 National Marine Fisheries Service in compliance with the federal Endangered Species Act. For

20 the last decade, the SWP has also been operating under consistency determinations, which are

21 state permits that approve operations contained in the federal biological opinions as also being

22 compliant with CESA.

23 9. This case is about the unlawful actions of the CDFW and DWR in preparing and

24 approving a new 10-year incidental take permit for operation of the SWP pursuant to CESA and

25 the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the long-term operations covered

26 by the permit.

27 10. CDFW violated CESA because its incidental take permit applies an incorrect

28 definition of "take" and is in excess of legal requirements, including conditions that are
- 6 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

] disproportional with the magnitude and nature of the SWP's incidental take of listed fish, and that

2 unlawfully require the SWC to mitigate for effects of other water diverters, such as the CVP.

3 11. DWR violated CEQA by changing the project description not once, but twice

4 during the preparation of its EIR, precluding informed public participation and decision making;

5 by failing to disclose and analyze the potentially significant impacts of the project it ultimately

6 approved; and by not allowing the public and directly affected stakeholders like Metropolitan,

7 Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC the opportunity to comment on significant new

8 information, including the new alternative that DWR ultimately approved after it certified the

9 Final EIR.

10 12. CDFW violated CEQA by approving a permit and issuing findings for a project

11 that was not evaluated in either the Draft or Final EIR, and by relying on DWR's legally deficient

12 Final EIR.

13 13. In addition to violating CEQA, DWR also breached its contractual obligations to
14 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio by including SWP water supplies and
15 mitigation in the permit application in excess of any legal requirement under CEQA or CESA.

16 PARTIES

17 14. At all times herein mentioned petitioner and plaintiff Metropolitan was and is a
18 special district organized and existing under the provisions of an Act of the California State

19 Legislature, The Metropolitan Water District Act (Water Code App., § 109-1, et seq.). Operating
20 as a consortium of 26 cities and water districts, 1 Metropolitan provides supplemental water

21 supplies to its member agencies, which deliver water to their members or retail customers,

22 serving approximately 19 million people who live and work in Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura,

23
1
24 Metropolitan's member agencies are Calleguas Municipal Water District, Central Basin Municipal Water District, City of Anaheim, City of Beverly Hills, City of Burbank, City of
25 Compton, Eastern Municipal Water District, Foothill Municipal Water District, City of Fullerton, City of Glendale, Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, City of
26 Long Beach, City of Los Angeles, Municipal Water District of Orange County, City of Pasadena, San Diego County Water Authority, City of San Fernando, City of San Marino, City of Santa
27 Ana, City of Santa Monica, Three Valleys Municipal Water District, City of Torrance, Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, West Basin Municipal Water District, and Western
28 Municipal Water District of Riverside County.

- 7-

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego counties. Metropolitan also helps its member agencies

2 develop water recycling, storage and other local resource programs to provide additional supplies

3 and conservation programs to reduce regional demands. To supply its service area with reliable

4 and safe water, Metropolitan also owns and operates an extensive water system including the

5 Colorado River Aqueduct, 16 hydroelectric facilities, nine reservoirs, 819 miles of large-scale

6 pipes and five water treatment plants. Four of these treatment plants are among the 10 largest

7 plants in the world. In fact, Metropolitan is the largest distributor of treated drinking water in the

8 United States. Metropolitan has a long-term contract with DWR that provides Metropolitan with

9 certain participation rights in the SWP. More specifically, Metropolitan has contract rights to use

10 the SWP conveyance system to convey both SWP and other water and, to receive an amount of

11 water pursuant to an annual allocation that DWR makes based on availability, which depends on

12 precipitation, snowpack, available storage, water quality and other environmental regulations, and

13 other factors. These water supply components of Metropolitan's contact and the contracts of 28

14 other public water agencies are central to the SWP's construction and operation as Metropolitan

15 and the other SWP contractors fund all SWP capital and operating costs associated with water

16 storage and conveyance. Metropolitan is obligated to pay fixed capital and operations costs

17 whether or not there is an is allocation of water or MWD receives any water from the SWP. On

18 average, SWP water comprises a substantial part of Metropolitan's overall water supply portfolio,

19 and its relatively high quality supports regional and local water supply projects, including

20 recycling, groundwater management and conjunctive use.2

21 15. At all times herein mentioned petitioner and plaintiff Mojave was and is a self-

22 governing special district formed under Appendix 97, et seq. of the California Water Code, and,

23 pursuant to California Water Code Appendix 97-1.5, is authorized to do any and every act

24 necessary to be done so that sufficient water may be available for any present or future beneficial

25 use of the lands and inhabitants within Mojave's service area, including the construction,

26 2 Indeed, Metropolitan has a legally mandated objective of providing its member agencies with
27 full service water that consists of a blend that includes SWP water. (MWD Act, Water Code

2 maintenance, alteration, purchase and operation of any and all works of improvement within

3 Mojave's service area necessary or proper to carry out any purpose authorized by law.
16.

4 On June 22, 1963, Mojave and DWR entered into a "Contract Between the State of

5 California Department of Water Resources and Mojave Water Agency for a Water Supply." The

6 contract established Mojave's ability to participate in SWP water and requirements for the

7 purchase thereof. On December 20, 1963, the MWA obtained a judgment in San Bernardino

8 Superior Court, Case No. 116910 in an action to validate the original Mojave SWP Contract.
Over the years since 1959, Mojave's contract has been amended several times.

9 17.

10 To date, Mojave has invested over $210 million in delivery and monitoring

11 systems, as well as $324 million in the SWP since 1964. Another $100 million in additional

12 SWP permanent Table A water acquisitions were made in anticipation of future supply demands.

13 Current projections anticipate Mojave spending an additional $500 million for SWP costs
pursuant to Mojave's contract with DWR through 2035.

14 18.

15 At all times herein mentioned, plaintiff and petitioner Coachella was and is a

16 public agency of the State of California organized and operating under the County Water District

17 Law, California Water Code sections 30000 et seq., and the Coachella District Merger Law,

18 California Water Code sections 33100 to 33162. Coachella was formed in 1918 as the Coachella

19 Valley County Water District and subsequently changed its name to Coachella Valley Water

District.

20 19.

21 Coachella's territory embraces 650,000 acres of land in the Colorado Desert region

22 of Riverside, Imperial and San Diego Counties, including the Cities of Coachella, Indian Wells,

23 Indio, La Quinta and Palm Desert and portions of the Cities of Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs

24 and Palm Springs. Coachella provides a number of services within various areas in its territory,

25 including domestic water service to a population of approximately 300,000 people using

26 groundwater produced from numerous wells; groundwater replenishment operations using native,

27 imported and recycled water supplies; sanitary sewer service and wastewater reclamation; storm

28 water protection; and irrigation and agricultural drainage services to approximately 65,000
of land. acres

. 9.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 20. On March 29, 1963, Coachella and DWR entered into a "Contract Between the

2 State of California Department of Water Resources and Coachella Valley County Water District

3 for a Water Supply." The contract establishes Coachella's ability to participate in SWP water and

4 requirements for the purchase thereof. On November 18, 1963, Coachella obtained a judgment in

5 Riverside Superior Court Case No. 80432 in an action to validate the original Coachella State

6 Water Contract. Since 1967, Coachella's State Water Contract has been the subject of numerous

7 amendments, including an amendment executed March 14, 2019 to extend the term of the

8 contract from 2035 to 2085. Several of the amendments implemented transfers of Table A

9 amounts from other SWP contractors to increase Coachella's Table A amount from its initial

10 contract amount of 23,100 acre-feet to its current contract amount of 138,350 acre-feet, making

11 Coachella the fourth largest contractor for SWP water by Table A amount.3 These amendments

12 have also increased Coachella's capacity in various reaches of the California aqueduct, which

13 correspondingly increased the costs of the SWP annually allocated to Coachella under the

14 Coachella State Water Contract.

15 21. Under its SWP contract with DWR, Coachella pays roughly 3.3% of all supply-

16 related SWP costs and nearly 5.4% of all transportation-related SWP costs.

17 22. Because SWP facilities have not been constructed to deliver water to the Coachella

18 Valley, Coachella and Metropolitan have entered into exchange agreements under which

19 Coachella exchanges the water it obtains under the Coachella State Water Contract for an equal

20 volume of Colorado River water to be delivered from Metropolitan's Colorado River Aqueduct or

21 from advanced deliveries of such water made to Coachella. This exchange water is used by

22 Coachella to replenish groundwater aquifers in the Coachella Valley at the Whitewater

23 Replenishment Facility and the Mission Creek Replenishment facility. Since 1973, Coachella has

24 3 recharged more than 3 million acre-feet into the groundwater aquifers in the Coachella Valley.

25

26

27 3 Pursuant to Article 6 of Coachella's State Water Contract, it has the right to receive an allocated

28 share of available (non-surplus) SWP water, up to a maximum of 138,350 acre-feet per year. This is referred to as "Table A" water.
- 10 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 These recharge operations are essential for long term management of the aquifers consistent with

2 the requirements of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

3 23. At all times herein mentioned, plaintiff and petitioner San Gorgonio was and is a

4 public agency created by the San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency Act, passed by the legislature in

5 1961. San Gorgonio was formed with the specific purpose of bringing SWP water to the San

6 Gorgonio Pass, which had over drafted groundwater basins. San Gorgonio is a wholesale water

7 agency that sells imported SWP water to local retail water agencies that either use it to replenish

8 the local groundwater basins or treat it and directly deliver it to customers. San Gorgonio's

9 imported supplies ultimately serve a population of about 90,000 people a in a 228 square mile

10 service area in Riverside County.

11 24. On November 16, 1962, San Gorgonio and DWR entered into a "Water Supply
12 Contract Between the State of California Department of Water Resources And San Gorgonio Pass
13 Water Agency." The contract established San Gorgonio's ability to participate in SWP water and
14 requirements for the purchase thereof. San Gorgonio holds a Table A allocation of 17,300 AF of

15 SWP water, which it receives through the East Branch of the SWP and through the East Branch
16 Extension, which San Gorgonio constructed with San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water

17 District, another SWP contractor.

18 25. San Gorgonio's overall share of transportation and delivery costs is approximately

19 0.6% of total water supply and transportation costs.

20 26. At all times herein mentioned, petitioner MWDOC was and a is a public agency of

21 the State of California. MWDOC is a wholesale water supplier and resource planning agency that

22 serves over 3.2 million Orange County residents through 28 retail water agencies throughout the

23 county with the exception of the cities of Anaheim, Fullerton and Santa Ana. Local water

24 supplies meet more than half of Orange County's total water demand. To meet the remaining

25 demand, MWDOC purchases imported water-from the Colorado River and from the SWP in the

26 north--through Metropolitan, and distributes this water to its 28 member agencies. These

27 agencies, made up of both city water departments and water districts, provide retail water services
28 to the public.
- 11 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

27. MWDOC is the third largest member of petitioner and plaintiff Metropolitan and

2 appoints four Directors to the Metropolitan Board. MWDOC's mission is to provide reliable,

3 high-quality supplies from Metropolitan and other sources to meet present and future needs at an

4 equitable and economical cost, and to promote water use efficiency for all of Orange County. As

5 a wholesale water supplier and resource planning agency, MWDOC's efforts focus on sound

6 planning and appropriate investments in water supply development, water use efficiency, public

7 information, legislative advocacy, water education, and emergency preparedness. As a

8 almost exclusively on Metropolitan's imported water to Metropolitan member agency that relies
meet its demands (portions of the service area are essentially 100% dependent on imported

10 water), it has a beneficial interest in ensuring reliable and affordable SWP supplies, which

11 includes ensuring that CDFW and DWR have met, but not unlawfully exceeded, the requirements

12 of CEQA and CESA.

13 28. Respondent and Real Party in Interest CDFW is an agency of the State of

14 California under the California Natural Resources Agency and is responsible for the

15 administration and enforcement of CESA. CDFW's headquarters are located at 1416 9th Street,

16 12th Floor, Sacramento, CA 95814. According to its Notice of Determination, dated March 27,

17 2020, acting as a responsible agency, CDFW approved the CESA incidental take permit. The

18 incidental take permit is dated March 31, 2020. On April 1, 2020, the Office of Planning and

19 Research posted CDFW's Notice of Determination for the incidental take permit.

20 29. Respondent, Defendant, and Real Party in Interest DWR is an agency of the State
21 of California under the California Natural Resources Agency. DWR's headquarters are located at

22 1416 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. DWR owns, operates and maintains the SWP, which is

23 the nation's largest state-built, multi-purpose, user-financed water project. DWR is the CEQA

24 lead agency for analyzing, approving and implementing the long-term operations of the SWP. On

25 March 27, 2020, DWR approved the modified Alternative 2(b) and certified the Final EIR. On

26 March 30, 2020, the Office of Planning and Research posted DWR's Notice of Determination

27 regarding its March 27th project approval and Final EIR certification.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 30. California Natural Resources Agency is named as a Real Party in Interest with

2 respect to Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's SWP contract causes of

3 action. California Natural Resources Agency is an agency of the State of California responsible

4 for the state's natural resource policies, programs and activities and an umbrella organization for

5 other state departments, such as DWR and CDFW. Its headquarters are located at 1416 Ninth

6 Street, Suite 1311, Sacramento, CA 95814.

7 31. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC do not know the

8 true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents

9 and Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue those Respondents and

10 Defendants under fictitious names. Each of the Respondents and Defendants is the agent and/or

11 employee of Respondents DWR and CDFW, and each performed acts on which this action is

12 based within the course and scope of such party's agency and/or employment. Additionally,

13 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC do not know the true names and

14 capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest ROES

15 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue those Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names.

16 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC will amend this Petition to show

17 the true names and capacities when those names and capacities have been ascertained.

18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 32. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Public Resources Code

20 sections 21167(a), 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, et seq., 1085,

21 and 1094.5.

22 33. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 401(1) and
23 395 because Respondent and Real Party in Interest CDFW, Respondent, Defendant and Real

24 Party in Interest DWR, and Real Party in Interest California Natural Resources Agency each has

25 its principal place of business and legal residence in the County of Sacramento, and because the

26 California Attorney General has an office in the County of Fresno. (See Harris v. Alcoholic

27 Beverage Control Appeals Board (1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 759, 770-771.)

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- STANDING

2 34. Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's, San Gorgonio's and MWDOC's water

3 supplies will be directly and adversely affected by both CDFW's issuance of a flawed CESA
† incidental take permit based on its legally inadequate compliance with CEQA and DWR's actions

5 in certifying the legally inadequate Final EIR and approval of the long-term operations plan for

6 the SWP. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC have no plain, speedy

7 and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in that they will suffer irreparable harm if the

8 CESA incidental take permit is implemented.

0 35. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC have a direct and

10 beneficial interest in CDFW's and DWR's legally adequate compliance with the CESA and

11 CEQA, and all other applicable laws in approving and implementing the SWP long-term

12 operations plan and CESA incidental take permit. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, and San

13 Gorgonio submitted multiple timely objections on CESA, CEQA and other grounds to CDFW

14 and DWR.

15 36. The adverse environmental impacts of DWR's and CDFW's actions will directly

16 and substantially affect Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC as they

17 seek to promote and enforce the purposes of CESA and CEQA, the purposes of which are

18 defeated by those agencies' approvals. The incidental take permit approval is based on an

19 unlawful application of CESA that resulted in water supply costs and mitigation that exceeds

20 what is legally required to minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of the incidental "take" of

21 CESA-listed species resulting from SWP operations. The CEQA mitigation is in excess of what

22 is legally required to avoid potential significant environmental impacts, as the project has no

23 significant environmental effects. Moreover, the approvals were made without compliance with

24 CEQA's informational and public participation objectives. Determining the true facts about the

25 project's environmental impacts and disclosing those facts to decision-makers and the public are

26 within the core statutory intent of CEQA to promote fully informed public participation and

27 decision making.

28
- 14 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 37. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC directly or

2 indirectly rely upon water exported from the Delta as in important part of their respective water

3 supply portfolios. Accordingly, the incidental take permit and the alternative approved in the

4 Final EIR, both of which seek to unlawfully limit the availability and reliability of much-needed

5 water supplies, relate to Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's, San Gorgonio's and MWDOC's

6 beneficial interests in reliable SWP supplies and, with respect to enforcement of Metropolitan's,

7 Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's contractual rights.

8 38. CDFW has a mandatory and public duty to comply with the CESA, CEQA, and all

9 other applicable laws, when relying on the Final EIR as a responsible agency and issuing the
10 CESA incidental take permit. DWR has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA and

11 all other applicable laws when certifying the Final EIR and approving and implementing the long-

12 term operations plan for the SWP. DWR also has an obligation to comply with its contracts with

13 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio in all its activities, including permitting. In

14 addition, the issues in this action under CESA and CEQA are issues of public right and

15 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC bring this action in the public

16 interest to enforce CDFW's and DWR's public duties.

17 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND NOTICES

18 39. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC have performed or

19 are excused from performing any and all conditions precedent to filing this action. Metropolitan,

20 Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC fully exhausted any administrative remedies by

21 objecting to the changing and undisclosed final project description; failure to analyze the

22 alternatives; and failure to recirculate the EIR after substantial new information was added. The

23 facts relevant to these claims continued to evolve continually up to the approval of the CESA

24 incidental take permit, certification of the Final EIR, and approval of the long-term operation

25 plan. Metropolitan, the State Water Contractors, of which Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, and

26 San Gorgonio are members, and/or other agencies, organizations, and individuals also raised legal

27 deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint. Furthermore, the extensive new information

28 that was not publicly disclosed and which formed the basis of the FEIR, and the ITP which was
- 15 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 never made public prior to its approval, deprived the public of the ability to exhaust their

2 administrative remedies with specificity. Accordingly, Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San

3 Gorgonio and MWDOC are alternatively excused from any obligation to exhaust administrative

4 remedies. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177 [any obligation to exhaust administrative remedies

5 under CEQA "does not apply to any alleged grounds .. . for which there was not a public hearing

6 or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing before

7 the approval of the project . . ."].)

8 40. Metropolitan and Mojave have complied with Public Resources Code section

q 21167.5 by providing DWR and CDFW notice of intent to commence this action attached as

10 Exhibits 1 and 2 of the original Petition and Complaint.

11 41. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Metropolitan and

12 Mojave provided a copy of the original Petition to the California Attorney General attached as

13 Exhibit 3 to the original Petition and Complaint. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gabriel

14 and MWDOC have provided a copy of this First Amended Petition and Complaint to the

15 California Attorney General attached as Exhibit A.

16 42. Service of this Petition on CDFW and DWR satisfy any applicable service

17 requirements under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, subdivisions (a), (b), and (c).

18 43. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2),

19 Metropolitan and Mojave filed a notice of their election to prepare the administrative record as

20 Exhibit 4 to the original Petition and Complaint. Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC hereby

21 join in that election, and the Petitioners and Plaintiffs to this First Amended Complaint have

22 concurrently filed an amended notice of election.

23 TIMELINESS AND REQUEST FOR CEQA HEARING

24 44. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action

25 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 312, 337(a), 343, and Public Resources Code sections

26 48. SWP Construction was authorized by approval of the Burns-Porter Act

27 (Proposition One) on the November 1960 state ballot. In response, DWR entered into contracts

28 with 29 water agencies (collectively the "State Water Contractors") in the 1960s, including
18 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio. Pursuant to the contracts, the State Water

3 Contractors pay all of the SWP capital and operating costs relating to storage and conveyance of

4 water, and DWR owns, operates and maintains the SWP for their benefit and is obligated to make

5 all reasonable efforts to perfect and protect SWP water rights and to satisfy the water supply

6 commitments made to the State Water Contractors under the contracts. Reliability of the supply
has been important to Metropolitan since the inception of the project.

7 49.

8 Construction on the SWP began in 1957, prior to the passage of the Burns-Porter
Act. The first deliveries to the Bay Area were made in 1962. Metropolitan entered into the

10 original contract with DWR in 1960; Mojave in 1963; Coachella in 1963 and San Gorgonio in
1962. In 1973, the pumps

11 and the East and West branches of the California Aqueduct were

12 completed and the first water was delivered to Southern California. At the time of the initial

13 water deliveries to Southern California, Metropolitan had already paid more than $190 million for
SWP construction bonds and additional lump sum payments.
14 SWP Operations

15 50.

16 The SWP operates in coordination with the CVP under the Coordinated Operations

17 Agreement between the federal government and the State of California (authorized by Pub. L. 99

18 546). The Coordinated Operations Agreement governs how the SWP and CVP share water rights

19 and operations to meet specific water quality and outflow requirements in the Delta. It is based

20 on principles of equitable sharing arising from requirements that their operations be coordinated,

21 and as a matter of practical necessity, the two projects operate together in a complex tidal estuary.
51.

22 The SWP and CVP are regulated by web of state and federal laws, including

23 state and federal water quality statutes, Army Corps of Engineers permits, federal Endangered

24 Species Act biological opinions, and the SWP operations under one or more state incidental take

25 authorizations pursuant to CESA. These layers of concurrent state and federal regulations cover
every month of the year.

26 52.

27 The Coordinated Operations Agreement provides the federal nexus that facilitates

28 the SWP's federal Endangered Species Act coverage under the same biological opinions as the
CVP.

- 19 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 53. The SWP and CVP operate pursuant to water rights permits and licenses issued by

2 the State Water Resources Control Board. The separate water rights of the SWP and CVP allow

3 appropriation of water by directly using the water, diverting water to storage for later withdrawal,

4 and rediverting the water to storage further downstream for later consumptive use. Operating to

5 the respective water right requirements of the SWP and CVP results in either bypass flows or

6 withdrawal of water from storage to help satisfy specific water quality and operational criteria.

7 Consultation History for ESA and CESA Coverage

8 54. The SWP must have both CESA and federal Endangered Species Act coverage.

9 During the permitting process at issue, DWR concurrently sought state and federal permits,

10 complying with the federal Endangered Species Act and CESA, according to the timeline

11 provided below:

12 August 2016: DWR and Reclamation request reinitiation of consultation for BiOps for

13 the coordinated long-term operation plan.

14 January 2019: Reclamation submits initial biological assessment for coordinated long-

15 term operation plan for the SWP and CVP.

16 July 2019: Reclamation releases for public comment its draft environmental impact

17 statement for the coordinated long-term operation plan.

18 October 2019: Reclamation releases the final biological assessment.

19 October 2019: The United State Fish and Wildlife and the National Marine Fisheries

20 Service sign the final biological opinions.

21 November 2019: DWR releases for public review and comment its draft environmental

22 impact report for CESA permit for the long-term operation of the SWP. The proposed

23 project is consistent with 2019 federal biological opinions.

24 December 2019: DWR submits application for an incidental take permit pursuant to

25 CESA. Proposed project not contained in the Draft EIR is inconsistent with 2019 federal

26 biological opinions.

27 December 2019: Reclamation releases the final environmental impact statement for the

28 coordinated long-term operation plan for the SWP and CVP.
- 20 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- February 2020: Reclamation signs the Record of Decision.

2

3 March 2020: DWR releases Final EIR and signs the Notice of Determination adopting

4 modified Alternative 2(b), an alternative that had never previously been disclosed.

5 March 2020: CDFW issues CESA incidental take permit and findings for a project that
has not previously been disclosed.

6 55.

7 This consultation process of receiving both federal and state permits under two

8 different endangered species acts is complicated by the fact that there are species that are listed

9 under state law only, federal law only, and those that are dual listed. The table below describes

this.

10 Dual Listed Federal ESA listed only

11 CESA listed only

Delta smelt Central Valley

12 Longfin Smelt

winter-run Chinook steelhead

13 salmon and Green Sturgeon

14 spring-run Chinook Southern Resident

15 salmon Killer Whale

16

17 56.

18 a More than a decade ago, in 2008 and 2009, respectively, the United States Fish

19 and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service issued biological opinions

20 permitting the coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP for federally listed species. Beginning

21 in 2009, CDFW issued consistency determinations, which is allowed under state law based on

22 CDFW conclusions that operating to the federal biological opinions would also comply with

23 CESA for the dual-listed species. Also in 2009, CDFW issued a Fish and Game Code section

24 2081 permit to authorize incidental take of Longfin smelt, a state-only listed species for which a

25 consistency determination was not a permitting option. This state and federal permitting structure
existed for about a decade, with all species covered by the same

26 operational rules, except Longfin

27 smelt. However, even operational parameters required for the protection of Longfin smelt under

28 the separate Fish and Game Code section 2081 permit were largely consistent with the state and

- 21 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 federal permitting structure, being partially reliant on operational requirements for the protection

2 of Delta smelt, a state and federally listed species.

3 57. This consistency in state and federal permits for the coordinated operation of the

4 CVP and SWP ended in March 2020 when DWR certified the Final EIR and approved a SWP

5 long-term operations plan that was dramatically different than the jointly proposed DWR-

6 Reclamation long term operation plan permitted by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service

7 and the National Marine Fisheries Service, and when the CDFW signed and approved a Fish and

8 Game Code section 2081 permit for all dual listed and state-only species (winter-run Chinook

9 salmon, spring-run Chinook salmon, Delta smelt and Longfin smelt) that was dramatically
10 different than both the DWR-Reclamation long-term operations plan and DWR's final SWP long-

11 term operations plan.

12 SWP CESA Permit

13 58. The 2020 CESA incidental take permit covers the operation of the SWP in the

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

59. The facilities or activities not included in the incidental take permit include flood

2 control; CVP facilities, operations, and agreements; and Oroville Dam and Feather River
operations, as these are covered by separate permits. The CESA incidental take permit area

4 includes existing storage and export facilities located in the Delta and vicinity, generally being

5 downstream from Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River to the confluence with the Sacramento

6 River, and downstream to the Delta.

7 60. As stated in DWR's incidental take permit application, the project's objective is

8 "to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual
obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water in accordance

10 with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up

11 to full contract quantities."

12 61. The CESA permit authorizes incidental take of Longfin smelt (state-listed

13 threatened), Delta smelt (state-listed endangered), spring-run Chinook salmon ESU (state-listed

14 threatened), and winter-run Chinook salmon ESA (state-listed endangered).

15 DWR's CEQA and CESA Process

16 62. On April 19, 2019, DWR distributed a Notice of Preparation of the Draft EIR for

17 its SWP long-term operations plan. DWR held public scoping meetings regarding the Draft EIR

18 on May 6 and May 13, 2019.

19 63. DWR prepared an Initial Study for the SWP long-term operations plan, DWR

20 determined that the SWP long-term operations plan would not have a significant impact on the

21 following resource topics: aesthetics, agriculture/forestry, air quality, biological resources

22 (terrestrial), cultural resources, energy, geology/soils, greenhouse gas emissions,

23 hazards/hazardous materials, surface water hydrology, land use/planning, mineral resources,

24 noise, population/housing, public services, recreation and transportation/traffic. The Initial Study

25 concluded that the long-term operations plan would not result in significant impacts on hydrology

26 or surface water resources. But because implementation of the long-term operations plan would

27 alter existing hydrology, these alterations could potentially result in impacts on resources

28 dependent on existing hydrologic conditions, including water quality and aquatic biological
- 24 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 resources. Because of these potentially significant impacts, DWR decided to prepare an

2 environmental impact report.

3 64. In November 2019, DWR released its Draft EIR for public comment, identifying a

4 proposed project, which was consistent with the project that the federal fish agencies-the Fish

5 and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service-permitted in the biological

6 opinions dated October 2019. DWR determined that the proposed project would have no

7 potentially significant environmental impacts. Nevertheless, DWR added four alternatives

8 (Alternative 2(a), 2(b), Alternative 3 and Alternative 4) to the Draft EIR. The potential effects

9 were estimated by comparing each alternative to the No Action and the proposed project without

10 fully modeling each alternative. The full range of impacts for these alternatives were not

11 disclosed in the Draft EIR.

12 65. DWR held a public meeting on its Draft EIR on December 12, 2019 in West

13 Sacramento.

14 66. In December 2019, DWR submitted its application for an incidental take permit to

15 CDFW. The incidental take permit application identified a project that was different than the

16 proposed project contained in the Draft EIR and different than the project authorized in the

17 biological opinions. In the application, DWR concluded that the project satisfied CESA

18 requirements.

19 67. Even though DWR concluded that the original proposed project in the Draft EIR

20 had no significant and unavoidable environmental impacts, DWR added new mitigation in the

21 form of new spring and summer outflow to the proposed project in its application for an

22 incidental take permit. These new operational requirements and mitigation exceed what is

23 required to comply with CESA and CEQA.

24 68. DWR's public comment period for its Draft EIR ended January 6, 2020. On
25 January 6, Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio commented on the Draft EIR in

26 combination with the State Water Contractors, raising numerous detailed objections, including

27 objections to the changing project description and legally insufficient analysis.

28

- 25 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 69. Out of concern that DWR had further changed the project description and was

2 planning to include significant new information in the Final EIR, which triggered CEQA's

3 recirculation requirement, Metropolitan commented on March 17, 2020, objecting on multiple

4 legal grounds and reiterating its prior comments on the Draft EIR. Metropolitan's objections

5 include the failure of DWR to provide for public review of the previously undisclosed changes to

6 the proposed project and the analysis of their impact which, under CEQA, require recirculation;

7 that the project description provides mitigation and limits water export in excess of legal

8 requirements; and, that the new project proposal includes infeasible and legally unnecessary

9 mitigation.

10 70. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio commented on CDFW's

11 legally inadequate CEQA implementation in combination with the State Water Contractors on

12 March 27, 2020, prior to CDFW signing the incidental take permit on March 31,2020.

13 Metropolitan and the other State Water Contractors informed CDFW that the approval of a

14 project had not been subject to prior review and that the lack of disclosure violated CEQA.

15 71. The Final EIR was issued and the Notice of Determination was signed on March

16 27, 2020. DWR's March 2020 Final EIR and notice of determination approved a project that was

17 different than any of the project alternatives contained in the November 2019 public Draft EIR,

18 the CESA Application, and the SWP's new federal 2019 biological opinions for ESA coverage.

19 72. Even though DWR concluded that the project described in its application for an

20 incidental take permit fully complies with CESA, DWR added substantial new operational

21 restrictions and mitigation to modified Alternative 2(b). These new operational requirements and

22 mitigation exceed what is required to comply with CESA and CEQA.

23 73. The Final EIR includes new modeling and analysis, and a new previously

24 undisclosed modified Alternative 2(b) that DWR approved with no opportunity for public review

25 and comment prior to certifying the Final EIR, approving the modified project and signing the

26 notice of determination. The previously undisclosed components of the modified Alternative 2(b)

27 include, but are not limited to:

28 new dry-year operation of Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gate;
- 26 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2 new spring-run Chinook salmon daily-loss trigger for an export reduction;

0 new winter-run Chinook salmon daily-loss trigger for an export reduction;

D new November and December export reduction for winter-run Chinook salmon;

5 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh; and

6 new authority for CDFW to control real-time operations of the SWP to benefit larval

7 Delta smelt between an operational range of -5,000 to -1,250 cfs flow in Old and Middle

River.

8 74.

9 The components of modified Alternative 2(b) that were never modeled or

10 analyzed, and therefore not disclosed to the public or decision-makers include, but are not limited

to:

11

12 deferral of up to 150,000 acre-feet of spring outflow and 100,000 acre-feet of summer

13 outflow to subsequent years, including the use of Oroville storage;

14 implementation of daily winter-run Chinook salmon loss trigger for export reduction;

15 daily spring-run Chinook salmon loss trigger;

16 larval Delta smelt operations between -1,250 and -5,000 cfs Old and Middle River flow;

17 November and December winter-run Chinook salmon loss triggers for export reductions;

and

18

19 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh.

75.

20 Although incomplete, the Final EIR includes significant new modeling and

21 analysis that was never provided to the public for review and comment. The final impact report

22 also includes two brand new technical appendices (J and K); substantial revisions to four other

23 technical appendices (C, E, F, and H); and dozen new technical reports and modeling

24 outcomes-containing significant new information that was never circulated for public review.

76.

25 The exact project for which DWR sought an incidental take permit is unknowable.

26 The application for an incidental take permit was never amended, yet CDFW relied on modeling

27 for Alternative 2(b) that was not presented in the application or the Draft EIR, and never provided

28 to the public for review and comment. Many other new project components were later added to
modified Alternative 2(b) in the Final EIR and CESA incidental take permit that had never been
• 27 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 previously disclosed, analyzed, or circulated for public comment prior to finalization of the

2 permit.

3 77. The incidental take permit is dated March 31, 2020. The incidental take permit

4 describes a project that is different than any of the alternatives contained in the November 2019

5 public Draft EIR, the CESA permit application, the Final EIR, and the SWP's federal ESA

6 coverage in the biological opinions. The previously undisclosed components of the permit that

7 were never analyzed in any environmental impact report, include, but are not limited to new

8 limits on export operations for Longfin smelt, and a new Delta Smelt salvage calculation and

9 limit on exports. The permit also adds an additional estimated $179 million dollars in new non-

10 flow obligations.

11 78. Even though DWR concluded in the Draft EIR that the proposed project and

12 Alternative 2(b) had no significant impacts, and even though DWR concluded that the project

13 described in its permit application complied with CESA, CDFW imposed substantial new and

14 previously undisclosed operational limits and mitigation. These new project obligations are

15 substantial, meaning they are out of proportion with the minimal effects shown in the underlying

16 analysis.

17 79. The incidental take permit imposes obligations that are out of proportion with, and

18 in some cases unrelated to, the effects of the SWP, and are in excess of the fully mitigate

19 standard. (Fish and Game Code, § 2018(b)(2) ["the measures required to meet this obligation

20 shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impacts of the authorized taking on the species"];

21 Cal Code of Regs, tit. 14, § 15126.4.) As DWR explained in its Response to Comments: "Under

22 CESA, a project applicant is only responsible for mitigating the impacts that would be caused by

23 activities proposed by the applicant, as opposed to impacts caused by others," and, "DWR does

24 not control CVP operations." Yet, the CESA incidental take permit includes requirements that

25 the SWP reduce exports when Delta smelt are entrained in the federal CVP facilities. The permit

26 also requires the SWP to mitigate for the effects of upstream federal CVP reservoirs operated by

27 Reclamation.

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- 80.

2 CDFW's changes to the project and imposition of unjustified additional mitigation

3 measures presents complicated operational issues. To achieve compliance and enjoy protection

4 under both the federal Endangered Species Act and CESA, DWR is required to comply with the

5 conditions in both the federal biological opinions as well as the state incidental take permit.

6 Nonetheless, CDFW stated that if there were any inconsistencies between the federal endangered

7 species act permit and the state incidental take permit, the state permit is controlling. (See CDFW

8 ITP, Condition of Approval #3 ["For purposes of this ITP, where the terms and conditions in the

9 federal authorization are less protective of the Covered Species or otherwise conflict with this

10 ITP, the conditions of approval set forth in this ITP shall control"].) CDFW's permit is
inconsistent with law as the SWP must comply with both federal and state law.

11 81.

12 CDFW is required to utilize the best available scientific information. But it did

13 not, often ignoring the statistical and scientific uncertainty associated with the analyses it relied

on.

14 82.

15 The incidental take permit and CDFW's findings fail to identify the exact nature

16 and magnitude of incidental take associated with the SWP, and then fail to link that SWP-specific

17 take to minimization measures and measures required to fully mitigate the impacts of the

18 authorized incidental take. The result is the imposition of obligations on the SWP that violate
legal standards.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

California Endangered Species Act)

22 (Against CDFW and DOES 1-100)

25 by reference each previous paragraph of this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in

full.

26 84.

27 All "persons," including state agencies such as DWR, are prohibited from taking a

28 threatened or endangered species unless authorized under an incidental take permit. (Fish &
Game Code, §§ 2080, 2081; Kern County Water Agency v. Watershed Enforcers (2010) 185 Cal.
29 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 App. 4th 969, 980-981.) In adopting CESA, the Legislature also intended that mitigation to

2 address particular impacts on a species "shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of

3 the authorized taking on the species," "shall maintain the [project] applicant's objectives to the

4 greatest extent possible," and "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game

5 Code, § 2081.)

6 85. CDFW's actions constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it failed to

7 proceed in a manner required by law. The defects in the incidental take permit are pervasive and

8 fundamental. CDFW prejudicially abused its discretion by (1) imposing conditions in the

9 incidental take permit that violate CESA; (2) issuing a decision unsupported by the Director's

10 factual findings; and (3) making factual findings not supported by the evidence. (Environmental

11 Protection Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.

12 4th 459, 478). The incidental take permit's defects and CDFW's violations of CESA include, but

13 are not limited to the following:

14 Improper Definition of Take

15 86. Under the Fish & Game Code, "take" "means hunt, pursue, catch, or kill, or

16 attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture or kill." (Fish & Game Code, § 86.) Habitat is not within

17 the definition of "take." (Environmental Council of Sacramento v. City of Sacramento,

18 142 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1040 (2006) [*We reject any insinuation that the definition of 'take' under

19 Fish and Game Code section 2081 subdivision (b)(2) encompasses habitat alone"]; 94 Ops. Cal.

20 Atty. Gen. 605 [concluding "State law does not prohibit indirect harm to a state-listed endangered

21 species or threated species by way of habitat modification"].)

22 87. CDFW attempts to characterize habitat modification as "impacts of the authorized

23 take" that must be fully mitigated under Fish & Game Code § 2081 and Cal. Code. Regs., tit. 14 g

24 783.4(a)(2). For example, the incidental take permit states at page 44: "Impacts of the authorized

25 taking also include adverse impacts to covered species related to temporal losses, increased

26 habitat fragmentation, reduction in habitat extent and quality, and increased edge effects and the

27 Project's incremental contribution to cumulative impacts (indirect effects)."

28
30 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 88. Similarly, in the CESA Findings CDFW asserts that project-related disturbance of

2 covered species habitat are expected to result in incidental take of those species and that "adverse

3 changes to habitat characteristics that certain covered species rely on, is an appropriate and

4 necessary indicator of the extent of incidental take at issue." (CESA Findings at pp. 6-7.) A plain

5 reading of the incidental take permit and the related California Endangered Species Act Findings

6 demonstrates that the agency is improperly using habitat modification as a proxy for species

7 mortality. This runs afoul of CESA by impermissibly considering habitat modification itself to be

8 a taking.

9 Permit Conditions Inconsistent with Project Objectives

10 89. Under CESA, CDFW "shall maintain the applicant's objectives to the greatest

11 extent possible" when selecting among mitigation measures. (Fish & Game Code, § 2081(b)(2).)

12 90. DWR explains in its incidental take permit application that "[t]he objective of the

13 Proposed Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable

14 laws, contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water

15 in accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and

16 agreements up to full contract quantities. DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve

17 operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific

18 information." (CESA Application at p. 3-1; see also Draft EIR § 3.1.1.)

19 91. CDFW makes a conclusory finding that required mitigation in the incidental take

20 permit maintain the project's objectives to the greatest extent possible but provides no analysis to

21 support that statement. (CESA Findings at p. 43.) The incidental take permit shows that CDFW

22 did not maintain the project's objectives. For example, Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San

23 Gorgonio and MWDOC are informed and believe that CDFW intended to ensure no additional

24 SWP exports from the Delta would be allowed under the incidental take permit, which is

25 fundamentally inconsistent with the stated project objectives in the Draft EIR and CESA

26 Application. Conditions in the incidental take permit, including but not limited to, conditions

27 requiring additional export flow restrictions not tied to any anticipated incidental take results in

28
• 31 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the imposition of mitigation that does not maintain the project's objective of optimizing water

2 supply and is not based on the best available science.

3 Disproportionate Mitigation

4 92. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of

5 an authorized taking "shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the authorized

6 taking on the species." (Fish & Game Code, § 2081(b)(2).)

7 93. CDFW improperly imposed minimization and mitigation measures that are

8 disproportionate to the alleged impacts of the incidental take authorized under the incidental take
permit. For example, DWR explained in its application for an incidental take permit that the

10 long-term operations would minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of incidental take from the

11 SWP. CDFW nonetheless imposed new minimization, mitigation and monitoring requirements in

12 the incidental take permit well above and beyond the conditions in prior authorizations these

13 new requirements will cost approximately $179 million and require significant additional SWP

14 export restrictions. These water supply and financial costs are in addition to the approximately

15 $580 million and significant operational limitations that were already incorporated into the

16 project through the federal endangered species act biological opinions and changes DWR made to

17 the project in the Final EIR.

18 94. CDFW fails to tie this mitigation to the alleged SWP impacts on the covered

19 species. For example, the new spring (April-May) outflow obligation maintains the effect the of

20 SWP at the same level that CDFW permitted under the prior consistency determinations, yet the

21 incidental take permit requires an additional 396.3 acres to mitigate a change in April-May

22 outflow. Either CDFW is requiring the SWP to mitigate the same effect twice, or it is requiring

23 the SWP to mitigate for the effect of the CVP's change in April-May operations. Either is

24 unlawful. Compounding CDFW's error in failing to explain how the incidental take permit's

25 measures mitigate for alleged impacts from the project, it is evident that much of the mitigation is

26 impermissibly based on impacts caused by other water users. For example, CDFW added new

27 requirements to the permit that require that the SWP reduce exports when Delta smelt are

28 entrained in the federal CVP facilities.
- 32 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P Infeasible Mitigation

2 95. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of

3 any authorized taking "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game Code,

4 § 2081(b)(2).) CDFW issued the incidental take permit with conditions that are not capable of

5 successful implementation, including, but not limited to, conditions that require DWR to prevent

6 other water diverters from diverting the water that the incidental take permit precludes the SWP

7 from diverting.

8 Inadequate CESA Findings

9 96. CDFW's California Endangered Species Act Findings are inadequate and

10 unsupported by substantial evidence. For example, contrary to law, CDFW failed to rely on the

11 best scientific information in making its findings and issuing the incidental take permit. (Fish &

12 Game Code, § 2081(c).) Instead CDFW relied on conclusory statements and repeatedly failed to

13 acknowledge the scientific uncertainty in its assumptions.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5-Violation of the

16 California Environmental Quality Act)

17 (Against CDFW and DOES 1-100)

18 97. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC incorporate herein

19 by reference each previous paragraph of this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in

20 full.

21 98. "[T]he legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford

22 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

23 language." (City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015) 61

24 Cal.4th 945, 963, internal punctuation and citation omitted.) When complying with CEQA, a

25 responsible agency must proceed in the manner required by law, and its determinations must be

26 supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Cal. Code Regs., tit.14,

27 co. 15096; River Watch v. Olivenhain Muni. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186.)

28

33 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

99. CDFW violated CEQA in ways independent of and in addition to violations by

2 DWR. CDFW approved an operation that was never analyzed in the Final EIR. The public was

3 never afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the alternative operation and decision

4 makers approved the project without being fully informed as to its impacts. The only analysis

5 that was available to decision makers was contained in the Final EIR. The procedural and

6 substantive defects in the Final EIR are so pervasive and fundamental that informed decision-

7 making and informed public participation were impossible. CDFW's errors constitute a

8 procedural and substantive violation of CEQA.

0 100. CDFW abused its discretion in numerous ways, including relying on a

10 procedurally and substantively flawed Final EIR; imposing CEQA mitigation for unidentified

11 impacts; adopting misleading and contradictory findings; and approving a project that has not yet

12 undergone adequate CEQA review. CDFW's CEQA violations include, but are not limited to, the

13 following.

14 Inconsistent and unstable project description

15 101. A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA's

16 mandate. (Washoe Meadows Community v. Department of Parks and Recreation (2017) 17

17 Cal.App.5th 277, 287-288.) As set forth below in greater detail, the Final EIR violates this
18 fundamental mandate because the project description evolved throughout the administrative

19 process and neither modified Alternative 2(b) nor the project that CDFW approved in the CESA

20 incidental take permit were analyzed in the Final EIR.

21 102. The project descriptions in the Draft EIR, the incidental take application, Final

22 EIR, and incidental take permit are all materially different. This inconsistency in describing the

23 project prevented informed public comment and informed decision-making and rendered the

24 Final EIR, CEQA Findings, and CDFW's incidental take permit legally deficient. This is a

25 procedural and substantive violation of CEQA.

26 Failure to analyze and disclose impacts on the environment

27 103. It is well-established that public agencies, including CEQA responsible agencies,

28 are not permitted to approve projects until after the completion of adequate CEQA review.
- 34 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 (River Watch v. Olivenhain Muni. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1215 [striking down

2 responsible agency's approval where it preceded CEQA review].) CDFW committed a

3 procedural violation by approving a project in the incidental take permit that was not identified or

4 analyzed in the Final EIR.

5 104. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC are informed and

6 believe that CDFW switched from a substantial evidence- and science-based approach to one that

7 improperly focused on "no increase in exports." As such, Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San

8 Gorgonio and MWDOC assert that CDFW pre-determined that the incidental take permit would
not allow any additional SWP exports from the Delta, regardless of what the science and record

10 evidence showed. Given this, CDFW failed to properly exercise its independent judgment in

11 reviewing the certified Final EIR as a responsible agency before approving the project. CDFW's

12 approval of the incidental take permit was pre-determined and without scientific or factual basis,

13 in violation of CEQA.

14 105. In approving the incidental take permit despite the fact that its impacts were never
15 analyzed in any CEQA document, CDFW abused its discretion and violated CEQA's procedural

16 mandates.

17 Improper imposition of mitigation measures

18 106. Mitigation measures are only required to minimize a project's significant

19 environmental impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(3).) Mitigation for impacts that
20 are less than significant is not required. (Ibid.) Further, there must be a nexus and proportionality

21 between the mitigation measure imposed and the identified significant impact on the

22 environment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(4).) Finally, any mitigation must be

23 "feasible," or "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period

24 of time.3 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15364.)
25 107. CDFW's Notice of Determination states that: (1) CDFW concluded that the ITP

26 would not have any significant impacts on the environment; (2) CDFW imposed "additional"

27 a mitigation measures as a condition of approval; (3) CDFW approved a mitigation monitoring and
28 reporting program; and (4) CDFW made CEQA findings as a responsible agency. In its CEQA
- 35 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 findings - and despite CEQA's requirement that "mitigation" have a nexus to an environmental

2 impact and be roughly proportionate to that impact (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15126.4(a)(4)) -

3 CDFW did not identify any significant environmental impacts that the mitigation measures were

4 intended to minimize. Instead, CDFW asserted that the CEQA findings were not required and

5 were only informational. However, the CEQA findings are not supported by substantial evidence

6 in the record, and, as such, are misleading.

7 108. Further, given that the final environmental impact report does not find any

8 potentially significant impacts, there is no nexus between the mitigation measures and the alleged

9 significant impacts that CDFW imposed. In addition, because the environmental impact report
10 does not identify any potentially significant impacts, there is no proportionality between the

11 mitigation measures and the alleged significant impacts that the measures are intended to

12 minimize.

13 California Environmental Quality Act Findings that Are Not Supported by

14 Substantial Evidence

15 109. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support a responsible agency's findings

16 regarding potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence

17 to the findings must be provided. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15091, 15096.) Although the Final

18 EIR did not identify any significant impacts, CDFW nonetheless adopted CEQA findings.

19 (CDFW CEQA Findings, 4, 5.) The findings are affirmatively misleading and contradictory

20 because they are based upon Final EIR that did not actually analyze the project described in the

21 incidental take permit. CDFW's CEQA findings are replete with references to the Final EIR and

22 statements purporting that the Final EIR covers and analyzed the incidental take permit's project

23 impacts. (See, e.g., CDFW's CEQA Findings, 5, 7.) As such, CEQA findings affirmatively

24 misled decision-makers as well as the public for whom the findings were allegedly an

25 "information disclosure" tool, in a manner constituting a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

(Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5-
Violation of CEQA)
(Against DWR and DOES 1-100)
110. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC incorporate herein

6 by reference each previous paragraph of this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in

7 full.

8 111. "[Tjhe legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford

9 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

10 language." (City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015)

11 61 Cal.4th 945, 963, internal punctuation and citation omitted.) When complying with California

12 Environmental Quality Act, a lead agency must proceed in the manner required by law, and its

13 determinations must be supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.)
14 112. The defects in the Final EIR are so pervasive and fundamental that they make

15 informed decision-making and informed public participation impossible. DWR's certification of
16 the Final EIR constitutes procedural violation of CEQA. Procedural violations are reviewed de

17 novo in this court. (See, Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 512, 516.)
18 DWR's actions constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion because DWR failed to proceed in a
19 manner required by law. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.) The Final EIR's defects and DWR's
20 CEQA violations include, but are not limited to the following:

21 Shifting Project Description

22 113. A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA'S
23 mandate. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative

24 and legally sufficient EIR.» (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,
25 193.) DWR violated this fundamental mandate because the project description was not stable
26 throughout the administrative process and because the project that DWR ultimately approved was
27 not adequately analyzed in the Final EIR.

28

- 37 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Failure to Analyze the Project

2 114.

3 DWR failed to comply with CEQA requirement that the lead agency must disclose

4 and analyze a project's impacts. The modified Alternative 2b project first appeared in the Final

5 EIR. Thus, the Draft EIR did not disclose or analyze its potentially significant impacts. The

6 components of modified Alternative 2(b) that were never modeled or analyzed, and the effects of

7 which were never disclosed to the public or decision-makers, include, but are not limited to:

8 deferral of up to 150,000 acre-feet of spring outflow and 100,000 acre-feet of summer

F30 outflow to subsequent years, including the use of Oroville storage;
daily winter-run Chinook salmon loss trigger for export reduction;
daily spring-run Chinook salmon loss trigger;

12 larval Delta smelt operations between -1,250 and -5,000 cfs Old and Middle River flow;

13 November and December winter-run Chinook salmon loss triggers for export reductions;

and

14

15 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh.

16 Failure to Recirculate the Draft Environmental Impact Report Despite Changing the

17 Project Purpose, Description, and Adding Significant New Information

115.

18 A lead agency must recirculate an environmental impact report when "significant

19 new information" is added to the environmental impact report after a draft EIR a is released to the

20 public but before the final EIR is certified. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15088.5.) Here, the Final

21 EIR presents a new project that was not included in the Draft EIR. The Final EIR also includes

22 significant new modeling and analysis that was never provided to the public for review and

23 comment. Although incomplete, the Final EIR also includes two brand new technical appendices

24 (J and K); substantial revisions to four other technical appendices (C, E, F, and H); and provides :

25 dozen new technical reports and modeling outcomes-all of which constitutes significant new

26 information that was never circulated for public review. DWR's failure to recirculate the

27 environmental impact report despite this significant new information precluded informed public

28 comment and informed decision-making. This is procedural violation of CEQA's requirements.

- 38 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Inadequate response to comments

2 116. Under CEQA, a lead agency must make a good faith, reasoned analysis in
3 response to comments provided during the public comment period. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
4 § 15088.) DWR's responses to comments, however, are legally inadequate.

5 No substantial evidence to support certification

6 117. As set forth herein, there is no substantial evidence to support DWR's certification
7 of the FEIR or the approval of the modified Alternative 2(b). Although the EIR cites to certain

8 "expert opinion," those opinions do not constitute substantial evidence because they are

9 speculative, erroneous, and factually unsupported. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15384 [The

10 opinion of "experts" only constitutes substantial evidence where that opinion is not speculation,

11 accurate, and supported by facts].) Given these defects, the record simply does not contain
12 substantial evidence to support DWR's certification of the Final EIR or its approval of modified

13 Alternative 2(b).

14 118. The EIR lacks a consistent project description, is based on shifting project
15 objectives, fails to include adequate analysis of the modified Alternative 2(b) project, and
16 includes significant new information requiring recirculation.

17 Inadequate CEQA Findings

18 119. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support a lead agency's findings
19 regarding potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence
20 to the findings must be provided. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15091.) Although DWR's Notice of
21 Determination states that CEQA findings were made, DWR has not made its findings readily
22 available to the public. Based on the legal inadequacy of the Final EIR, Metropolitan, Mojave,
23 Coachella, San Gorgonio and MWDOC believe, and on that basis allege that DWR's CEQA
24 findings are inadequate.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Breach of Contract)
3 (Against Department of Water Resources and DOES 1-100, Real Party in Interest California
Natural Resources Agency and ROES 1-100)

120. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio incorporate herein by

6 reference cach previous paragraph of this Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

7 121. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio have long-term contracts

8 (*State Water Contracts") with DWR that provide them with certain participation rights in the

9 SWP, including rights to an allocation of the available water supply and right to use the SWP to

10 convey water. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio are obligated to pay their full

11 shares of the SWP costs related to water supply and transportation whether or not there is an

12 allocation of water or they receive any water from the SWP. B (See Exhibit B [Metropolitan's State

13 Water Contract].)

14 122. Metropolitan executed the first State Water Contract in 1960, which had an initial

15 term of 75 years. This original contract served as the prototype contract for all subsequent

16 contracts, including Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's. Metropolitan and DWR have

17 executed various amendments to the State Water Contract, including one on December 11, 2018,

18 which extends the term to 2085. Mojave, Coachella, San Gorgonio and DWR have also executed

19 several amendments, but the allegations contained herein remain effective and are based on

20 provisions that are identical in each of Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's

21 respective State Water Contracts.

22 123. Under their respective State Water Contracts, Metropolitan pays roughly 47% of

23 all supply-related SWP costs and nearly 62% of all transportation-related SWP costs; Mojave

24 pays roughly 2.15% of all supply-related SWP costs and roughly 2.15% to 4 % of all

25 transportation-related SWP costs; Coachella pays roughly 3.3% of all supply-related SWP costs

26 and nearly 5.4% of all transportation-related SWP costs; and San Gorgonio pays approximately

27 0.6% of total water supply and transportation costs. These costs are assessed to and collected

28

- 40 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 from Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio through a Statement of Charges DWR

2 issues on an annual basis.
124. Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio have done all of the things

4 that are required of them by the terms and conditions of their respective State Water Contracts,
and remain ready, able, and willing to meet their respective obligations and complete their

6 performance under the State Water Contracts.

125. Pursuant to Article 6 of Metropolitan's State Water Contract, it has the right to
receive an allocated share of available (non-surpius) SWP water, up to a maximum of 1.9115

9 million acre-feet (MAF) per year, known as "Table A" water. Pursuant to Article 6 of Mojave's

10 State Water Contract, it has the right to receive an allocated share of available (non-surplus) SWP

11 water, up to a maximum of 85,800 acre-feet per year. Pursuant to Article 6 of Coachella's State

12 Water Contract, it has the right to receive an allocated share of available (non-surplus) SWP

13 water, up to a maximum of 138,350 acre-feet per year. Pursuant to Article 6 of San Gorgonio's 6

14 State Water Contract, it has the right to receive an allocated share of available (non-surplus) SWP

15 water, up to a maximum of 17,300 acre-feet per year.

16 126. While Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio are not guaranteed to

17 receive their maximum Table A amounts each year, Article 16(b) of each of their State Water

18 Contracts requires DWR to "make all reasonable efforts to perfect and protect water rights

19 necessary for the System and for the satisfaction of water supply commitments under this

20 contract."

21 127. Furthermore, although DWR has a certain amount of discretion in how it operates

22 and manages the SWP, Article 38 of each of the State Water Contracts at issue in this case

23 requires that DWR do so in a manner that is not "arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable."

24 128. DWR failed to fulfill its contract obligations by agreeing to mitigation in excess of

25 that required by law. Even though DWR determined that the proposed project in its Draft EIR

26 did not have any significant environmental impacts and met CESA requirements, it added new

27 project alternatives to its Draft EIR that included new high water-cost actions. DWR further

28 proposed a different, previously undisclosed high-water cost alternative in its CESA Application,
- 41 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

thereby impacting Metropolitan's, Mojave's, Coachella's and San Gorgonio's water supply

2 reliability and SWP costs in ways in excess of legal requirements. DWR concluded that the new
high-water cost alternative that it included in its CESA Application satisfied CESA requirements
by minimizing and fully mitigating the incidental take associated with the SWP. Nevertheless,
DWR proposed and agreed to yet another, even higher water cost alternative, which included

6 even more export reductions and mitigation, and approved the modified Alternative 2(b) project.

7 The new export reductions and outflow actions contained in the project that DWR ultimately

8 approved are not required to comply with law and thereby violate DWR's contractual obligations.

Q 129. DWR further failed to fulfill its contractual obligations under Articles 16(b) and 38

10 of each of the State Water Contracts at issue in this case by accepting an incidental take permit

11 for continued operations of the SWP that violated or was otherwise inconsistent with law,

12 specifically CESA, because it includes mitigation and other measures that, among other things,

13 are unnecessary, disproportionate and/or infeasible to address potential environmental and

14 species impacts associated with operation of the SWP;

15 are not supported substantial evidence and/or the best available science;
16 are premised on an incorrect definition of "take" of threatened or endangered species;
17 are inconsistent with the project objectives described in the incidental take permit

18 application;

19 were not subjected to the appropriate or adequate environmental review in violation of

20 CEQA; and

21 include mitigation for take or other actions by third parties.

22 130. a As a result, Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio will now receive

23 significantly less Table A water and be forced to pay significantly more in unwarranted water

24 supply-related charges than they otherwise would had DWR not proposed or agreed to such

25 improper conditions.

26 131. Beyond this, by approving modified Alternative 2(b), DWR has agreed to cede

27 control over certain future operations of the SWP to CDFW under the guise of real-time

28 operations. However, pursuant Water Code section 11451, DWR must retain "full charge and
- 42 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2 control of the construction, operation, and maintenance of the [SWP]."
132. By vesting operational decision making to CDFW, DWR has violated Water Code

4 section 11451 and, in doing so, has once again failed to fulfill its obligations under Articles 16(b)
and 38 of the State Water Contracts at issue in this case.

5 133. DWR's failure to comply with Articles 16(b) and 38 constitute material breaches

7 of their State Water Contracts for which Metropolitan, Mojave, Coachella and San Gorgonio have

8 suffered harm and are entitled to relief, including without limitation declaratory relief and specific
performance.

WHEREAS, Articles 22(e) and (g) of such water supply contract provide that the Delta Water Charge as computed in accordance with Articles 22(c) and (d) shall include all projected costs of additional project and supplemental conservation facilities commencing in the years in which the State first incurs capital costs for such facilities after the facilities are authorized; and

9

WHEREAS

WHEREAS, the parties desire that all water supply contracts be amended to postpone inclusion of the projected costs of any authorized additional project and supplemental conservation facilities in the computation of the Delta Water Charge until after the year 1970 and to fix the rate for computing the Delta Water Charge for the year 1970 at $6.65; and
WHEREAS, the payments to be made by the Agency <District> to the State include interest calculated at the "project interest rate" defined in Article 1(t) of such water supply contract to mean the weighted average of the interest rates paid by the State on bonds issued under the Water Resources Development Bond Act (Bond Act) disregarding premiums received on the sale of such bonds; and
WHEREAS, the underlying assumption upon which the "project interest rate" was established was that all of the initial facilities of the State Water Resources Development System (Project) would be financed principally with proceeds of bonds issued under the Bond Act or from other sources on which the interest rate would not exceed that of the bonds issued under the
Bond Act; and

WHEREAS, the State already has financed the Oroville-Thermalito power facilities through Central Valley Project Revenue Bonds and may finance other portions of the project facilities through additional revenue bond issues, bonds issued under other authority granted by the Legislature or the voters, bonds issued by other state agencies, advances from contractors, and other methods under which the financing costs relate to interest rates that may exceed the
interest rate of the bonds issued under the Bond Act; and

WHEREAS, either the State or contractors making advances to the State may be subject to interest rates, or other financing costs that relate to interest rates, which will be greater than the "project interest rate" as presently defined in the contracts; and

10

WHEREAS

to contractors will be made with respect to such facilities so that the charges to contractors taking water through reaches which include such facilities will be the same after such adjustments as such charges would have been if such facilities had been financed by the use of proceeds of bonds issued under the Bond Act, except insofar as the "project interest rate" has been adjusted pursuant to (1) in this recital:

WHEREAS, subsequent to the execution of such water supply contract the State executed
other contracts for a dependable supply of water that contain a provision pertaining to the sale of project water for use within the service area of such a water supply contractor, which provision is not in the District's water supply contract with the State; and
WHEREAS, the State and the District agree that such provision should be added to the
District's water supply contract;
<Following added by Amendment No. 13>

WHEREAS, the Amended Contract provides for a surcharge equivalent to the power credit per acre-foot of water to be charged to water users, other than the United States or the State of California, for each acre-foot of project water determined to have been put to agricultural or manufacturing uses on excess land, for collection by the Agency <District> either itself or through a retail agency or another agency, for payment to the State of such surcharge, and for the allowance, on specified terms and conditions, of the amount of such surcharge as a
credit to the Agency <District>; and

WHEREAS, the Amended Contract establishes the power credit per acre-foot of water as
two dollars until all of the facilities for generation of electrical energy in connection with operation of initial project conservation facilities are installed and in operation, and provides for a redetermination of such credit thereafter to reflect accurately increases or decreases from year to year in the power credit; and

12

WHEREAS

WHEREAS, the provisions of the Amended Contract providing for or related to the power credit, surcharge and surcharge credit have been suspended as to water deliveries during the years prior to 1972 pending redetermination of the power credit and a reevaluation of the merits of such contract provisions; and
WHEREAS, estimates indicate that the power credit will be relatively negligible in amount and that administrative costs associated with the power credit, surcharge and surcharge credit provisions will be excessively burdensome to the Agency <District> and its water users;
and

WHEREAS, the power credit, surcharge and surcharge credit provisions rest on unclear,
confused or mistaken premises and should no longer be retained;

<Following added by Amendment No. 14>
WHEREAS, Article 28 of such water supply contract provides that the State shall redetermine the annual amounts of the Transportation Charge in order that the charges to the Agency <District> may accurately reflect increases or decreases from year to year in project costs, outstanding reimbursable indebtedness of the State, annual entitlements, estimated deliveries, project interest rate, and all other factors which are determinative of such charges; and
WHEREAS, Article 28 also provides that each such redetermination shall include an adjustment of the components of the Transportation Charge to be paid by the Agency <District> for succeeding years which shall account for differences, if any, between projections used by the
State in determining the amounts of such components for all preceding years and actual costs incurred by the State during such years, but does not specify the computational details or the method of payment of such adjustments; and
WHEREAS, the State has been including such adjustments as "one-shot" credits or
additional charges to be subtracted from or added to the Transportation Charge to be paid by the Agency <District> in the year following the redetermination; and

WHEREAS, the magnitude of such adjustments together with changes in other determinants of charges may be significantly different in comparison with the amounts projected by the State under previous determinations and could impair the planned fiscal operations of the
Agency <District>, depending on the method of payment, and the parties desire to amend the contract to provide a method of amortizing the payment of the amounts of such differences over two or more years, depending on the magnitude of the differences; and

13

WHEREAS

WHEREAS, bookkeeping will be simplified if the amortization of the payments of the amounts of such differences is reflected solely in the capital cost component of the
Transportation Charge; and
WHEREAS, the method of payment should apply regardless of whether the adjustments tend to increase or to decrease the Transportation Charge;

1972 entitlement taking into consideration the monthly distribution of 1972 project water deliveries as requested in its five-year delivery schedule submitted to the State in 1967; and
WHEREAS, the Agency <District> has requested that its annual entitlement for the first
year of water deliveries be decreased accordingly; and

WHEREAS, the State has determined that a decrease from 254,200 acre-feet to
154,772 acre-feet is justified and that allowing such a decrease in the Agency's <District> 1972 annual entitlement will not impair the financial feasibility of the project facilities;
<Following added by Amendment No. 16>

Such reports shall include all estimates, projections, and other data which the State deems relevant thereto.

(d) Bond funds required to be expended for the construction of additional facilities of the System under the provisions of Section 12938 of the Water Code shall be expended only for construction of additional project conservation facilities as defined herein, and related, appurtenant facilities necessary and desirable to meet local needs: part or all of such bond Provided, That if at any time after 1985 the State finds that a funds are not then required for the above purpose, and will not be so required within the next succeeding ten (10) years, such bond funds may be used, to the extent permitted in the Bond Act, to construct supplemental conservation facilities as defined herein.

(e) In planning and designing supplemental conservation facilities the State shall give consideration to the requirements and demands for supplemental water of the District and others who have contracted for project water. Entitlements to supplemental water shall be obtained, and repayment therefore shall be arranged, in contracts separate
from contracts for project water.
17. Construction of Project Facilities.

(a) 30 Subject to the rights of the District under subdivision (b) of this article and the other provisions of this contract, the State shall provide in each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities, other than the East Branch Aqueduct and the West Branch Aqueduct, such maximum monthly delivery capability for the transport and delivery of project water to the District as, in the judgment of the State, will best serve the interests of the District and all other contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or through said facilities: Provided, That within three (3) months after either the effective date of this contract or the execution of any amendments to this contract pursuant to the first proviso in Article 2, whichever is later, the District shall furnish to the State a written request specifying such maximum monthly delivery capabilities, and

30 Amended: Amendment 3

46

Articles 17(a), 17(b)

the State shall give full consideration to such request in planning and designing said facilities. On or before June 30, 1963, the District shall furnish to the State its written
request specifying, subject to Articles 6(b), 7(b), 12(b), and 12(c), the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each reach, including reservoirs, of the East Branch Aqueduct and of the West Branch Aqueduct for the transport and delivery of project water to the District, and specifying from which of said Branch Aqueducts the District shall receive water in the year of initial water delivery to the District and the year in which the first delivery of project water from the other of said Branch Aqueducts shall be made to the District. Such maximum monthly delivery capabilities and timing of first deliveries of project water from said Branch Aqueducts shall be as so requested by the
District:

Provided, That the District shall not specify less than a total maximum monthly delivery capability of sixty-one thousand two hundred sixty-five (61,265) acre-feet in each of said Branch Aqueducts for the transport and delivery of project water to the District, and the District's payment obligation under the Transportation Charge for said Branch Aqueducts shall be in accordance therewith unless the District requests a greater total maximum monthly delivery capability in either or both of said Branch Aqueducts pursuant to this subdivision: Provided further, That in the event said request by the District with respect to the timing of first deliveries of project water to the District from said Branch Aqueducts is, in the judgment of the State, incompatible with similar requests received from other contractors to be served from or through said Branch Aqueducts, which contractors have executed contracts with the State on or before June 30, 1963, the timing of first deliveries of project water to the District and such other contractors from said Branch Aqueducts shall be as established by mutual agreement among the State, the District, and said contractors: Provided further, That if such agreement has not been reached on or before December 31, 1963, the State may then construct said Branch Aqueducts in accordance with such construction schedules as, in the judgment of the State, will best serve the interest of all serve the interests of all those contractors whose service areas are located south of the South Portal of the Tehachapi Tunnels and which have executed contracts with the State on or before June 30, 1963.

(b) 31 The State shall design and construct the project transportation facilities SO as to provide for each reach thereof, including reservoirs, the capacity necessary to
enable delivery of project water in each year to the District and to other contractors in the maximum monthly amounts and at the locations, times, and maximum rates specified or provided for in their respective contracts for such year, and shall include in each such
reach such capacity as is economically justified in the judgment of the State to

31 Amended: Amendment 2

47

Articles 17(b), 17(c), 17(d)

compensate for scheduled outages for purposes of necessary investigation, inspection, maintenance, repair or replacement of project facilities, and for losses of water due to evaporation, leakage, seepage, or other causes. Subject to Articles 6(b), 7(b), 12(b), and 12(c), the capacity so to be provided by the State for each reach of the project transportation facilities necessary for transporting water to the District shall be sufficient to enable delivery to the District in each month of any year of an amount of water up to but not exceeding eleven percent (11%) of the District's annual entitlement for the respective year and, upon completion of the project facilities, to enable delivery to the District in each month of any year of an amount of water up to but not exceeding eleven percent (11%) of the District's maximum annual entitlement: Provided, That regulatory storage reservoirs included in the project transportation facilities may be utilized in conjunction with conveyance capacity provided in said facilities for delivery to the District of the foregoing monthly amounts, subject to the retention at all times, except during periods of emergency, in each reservoir on the East Branch Aqueduct and the West Branch Aqueduct, respectively, of an amount of stored water reasonably sufficient to meet emergency requirements of the District for project water during the respective year: Provided further, That excess capacity shall be provided in accordance with Article 47(c) of this contract.

(c) The District shall have a reasonable opportunity to inspect and study the State's plans and specifications for all project facilities during the planning stage and prior to the solicitation of bids for the construction thereof, and may make comments and recommendations thereon to the State. Such privilege shall also extend to any plans and specifications or proposed agreements for the use by the State, in conjunction with the project facilities, of facilities owned by an entity other than the State. The State shall not enter into any such agreement which would impair the State's ability to perform fully its
obligations under this contract.

(d) No bonds shall be sold nor funds expended under the authority of the Bond Act for the construction of any aqueduct or appurtenance thereto included in the System unless and until contracts are executed which will insure the recovery by the State of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of those capital costs of the particular aqueduct and any appurtenances thereto which shall be reimbursable by the contractors as determined by the State; nor shall any bonds be sold or funds expended under the authority of the Bond Act for the construction of any project conservation facility or supplemental conservation facility, unless and until contracts are executed which, together with estimated revenues from the sale or other disposal of electrical energy generated in connection with operation of project conservation facilities and supplemental conservation facilities, will insure the recovery by the State of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of those capital costs of the particular facility which shall be reimbursable

48

Articles 17(d), 17(e), 17(f)

by the contractors as determined by the State: Provided, That the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect to: (1) surveys, engineering studies, exploratory work, designs, preparation of construction plans and specifications, acquisition of lands, easements and rights of way, relocation work, and essential administrative work in connection therewith; (2) construction for which appropriations had been made prior to approval of the Bond Act by the voters of the State of California; and (3) construction of facilities pursuant to an agreement between the State and the United States.

(e) The State shall make all reasonable efforts to commence construction of
the project transportation facilities on or before June 30, 1963. In the event that no
contract for construction of project transportation facilities south of the San Luis Canal of the San Luis unit of the Federal Central Valley Project has been let on or before December 31, 1964, and that no bonds have been issued nor funds expended for construction of said facilities by that date, the District at any time after December 31, 1964, may at its option terminate this contract by giving notice of such termination to the State, such termination to be effective six (6) months after the giving of such notice, whereupon both parties hereto shall be relieved of all further obligations hereunder: Provided, That if the District has not theretofore given such notice, this option shall expire upon the letting by the State of a contract for construction of said facilities at any time after March 31, 1965.

(f) In the event that the State fails or is unable to complete construction of any portion or portions of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the District as provided in this contract, and gives the District written notice thereof, or by reason of such failure or inability construction of said facilities has ceased for a period of two and one-half (2-1/2) years, the District, if it be not then in default and without
exclusion of such other rights as it may have under this contract, may exercise the following options:

(1) The District may provide funds to the State in such amounts and at such times as may be necessary to enable the State to complete construction of such uncompleted portion or portions of the project transportation facilities to the extent necessary for the transport and delivery of water to the District as provided for in this contract: Provided, That the State shall be and remain the owner of such
project transportation facilities or portions thereof constructed in whole or in part with funds provided by the District, and shall be and remain obligated to operate, maintain, repair and replace such facilities to the full extent contemplated in this contract: Provided further, That the amount of any funds so provided by the District shall be credited by the State against the District's payment obligation under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge, but the District shall be and remain obligated to pay its share of any capital costs of the above-described facilities not paid for with such funds, together with its proportionate share of the operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs of such facilities.

49

Articles 17(f), 17(g)

(2) The District may at its own expense, and on a joint venture basis if such an arrangement is made with other contractors having similar options, connect to the project transportation facilities constructed by the State for the purpose of receiving project water to which it is entitled under this contract. In such event and notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, the structures for delivery of project water to the District pursuant hereto shall thereafter be deemed to be located at such point of connection. Specific arrangements for acquiring, constructing, operating, maintaining and replacing the District's facilities at the point of connection thereof with the State's facilities shall be in accordance with terms and conditions mutually agreed upon by the parties: Provided, That the State shall be and remain the owner of all facilities constructed by it to said point of connection, and the District shall be and remain obligated to pay its proportionate share of the costs thereof.

(g) 32 Adjustments Due to Supplemental Financing Costs.

(1) If contractor, with approval of the State, advances funds to the State to assist the State in financing construction of project facilities (except advances for delivery structures, measuring devices and excess capacity and also excepting advances made under Article 47(m) of this contract), such advance shall be amortized by means of annual credits to the contractor having made such advance of funds to the State, with such credits being equal to the actual bond service obligations payable by such contractor by reason of such advance or, if no bonded debt was incurred, then such credits shall be sufficient to cover the repayment of principal and interest costs which would have resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose of funding the advance as determined
by the State.

(2) If, after May 1, 1969, any source of funds other than those provided by the Bond Act is employed to finance construction of specific project facilities, any additional costs incurred because of such financing will not be charged to the contractors, except for adjustments to the "project interest rate".

18. 33 Shortage in Water Supply,

(a) Shortages; Delivery Priorities.
In any year in which there may occur a shortage due to drought or any other cause whatsoever, in the supply of project water available for delivery to the contractors, with the result that such supply is less than the total of the annual entitlements of all contractors for
that year, the State shall allocate the available supply in proportion to each contractor's annual entitlement as set forth in its Table A for that year and shall reduce the allocation of project water to each contractor using such water for agricultural purposes and to each contractor using such water for other purposes by the same percentage of their respective annual entitlements for that year: Provided, that the State may allocate on some other basis if such is required to meet minimum demands of contractors for domestic supply, fire protection, or sanitation during the year. If a contractor is allocated more water than it requested, the excess water shall be reallocated among the other contractors in proportion to their annual entitlements as provided for above: The foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall be inoperative to the extent necessary to comply with subdivision (c) of this article and to the extent that a contractor's annual entitlement for the respective year reflects established rights under the area of origin statutes precluding a reduction in deliveries to such
contractor.

(b) 34 (Deleted.)

(c) 35 Permanent Shortage; Contracts for Areas-of-Origin.
In the event that the State, because of the establishment by a party of a prior right to water under the provisions of Sections 11460 through 11463 of the Water Code, enters into a contract with such party for a dependable supply of project water, which contract will cause a permanent shortage in the supply of project water to be made available to the District hereunder:

(1) The State shall: (i) equitably redistribute the costs of all transportation facilities included in the System among all contractors for project water, taking into account the diminution of the supply to the District and other prior contractors in accordance with the terms of their contracts, and (ii) revise the District's annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlement, by amendment of Table A of this contract to correspond to the reduced supply of project water to be made available to the District: Provided, That such redistribution of costs of transportation facilities shall not be made until there has been reasonable opportunity for the District to exercise the option provided for in (2) below, and for other prior contractors to exercise similar options.

51

Articles 18(c), 18(d), 18(e)

(2) The District, at its option, shall have the right to use any of the project transportation facilities which by reason of such permanent shortage in the supply of project water to be made available to the District are not required for delivery of project water to the District, to transport water procured by it from any other source: Provided, That such use shall be within the limits of the capacities provided in the project transportation facilities for service to the District under this contract: Provided further, That, except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the Water Code be changed, the District shall not use the project transportation facilities under this option to transport water the right to which was secured by the District through eminent domain unless such use be approved by the Legislature by concurrent resolution with a majority of the members elected to each house voting in favor thereof. This option shall terminate upon a redistribution of costs of transportation facilities by the State pursuant to (1) above. In the event that this option is exercised, the State shall take such fact into account in making such redistribution of costs, and shall offset such use as is made of the project transportation facilities pursuant thereto against any reduction in the District's payment obligation hereunder resulting from such redistribution of costs.

(d) Reinstatement of Entitlements.

If after any revision of annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlements pursuant to subdivision (c) of this article, circumstances arise which, in the judgment of the State, justify a revision upward of the same, the State shall, with the consent of the affected contractor, reinstate proportionately the previously reduced entitlements of such contractor to the extent deemed justified, and shall equitably redistribute the costs of the project transportation facilities if inequities would otherwise occur as a result of such reinstatement of entitlements.

(e) Advance Notice of Delivery Reductions.
The State shall give the District written notice as far in advance as possible of any reduction in deliveries to it which is to be made under subdivision (a) of this article and, to the extent possible, shall give the District written notice five (5) years in advance of any reduction in its annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlement under subdivision (c) of this article. Reports submitted to the District pursuant to Article 16(c) may constitute such notices.

Action taken pursuant to this article shall not deprive the State of or limit any remedy provided by this contract or by law for the recovery of money due or which may become due under this contract.

21. 36 Interruptible Water Service.

(a) Allocation of Interruptible Water.
Each year from water sources available to the project, the State shall make available and allocate interruptible water to contractors in accordance with the procedure in Article 18(a). Allocations of interruptible water in any one year may not be carried over for delivery in a subsequent year, nor shall the delivery of interruptible water in any year impact a contractor's approved deliveries of annual entitlement or the contractor's allocation of water for the next year. Deliveries of interruptible water in excess of a contractor's annual entitlement may be made if the deliveries do not adversely affect the State's delivery of annual entitlement to other contractors or adversely affect project operations. Any amounts of water owed to the District as of the date of this amendment pursuant to former Article 12(d), any contract provisions or letter agreements relating to wet weather water, and any Article 14(b) balances accumulated prior to 1995, are canceled. The State shall hereafter use its best efforts, in a manner that causes no adverse impacts upon other contractors or the project, to avoid adverse economic impacts due to a contractor's inability to take water during wet weather.

(b) Rates.

For any interruptible water delivered pursuant to this article, contractors shall pay the State the same (including adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water as if such interruptible water were entitlement water, as well as all incremental operation,

Articles 21(b), 21(c), 22(a), 22(b)

maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State. The State shall not include any administrative or contract preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those non-power costs, which would not be incurred if interruptible water were not scheduled for or delivered to the contractor. Only those contractors not participating in the repayment of the capital costs of a reach shall be required to pay any use of facilities charge for the delivery of interruptible water through that reach.

(c) Contracts.

To obtain a supply of interruptible water, a contractor shall execute a further contract with the State which shall be in conformity with this article and shall include at least provisions concerning the scheduling of deliveries of interruptible water and times and methods of payment.

C. PAYMENT PROVISIONS

22. Delta Water Charge.

(a) The payments to be made by each contractor for project water shall include an annual charge designated as the Delta Water Charge. This charge, together with the total revenues derived during the project repayment period from the sale or other disposal of electrical energy generated in connection with operation of project conservation facilities, shall return to the State during the project repayment period all costs of the project conservation facilities incurred during the project repayment period, including capital, operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs, which are allocated to the purpose of water conservation in, above, and below the Delta pursuant to subdivision (e) of this article. Wherever reference is made, in connection with the computation or determination of the Delta Water Charge, to the costs of any facility or facilities included in the System, such reference shall be only to those costs of such facility or facilities which are reimbursable by the contractors as determined by the State.

(b) 37 For cach contractor receiving project water in any year through December 31, 1969, the Delta Water Charge shall be the product of $3.50 and the contractor's annual entitlement to project water for the respective year.

additional project conservation facilities: Provided, That if the agreement with such federal agency allows repayment of costs of a portion of a facility to be deferred, the associated costs of such portion shall be excluded from the Delta Water Charge computations until repayment of such deferred costs or interest thereon is commenced by the State: Provided further, That all costs of additional project conservation facilities incurred prior to the award of a major construction contract, shall be included in the Delta Water Charge computations in the year in which they are incurred.

(f) The rates to be used in determining the components of the Delta Water Charge pursuant to subdivision (d) of this article and to become effective on January 1, 1970, shall be computed by the State in accordance with subdivision (c) of this article prior to that date. Such computation shall include an adjustment which shall account for the difference, if any, between revenues received by the State under the Delta Water Charge prior to January 1, 1970, and revenues which would have been received under the charge prior to that date had it been computed and charged in accordance with subdivisions (c) and (d) of this article. Upon such computation, a document establishing such rates shall be prepared by the State and attached to this contract as an amendment of this article. The State shall recompute such rates each year thereafter, and each such recomputation shall take account of and reflect increases or decreases from year to year in projected costs, outstanding reimbursable indebtedness of the State incurred to construct the project conservation facilities described in subdivision (e) of this article, annual entitlements, deliveries of project water, project interest rate, revenues from the sale or other disposal of electrical energy, and all other factors which are determinative of such rates. In addition, each such recomputation shall include an adjustment of the rates for succeeding years which shall account for the differences, if any, between projections of costs used by the State in determining said rates for all preceding years, and actual costs incurred by the State during such years. Upon each such recomputation, an appropriately revised copy of the document establishing such rates shall be prepared by the State and attached to this contract as an amendment of this article.

(g) 39 Upon the construction of the supplemental conservation facilities, the Delta Water Charge shall be paid by all contractors for supplemental water, as well as by contractors for project water, and, together with revenues derived from the sale or other disposal of electrical energy generated in connection with operation of project conservation facilities and supplemental conservation facilities, shall return to the State, in addition to those costs of the project conservation facilities allocated to the purpose of water conservation, in, above, and below the Delta pursuant to subdivision (e) of this article, all costs of such supplemental conservation facilities, including capital,

24. Transportation Charge -- Capital Cost Component.

(a) The capital cost component of the Transportation Charge shall be
sufficient to return to the State those capital costs of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the contractor, which are allocated to the contractor pursuant to subdivision (b) of this article. The amount of this component shall be determined in two steps as follows: (1) an allocation of capital costs to the contractor, and (2) a computation of annual payment of such allocated capital costs and interest thereon, computed at the project interest rate, to be made by the contractor.

(b) 43 In the first step, the total amount of capital costs of each aqueduct reach to be returned to the State shall be allocated among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach by the proportionate use of facilities method of cost allocation and in accordance with (1) and (2) below. The measure of the proportionate use of each contractor of each reach shall be the average of the following two ratios: (i) the ratio of the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach to the total of the maximum annual entitlements of all contractors to be delivered from or through the reach from the year in which charges are
to be paid through the end of the project repayment period and (ii) the ratio of the
capacity provided in the reach for the transport and delivery of project water to the contractor to the total capacity provided in the reach for the transport and delivery of project water to all contractors served from or through the reach from the year in which charges are to be paid through the end of the project repayment period. Allocations of capital costs to the District pursuant hereto shall be on the basis of relevant values which
will be set forth in Table B by the State as soon as designs and cost estimates are prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the District as to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities for the transport and delivery of project water to the District, pursuant to Article 17(a): Provided, That these values shall be subject to redetermination
by the State in accordance with Article 28: Provided further, That the principles and procedures set forth in this subdivision shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs to the District. Proportionate use of facilities factors for prior years shall not be adjusted by the State in response to changes or transfers of entitlement among contractors unless otherwise agreed by the State and the parties to the transfer and unless there is no
impact on past charges or credits of other contractors.

Article 24(b)

(1) The total amount of capital costs allocated to a contractor shall be
the sum of the products obtained when there is multiplied, for each aqueduct reach necessary to deliver water to the contractor, the total amount of the capital costs of the reach to be returned to the State under the Transportation Charge by the average of the two foregoing ratios for such reach as said average is set forth in the appropriate table included in its contract.

(2) In the event that excess capacity is provided in any aqueduct reach
for the purpose of making project water available in the future to an agency or agencies with which the State has not executed contracts at the time of any allocation of costs pursuant to this subdivision, the prospective maximum annual entitlement or entitlements to be supplied by such excess capacity, as determined by the State, shall be deemed to be contracted for by said agency or agencies for the purpose of such allocation of costs, to the end that the capital costs of providing such excess capacity are not charged to any contractor entitled by virtue
of an executed contract to the delivery of project water from or through that
aqueduct reach at the time of such allocation. Where additional capacity is
provided in any aqueduct reach to compensate for loss of water due to evaporation, leakage, seepage, or other causes, or to compensate for scheduled outages for purposes of necessary investigation, inspection, maintenance, repair or
replacement of the facilities of the project facilities, then, for the purpose of any
allocation of costs pursuant to this subdivision: (i) the maximum annual
entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach of each contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach shall be increased by an amount which bears the same proportion to the maximum annual delivery capability provided by such additional capacity that the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach bears to the total of the maximum annual entitlements to be delivered from or through the reach under all contracts; and (ii) the capacity provided in the reach for each contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach shall be increased
in the same proportion that the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be
delivered from or through the reach is increased pursuant to (i) above.

(3) The projected amounts of capital costs to be allocated annually to the District under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge shall be determined by the State in accordance with the cost allocation principles and
procedures set forth in this subdivision, which principles and procedures shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs to the District. Such amounts will be
set forth in Table C by the State as soon as designs and cost estimates are prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the District as to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each aqueduct reach for transport and delivery of project water to the District, pursuant to Article 17(a):

25. Transportation Charge -- Minimum Operation, Maintenance, Power, and
Replacement Component.

(a) The minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the Transportation Charge shall return to the State those costs of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the contractor which constitute
operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs incurred irrespective of the amount
of project water delivered to the contractor and which are allocated to the contractor pursuant to (b) below: Provided, That to the extent permitted by law, the State may establish reserve funds to meet anticipated minimum replacement costs; and deposits in such reserve funds by the State: (1) shall be made in such amounts that such reserve funds will be adequate to meet such anticipated costs as they are incurred, and (2) shall be deemed to be part of the minimum replacement costs for the year in which such deposits are made.

(b) The total projected minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs of each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities for the respective year shall be allocated among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from said facilities by the proportionate use of facilities method of cost allocation, in the same manner and upon the same bases as are set forth for the allocation of capital costs in Article 24: Provided, That such minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs as are incurred generally for the project transportation facilities first shall be allocated to each aqueduct reach in an amount which bears the same proportion to the total amount of such general costs that the amount of the costs incurred directly for the reach bears to the total of all direct costs for all aqueduct reaches.

(c) The amount to be paid each year by the District under the minimum
operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the Transportation Charge shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (b) of this article on the basis of the
relevant values to be set forth for the respective aqueduct reaches in Table B, included in Article 24: Provided, That these values shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 28. Such amounts and any interest thereon shall be set forth by
the State in Table E as soon as designs and cost estimates have been prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the District as to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each aqueduct reach for transport and delivery of project water to the District, pursuant to Article 17(a): Provided, That the amounts set forth in
Table E shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 28.

Article 25(d)

(d) 47 Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this Article, or of Article 1(u), the costs of off-aqueduct power facilities shall be determined and allocated as follows:

(1) The off-aqueduct power costs shall include all annual costs the State incurs for any off-aqueduct power facility, which shall include, but not be limited to, power purchases, any annual principal and interest payments on funds borrowed by or advanced to the State, annual principal and interest on bonds issued by the State or other agency, or under revenue bond financing contracts, any requirements for coverage, deposits to reserves, and associated operation and maintenance costs of such facility, less any credits, interest earnings, or other
monies received by the State in connection with such facility. In the event the State finances all or any part of an off-aqueduct power facility directly from funds other than bonds or borrowed funds, in lieu of such annual principal and interest payments, the repayment of capital costs as to that part financed by such other funds shall be determined on the basis of the schedule that would have been
required under Article 24.

(2) The annual costs of off-aqueduct power facilities as computed in (1) above shall initially be allocated among contractors in amounts which bear the same proportions to the total amount of such power costs that the total estimated electrical energy (kilowatt hours) required to pump through project transportation facilities the desired delivery amounts of annual entitlements for that year, as
submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1) and as may be modified by the State pursuant to Article 12(a)(2), bears to the total estimated electrical energy (kilowatt hours) required to pump all such amounts for all contractors through project transportation facilities for that year, all as determined by the State.

(3) 48 An interim adjustment in the allocation of the power costs calculated in accordance with (2) above, may be made in May of each year based
on April revisions in approved schedules of deliveries of project and nonproject water for contractors for such year. A further adjustment shall be made in the following year based on actual deliveries of project and nonproject water for contractors; provided, however, in the event no deliveries are made through a pumping plant, the adjustments shall not be made for that year at that plant.

47 Added: Amendment 18
48 Amended: Amendment 25

75

Articles 25(d), 25(e), 25(f), 26(a)

(4) To the extent the monies received or to be received by the State from all contractors for off-aqueduct power costs in any year are determined by the State to be less than the amount required to pay the off-aqueduct power costs in such year, the State may allocate and charge that amount of off-aqueduct power costs to the District and other contractors in the same manner as costs under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge are allocated and charged. After that amount has been so allocated, charged and collected, the State shall provide a reallocation of the amounts allocated pursuant to this paragraph (4), such reallocation to be based on the allocations made pursuant to (2) and (3) above for that year, or in the event no such allocation was made for that year, on the last previous allocation made pursuant to (2) and (3) above. Any such reallocation shall include appropriate interest at the project interest rate.

(e) 49 The total minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement component due that year from each contractor shall be the sum of the allocations made under the proportionate use of facilities method provided in subdivision (b) of this article and the allocations made pursuant to subdivision (d) of this article for each contractor.

(f) 5O Notwithstanding provisions of Articles 25(a) through 25(c) and 25(e), minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs associated with deliveries through East Branch Enlargement Facilities as defined in Article 49(a) shall be collected under the minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge [Article 49(e)].

26. Transportation Charge - Variable Operation, Maintenance, Power, and
Replacement Component.

(a) The variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the Transportation Charge shall return to the State those costs of the project
transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the contractor which constitute operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs incurred in an amount which is dependent upon and varies with the amount of project water delivered to the contractor and which are allocated to the contractor pursuant to (1) and (2) below: Provided, That to the extent permitted by law, the State may establish reserve funds to meet anticipated variable replacement costs; and deposits in such reserve funds by the State: (1) shall be made in such amounts that such reserve funds will be adequate to meet such anticipated costs as they are incurred, and (2) shall be deemed to be a part of the variable replacement costs for the year in which such deposits are made. The amount of this component shall be determined as follows:

76

Articles 26(a), 26(b), 26(c)

(1) There shall be computed for each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities charge per acre-foot of water which will return to the
State the total projected variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs of the reach for the respective year. This computation shall be made by dividing said total by the number of acre-feet of project water estimated to be delivered from or through the reach to all contractors during the year.

(2) The amount of the variable component shall be the product of the sum of the charges per acre-foot of water, determined under (1) above, for each aqueduct reach necessary to deliver water to the contractor, and the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor during the year: Provided, That when project water has been a requested by a contractor and delivery thereof has been commenced by the State, and, through no fault of the State, such water is wasted as a result of failure or refusal by the contractor to accept delivery thereof, the amount of said variable component to be paid by such contractor during such period shall be the product of the above sum and the sum of the number of
acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor and the number of acre-feet
wasted.

(b) There shall be credited against the amount of the variable component to be paid by each contractor, as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of this article, a portion of the projected net value of any power recovered during the respective year at project aqueduct power recovery plants located upstream on the particular aqueduct from the delivery structures for delivery of project water to the contractor. Such portion shall be in an amount which bears the same proportion to said projected net value that the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor through said plants during the year bears to the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to all contractors through said plants during the year.

(c) The amount to be paid each year by the District under the variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the Transportation Charge shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (a) of this article for the respective aqueduct reaches in Table B, included in Article 24. Such amounts and any interest thereon shall be set forth by the State in Table F as soon as designs and cost estimates are prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the District as to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each aqueduct reach for transport and delivery of project water to the District, pursuant to Article 17(a): Provided, That the amounts set forth in Table F shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 28.

28. 52 Transportation Charge -- Redetermination.

(a) Determinative Factors Subject to Retroactive Change.
The State shall redetermine the values and amounts set forth in Tables B, C, D, E, F, and G of this contract in the year following the year in which the State commences construction of the project transportation facilities and each year thereafter in order that the Transportation Charge to the Agency <District> and the components thereof may accurately reflect the increases or decreases from year to year in projected costs, outstanding reimbursable indebtedness of the State incurred to construct the project transportation facilities described in Table I of this contract, annual entitlements, estimated deliveries, project interest rate, and all other factors which are determinative of
such charges. In addition, each such redetermination shall include an adjustment of the components of the Transportation Charge to be paid by the Agency <District> for succeeding years which shall account for the differences, if any, between those factors used by the State in determining the amounts of such components for all preceding years and the factors as then currently known by the State. Such adjustment shall be computed by the State and paid by the Agency <District> or credited to the Agency's <District's> account in the manner described in (b) and (c) below.

(b) Adjustment: Transportation Charge -- Capital Cost Component.
Adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge to the Agency <District, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon computed at the then current project interest rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination, shall be paid in the year following the redetermination: Provided, That the Agency <District> may elect to exercise the option whereby when the redetermined Transportation Charge for the following year, with adjustments, including adjustments of the operation, maintenance, power, and replacement components provided for in subdivision (c) of this article, is more or less than the last estimate of the Charge provided pursuant to Article 27 for the corresponding year, without adjustments, an amount equal to the total of such difference shall be deducted from or added to the adjusted capital cost component for that year and paid or credited in accordance with the following schedule:

more than 30%, but not more than 40% 4
more than 40%. 5

Such payments or credits shall be equal semi-annual amounts of principal and interest on or before the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July, with interest computed at the project interest rate and compounded annually, during varying amortization periods as set forth in the preceding schedule: Provided, That for the purpose of determining the above differences in the Transportation Charge, the variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component shall be computed on the basis of the same estimated project water deliveries as was assumed in computing pursuant to Article 26(c).

(c) Adjustment: Transportation Charge -- Minimum and Variable
Components.

One-twelfth of the adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the Agency's <District's> minimum and variable operation, power, and replacement components for each year shall be added or credited to the corresponding components to be paid in the corresponding month of the year following the redetermination, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon computed at the then current project interest rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination.

(d) Exercise of Option.

The option provided for in subdivision (b) above shall be exercised in writing on or before the January 1 due date of the first payment of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge for the year in which the option is to become effective.
Such option, once having been exercised, shall be applicable for all of the remaining years of the project repayment period.

84

Articles 28(e), 28(f), 29(a), 29(b)

(e) 53 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 28(b), adjustments for prior overpayments and underpayments shall be repaid beginning in the year following the redetermination by application of a unit rate per acre-foot which, when paid for the projected portion of the Agency's <District's> annual entitlement will return to the State, during the project repayment period, together with interest thereon computed at the project interest rate and compounded annually, the full amount of the adjustments resulting from financing after January 1, 1987, from all bonds, advances, or loans listed in Article 1(r) <1(t)> except for Article 1(r)(3)<1(t)3> and except for bonds issued by the State under the Central Valley Project Act after January 1, 1987 for facilities not listed among the water system facilities in Article 1(hh). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding exception, such amortization shall also apply to any adjustments in this component charge resulting from a change in the project interest rate due to any refunding after January 1, 1986 on bonds issued under the Central Valley Project Act. However, amortization of adjustments resulting from items (1)(r)(4) <1(t)(4)> through (T) shall be limited to a period which would allow the Department to repay the debt service on a current basis until such time as bonds are issued to reimburse the source of such funding. In no event shall this amortization period be greater than the project repayment period.

(f) 53 Adjustment: Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs. The use of water system revenue bonds for financing facilities listed in Article 1(hh) would result in adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge to the Agency <District> under the provisions of this article; however, in place of making such adjustments, charges to the Agency <District> will be governed by Article 50.

29. Time and Method of Payment.

Such yearly funds shall be in an amount which bears the same proportion to the total capital costs of each such reach to be incurred during that year, including the costs of providing for such excess capacity, as such excess capacity bears to the total capacity of such reach, including such excess capacity. Upon completion of construction of each aqueduct reach in which excess capacity is provided but prior to completion of all such aqueduct reaches, there shall be a determination as to such reach, of: (I) each annual cost attributable to such excess capacity, determined by the annual differences between the estimated cost which would have been incurred had no excess capacity been provided and the actual cost incurred, and (2) each annual payment as determined above. The amount by which each such annual payment exceeds the associated annual cost shall be credited to the installment for other excess capacities due January 1 of the following year, with interest on separate halves of such amount from the dates payments were made on the respective installments of such annual payment at the applicable apportionment rate of the Surplus Money Investment Fund, compounded semiannually. The amount by which each such annual cost exceeds the associated annual payment shall be debited to the installment for other excess capacities due January 1 of the following year, with interest on separate halves of such amount from January 1 and July 1, respectively, of the year such insufficient annual payment was made at the project interest rate, compounded annually. The State shall furnish the District, on or before July of cach year, a written statement of the charges to the District pursuant to this subdivision for the next year.

Article 49(b)

(2) The State shall construct the East Branch Enlargement Facilities in stages, with the first stage providing the District in each reach at least fifty percent of the capacity shown in the table set forth in Article 49(b)(1). The State shall determine the specific reach features to be enlarged in consultation with the Participating Contractors. All Participating Contractors which have capital cost repayment obligations in a reach shall be considered to have a minimum delivery capability in each stage. The minimum delivery capabilities of the Participating
Contractors in each staged reach shall be in the same proportion as the
Participating Contractor's proportion of the total enlargement capacity. The State
shall not construct Reaches 18A through 23 and 26A of the East Branch
Enlargement Facilities to capacities greater than shown in the following table
provided that power facilities may be constructed to a larger capacity if found by
the State to be economically or operationally justifiable after prior consultation
with the Participating Contractors.

(3) The State shall make all reasonable efforts to complete
construction of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities as specified above by July 1, 1991. If the State determines that construction of the first stage cannot be accomplished by July 1, 1991 without incurring extra costs, it shall consult with the Participating Contractors.

(4) The State shall make all reasonable efforts to complete
construction of any East Branch Enlargement Facilities necessary to accommodate the total of the constructed amount which are not completed as part of the first stage. It shall undertake further construction activities upon the
earliest of (1) the State's determination that delivery schedules submitted pursuant
to Article 12 justify such action or (2) a request by The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California that such action be taken. If the State fails to
complete construction of any portion or portions of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities one or more of the agencies may complete construction pursuant to the procedure in Article 17(f).

106

Articles 49(b), 49(c), 49(d)

(5) Upon completion of each stage of construction, the State shall
determine whether actual capacity of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities differs from contracted for capacity. If actual capacity differs from contracted for capacity, the capacity provided for transport and delivery of project water shall be proportionately adjusted by the State among the Participating Contractors.
(c) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge.
The payments to be made by each Participating Contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall include an annual charge under the designation East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge. This charge shall return to the State during the repayment period associated with financing of East Branch Enlargement Facilities, those costs of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities which are allocated to the Participating Contractor in accordance with the cost allocation principles and procedures hereinafter set forth. Wherever reference is made, in connection with the computation, determination, or payment of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge, to the costs of any facility or facilities included in the System, such reference shall be only to those costs of such facility or facilities which are reimbursable by the Participating Contractors as determined by the State. The East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge shall consist of a capital cost a component; and a minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component, as these components are defined in and determined under Articles 49(d) and 49(e), respectively. For the purpose of allocations of costs pursuant to said articles, the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be segregated into aqueduct reaches as set forth in Figure B-5 in State Bulletin 132-85, provided, however, that Reach 23 may be adjusted after consultation with the contractors as a result of a delivery point being changed.

(d) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge -- Capital Cost Component.

(1) Method of Computation.
Each Participating Contractor shall be allocated a capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge which shall be sufficient to return to the State those capital costs of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities which are allocated to the Participating Contractor pursuant to subdivision (d)(2) of this article. The amount of this charge shall be determined by an allocation of capital costs to the Participating Contractor and a computation of annual payments of such allocated costs and interest, if any, thereon to be made by the Participating Contractor pursuant to this article. The capital costs allocated to the District shall be reduced by payments advanced by the District pursuant to Article 9(d)(4).

107

Article 49(d)

(2) Allocation of Capital Costs Among Participating Contractors.
The total amount of capital costs of each reach of the enlargement to be returned to the State shall be allocated among all Participating Contractors on the basis of the ratio of the capacity provided in that reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the transport and delivery of project water to the Participating Contractor to the total capacity provided in that reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the transport and delivery of project water to all Participating Contractors served from or through the reach.

(3) Determination of Capital Cost Component.

The amount of this component shall be determined as follows:

(A) The total amount of capital costs allocated to a Participating Contractor shall be the sum of the products obtained when there is multiplied, for each enlargement reach, the total amount of the capital costs of the enlargement reach to be returned to the State under the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge by the ratio of the East Branch Enlargement capacity provided to make deliveries to the District in the reach in cubic feet per second (cfs),
as provided in subarticle 49(b)(1), to the total cfs capacity of the reach of
enlargement.

(B) The projected amounts of capital costs to be allocated annually to the District under the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge shall be determined by the State in accordance with the cost allocation principles and procedures set forth in Article 49(d)(3)(A), which principles and procedures shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs to the Participating Contractors. These amounts shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 49(g).

(4) Financing of Allocated Capital Costs by a Participating Contractor.

(A) The District may elect to a pay a portion or all of the capital costs of the enlargement construction allocated to the District by furnishing funds to the State in advance of the State incurring the capital costs, provided that the total remaining costs to be financed by the State shall not be less than $50 million. The District may elect in writing to use this option by June 15 of each year as to any portion of an East Branch Enlargement Facility not yet funded by the State. If the District does not elect this option by June 15 of a given year, it may, with the consent of the State elect the option at a later time in that year.

108

Article 49(d)

(B) For any year in which the District elects this option, the State shall, on or before July 1 furnish the District with a written statement a of estimated amounts of funds needed by the State in the succeeding year and of the calendar dates by which the State will need the funds. During each succeeding year the State shall, on the first of each month, notify the District of funds needed within the succeeding month. The District shall pay to the State the requested funds within fifteen calendar days of receipt of notification. The District may elect to advance funds to the State on an accelerated schedule acceptable to the State. Unless otherwise agreed to by the District and the State, interest earned on any funds advanced pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited to reduce payments due from the District under this contract. To the extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate. The District may terminate its use of this option for a given year with the agreement of the State. If the District elects this option, subparagraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this article shall not apply to any portion of capital costs to be paid pursuant to the option.

(C) If the District does not elect to pay all of the capital costs of the enlargement allocated to the District by furnishing funds to the State in advance, the State, after consultation with the District, shall prepare a plan for the State's financing of the East Branch Enlargement and shall give the District an opportunity to comment on the plan. The plan shall include but not be limited to the size of any revenue bond issuances and the form of necessary resolutions, articles and covenants.

(5) State Revenue Bond Financing of Allocated Capital Costs.

(A) Revenue Bond Charge.

If the District does not pay all of the capital costs allocated to the District pursuant to subparagraph (3) and the State issues revenue bonds to finance the enlargement construction, the portion of the capital costs not advanced pursuant to subparagraph (4) shall be recovered through a Revenue Bond Charge. The Revenue Bond Charges allocated to the Participating Contractors shall return to the State an amount equal to the financing costs the State incurs for that portion of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities constructed in whole or in part with funds from revenue bonds (including revenue bond anticipation notes). The elements of the financing costs shall include but not be limited to bond marketing expenses to the extent not financed from the proceeds of applicable revenue bond sales, interest expense during construction of the East

109

Article 49(d)

Branch Enlargement Facilities to the extent not provided for from bond proceeds, annual premiums for insurance or other security obtained
pursuant to Article 49(d)(5)(E), and all semi-annual East Branch Enlargement Facilities revenue bond requirements including principal and interest and, to the extent not funded in advance of any proposed bond sale, or at any time following such a sale, in accordance with Articles 49(d)(5)(C) and 49(d)(5)(D), any additional requirements for coverage and deposits to reserves as required under applicable resolutions for the issuance of East Branch Enlargement Facilities revenue bonds. Any credits which shall include, but not be limited to, interest earnings or other earnings of the State in connection with such bonds shall when and as permitted by the bond resolution first be utilized for East Branch Enlargement Facilities construction purposes and thereafter all rcalized earnings shall be paid the Participating Contractors at least semi-annually. Such earnings shall for the purpose of determining each non-defaulting Participating Contractor's portion of any remaining capital costs be credited and paid to each non-defaulting Participating Contractor on the same basis that the capital costs were allocated to each Participating
Contractor.

(B) Revenue Bond Charge Computation.

The Revenue Bond Charge for the East Branch Enlargement construction payable by the District shall be computed as follows. The capital costs allocable to the District pursuant to Article 49(d) shall be determined. Any amounts paid by the District pursuant to Article 49(d)(4) shall be subtracted. The resulting difference shall be divided by the total of all capital costs to be financed by revenue bonds. The ratio resulting from the division shall be applied to each element of the total revenue bond financing costs. Until such time as the actual costs to be used in the foregoing computation are known, such computation shall be based on estimates of such costs. The District's Revenue Bond Charge shall be paid by the District semiannually at least 40 days before the State is required to make the corresponding semi-annual payment to the
bondholders.

(C) Excess Coverage.
If the amount of coverage on any issue of revenue bonds, and interest earned on the coverage, is in excess of that required under the applicable bond resolution, articles or covenants, each participating contractor's share of the excess shall be in the same proportion as charges were paid by each participating contractor pursuant to Article 49(d)(5)(B)

110

Article 49(d)

for the portion of the facilities financed by said issue of revenue bonds. When and as permitted by the terms of the bond resolution, the share of excess coverage together with any realized interest earnings, shall at the Participating Contractor's option be returned to the Participating Contractor or be utilized to fund remaining East Branch Enlargement construction costs to the extent not otherwise provided for. To the extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate.

(D) Reserves.

The State shall maintain revenue bond reserve funds no greater than necessary, as required under the applicable bond resolution, articles or covenants. In determining the level of revenue bond reserves to be
maintained the State may, to the extent allowable under the applicable bond resolution, articles, or covenants, take account of any restricted reserve funds, other than replacement reserve funds, maintained by the individual Participating Contractors for the payment of State water contract payment obligations. Interest earned on revenue bond reserves maintained by the State and any excess reserve funds shall be credited promptly thereon to each Participating Contractor by the State. Upon retirement of any issue of revenue bonds and in accordance with the terms of the bond resolution, reserves maintained by the State on account of such issue, together with interest earnings thereon, shall be used to pay the final net annual debt service for such issue. Any reserves maintained by the State on account of an issue of revenue bonds and remaining after retirement of such issue, shall be repaid to the Participating Contractors in proportion to the total reserves that each Participating Contractor paid. To the extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate.

(E) Insurance.

To the extent economically justifiable, as determined by the State after consultation with the Participating Contractors, the State shall obtain insurance or maintain other security protecting bondholders and Participating Contractors against costs resulting from the failure of any Participating Contractor to make the payments required by this Article 49(d)(5).

111

Article 49(d)

(6) State Non-Revenue Bond Financing of Allocated Capital Costs.

The State may use any of its available funds other than revenue bonds, to finance all, or a portion of the capital costs of the enlargement construction. Until
revenue bonds or other debt instruments are issued, the Participating Contractors shall pay interest at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on whatever funds are used. Any State debt instrument other than revenue bonds or bond anticipation notes shall only be used after consultation with the Participating
Contractors.

(7) Reallocation of Costs.

No later than the date of completion of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, the State shall in consultation with the contractors
participating in the repayment of the reaches, reallocate costs for Reach 24 (Silverwood Lake). Such reallocation of costs shall apply to years beginning with the date of completion of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities. The State shall also reallocate at the same time the costs of Reach 25
(San Bernardino Tunnel) among all contractors participating in repayment of such reach, to reflect the redistribution of flow capacity necessary for the East Branch Enlargement Facilities. Such reallocation shall include historical as well as future costs as appropriate. By the same date the State, in consultation with the contractors participating in the repayment of the reaches, shall also reallocate all
costs associated with the work done pursuant to the letter agreement between the State and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California dated November 29, 1966 <Attachment B>, as described in Subarticle 49(a)(1)(B).

(8) Allocation of Improvement Costs.
Using the procedure provided in Article 24 (Transportation Charge-- Capital Cost Component) the State shall, as of the effective date of Article 49, allocate among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or
through the affected reaches those design and construction costs encompassed in letter agreements dated January 18, 1984 <Attachment F>, July 2, 1984 <Attachment G>, and May 15, 1985 <Attachment H>, between the State and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California which would have been
incurred irrespective of East Branch Enlargement Facilities. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall receive credits for principal and
interest at the project interest rate. Interest at the project interest rate shall be paid on funds advanced by The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, pursuant to the aforesaid letter agreements, in excess of the allocations made
pursuant to this subparagraph.

112

Articles 49(d), 49(e)

(9) Reimbursement for Previously Advanced East Branch Enlargement Costs.

If additional contractors become participants in Reach 25, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall, no later than the date of completion of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, receive credits with interest at rate of 6 percent for funds previously paid by it to the State for excess capacity in Reach 25 allocated to such additional contractors. By the same time, all existing contractors in Reach 25 will receive credits with interest at the project interest rate for any payments previously made by them with interest at the project interest rate, for basic capacity costs of Reach 25 to the extent those payments exceed the amounts they would have been obligated to pay if this amendment had been in effect as of the date funds were first paid. Tables B-1 and B-2 as shown in State Bulletin 132-70 shall be appropriately adjusted.

(e) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge - Minimum Operation, Maintenance, Power, and Replacement Component.

(1) The minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge shall return to the State those minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs which in the judgment of the State are incurred solely because of construction, operation and maintenance of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, and which are based on the proportional capital cost allocation to the District for such enlargement facilities, by reach. Other costs which cannot be attributed solely to East Branch facilities provided for pursuant to Article 17(a) shall be shared in accordance with a formula to be developed by the State in consultation with contractors participating in the repayment of the capital costs of the affected reaches. The State may establish reserve funds to meet anticipated minimum replacement costs in the same manner provided for in Article 25(a).

(2) The total projected minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs of each reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the respective year shall be allocated among all Participating Contractors on the basis
of the ratio of the capacity provided in the East Branch Enlargement Facilities reach for the transport and delivery of project water to each Participating Contractor to the total capacity provided in the East Branch Enlargement Facilities reach for the transport and delivery of project water to all Participating Contractors served from or through the reach.

113

Articles 49(e), 49(f), 49(g)

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this article, or of Article 1(u), the costs of off-aqueduct power facilities associated with deliveries of water through East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be included in the determinations and allocations pursuant to Article 25(d). There shall be no separate off-aqueduct power facilities determination and allocation for East Branch Enlargement Facilities.

(f) East Branch Enlargement Variable Operation, Maintenance, Power, and
Replacement Costs.

The variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs associated with deliveries of water through East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be included in the determinations and allocations pursuant to Article 26. There shall be no separate variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge.

(g) Redetermination of Charges.

(1) Determinative Factors Subject to Retroactive Charge.
The State shall redetermine the values and amounts chargeable to Participating Contractors in 1988 or the year following the year in which this article is effective, whichever is later, and each year thereafter as needed in order that the East Branch Enlargement charges to the District accurately reflect the increases or decreases from year to year in projected costs, properly attributable to each Participating Contractor. In addition, each such redetermination shall include an adjustment of the components of the charges to be paid by each Participating Contractor for succeeding years which shall account for the differences, if any, between those factors used by the State in determining the amounts of such components for all preceding years and the factors as then currently known by the State. Such adjustment shall be computed by the State and paid by the Participating Contractor or credited to the Participating Contractor's account in the manner described in Articles 49(g)(2) and 49(g)(3)
below.

(2) Adjustment: East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge -

Capital Cost Component.
Adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge to the Participating Contractor, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon

114

Articles 49(g), 49(h)

computed at the then current Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination, shall be paid in the year following the redetermination.

(3) Adjustment: East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge Minimum Operation, Maintenance, Power, and Replacement Component.
One-twelfth of the adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the Participating Contractor's minimum operation, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge for each year shall be added or credited and paid in the corresponding month of the year following the redetermination, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon computed at the then current Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year when the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination.

(h) East Branch Operation.
<Attachment J>

Requests for delivery of water through the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be subject to Article 12. Except as otherwise provided, the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be operated as an integral part of the East Branch Aqueduct and shall be subject to the same criteria. To the extent that then-current deliveries
involve rates of flow within the limitations of Article 12(b) or involve capacities less than those on which the contractor's capital charges are based, the State shall provide the deliveries with no power peaking charges. To the extent delivery capability is available to permit then-current deliveries at a rate of flow in excess of the lesser of that provided in (a) Article 12(b), or (b) of the sum of the capacities on which the District's capital charges are based in the basic East Branch Aqueduct Facilities and the District's proportional share of the operational capacity of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, such deliveries will be allowed if such deliveries do not adversely affect the ability of other contractors to receive entitlement deliveries. However, if such excess deliveries would cause increased power costs to any other contractors, the District shall pay the power costs that would otherwise increase power costs to the other water contractors. These power costs resulting from such excess deliveries will be based upon

115

Articles 49(h), 49(i), 50(a)

administrative cost allocation procedures adopted by the Director of the Department of Water Resources after consultation with the contractors. Before beginning deliveries that would involve extra power peaking charges, the State shall consult with the District to determine if the District desires (a) a change in its delivery schedule or (b) modifications in East Branch Aqueduct or Enlargement operation to avoid the increased power costs.

(i) Failure to Meet Payment Obligations Under Article 49.

(1) If a Participating Contractor defaults in payments due under Article 49 and the costs of other Participating Contractors would as a consequence be increased, the State shall, in addition to any actions taken pursuant to Articles 32 and 34, notify the defaulting Participating Contractor that if the Participating Contractor fails to cure the default within 30 days, the State will offer the capacity provided for the Participating Contractor to the other Participating Contractors. If the Participating Contractor fails to cure the default within thirty (30) days of notice by the State, the State shall offer to each Participating Contractor, in proportion to the contractor's degree of participation in the enlargement, the opportunity to assume responsibility for the capital charges and delivery capability on which the defaulting contractor's capital costs were based. If Participating Contractors fail to cure the default, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall assume responsibility for the capital charges on which the defaulting contractor's capital costs were based, and shall receive the capacity associated with such capital charges. Article 49(b)(1) shall be appropriately adjusted.

(2) No credits shall be assigned to a Participating Contractor under this article while the Participating Contractor is in default of any payment to the State under this article for a period of more than thirty (30) days.

50. 70 Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs.
<Attachment L>

(a) Charges to the Agency <District> for water system revenue bond financing costs shall be governed by provisions of this article. Charges to all contractors for water systems revenue bond financing costs shall return to the State an amount equal to the annual financing costs the State incurs in that year for water system revenue bonds (including water system revenue bond anticipation notes). Annual financing costs shall include, but not be limited to, any annual principal and interest on water system revenue bonds plus any additional requirements for bond debt service coverage, deposits to

70 Added: Amendment 20
116

Articles 50(a), 50(b), 50(c), 50(d)

reserves, and annual premiums for insurance or other security obtained pursuant to subdivision (f) of this article. The State shall provide credits to the contractors for excess reserve funds, excess debt service coverage, interest, and other earnings of the State in connection with repayment of such revenue bond financing costs, when and as permitted by the bond resolution. When such credits are determined by the State to be available, such credits shall be promptly provided to the contractors and shall be in proportion to the payments under this article from each contractor. Reserves, bond debt service coverage, interest, and other earnings may be used in the last year to retire the bonds.

(b) Annual charges to recover water systems revenue bond financing costs shall consist of two elements. <See Attachments K and L>

(1) The first element shall be an annual charge to the Agency <District> for repayment of capital costs of water system facilities as determined under Articles 22 and 24 of this contract with interest at the project interest rate. For conservation facilities, the charge shall be a part of the capital a cost component of the Delta Water Charge in accordance with Article 22. For transportation facilities, the charge shall be a part of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge in accordance with Article 24.

(2) The second element shall be the Agency's <District's> share of a Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge to be paid in lieu of a project interest rate adjustment. The total annual amount to be paid by all contractors under this element shall be the difference between the total annual charges under the first element and the annual financing costs of the water system revenue bonds. The amount to be paid by each contractor shall be calculated annually as if the project interest rate were increased to the extent necessary to produce revenues from all contractors sufficient to pay such difference for that year. In making that calculation, adjustments in the Agency's <District's> Transportation capital cost component charges for prior overpayments and underpayments shall be determined as if amortized over the remaining years of the project repayment period.

(c) The Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge will be identified by component and charge in the Agency's <District's> invoice.

(d) Timing of Payments. Payments shall be made in accordance with Article 29(f) of this contract.

117

Articles 50(e), 50(f), 50(g), 50(h)

(e) Reduction in Charges. The Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge under Articie 50(b)(2) shall cease for each series of water system revenue bonds when that series is fully repaid. However, the annual charge determined pursuant to Article 50(b)(1) shall continue to be collected for the time periods otherwise required under Articles 22 and 24. <See: Attachments T and U>

After the Department has repaid the California Water Fund in full and after each series of Water System Revenue Bonds is repaid, the Department will reduce the charges to all contractors in an equitable manner in a total amount that equals the amount of the charges under Article 50(b)(1) that the Department determines is not needed for future
financing of facilities of the System which, in whole or in part, will serve the purposes of the water supply contract with the Agency <District>.

(f) To the extent economically feasible and justifiable, as determined by the State after consultation with contractors, the State shall maintain insurance or other forms of security protecting bondholders and non-defaulting contractors against costs resulting from the failure of any contractor to make the payments required by this article.

(g) Before issuing each series of water system revenue bonds, the State shall consult with the contractors, prepare plan for the State's future financing of water system facilities, and give the Agency <District> an opportunity to comment on the plan. The plan shall include but not be limited to the size of any water system revenue bond issuances and the form of any necessary resolutions or supplements.

(h) Defaults.

(1) If a contractor defaults partially or entirely on its payment
obligations calculated under this article and sufficient insurance or other security protecting the non-defaulting contractors is not provided under Article 50(f), the State shall allocate a portion of the default to each non-defaulting contractor. The Agency's <District's> share of the default shall be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the total default amount to be charged to all non-defaulting contractors by the ratio that the Agency's <District's> maximum Table A entitlements bears to the maximum Table A entitlements of all non-defaulting contractors. However, such amount shall not exceed in any year 25 percent of the Water System Revenue Bond financing costs that are otherwise payable by the Agency District> in that year. The amount of default to be charged to non-defaulting contractors shall be reduced by any receipts from insurance protecting non-defaulting contractors and bond debt service coverage from a prior year and available for such purpose. <Attachment L>

118

Article 50(h)

(2) If a contractor defaults partially or entirely on its payment obligations under this article, the State shall also pursuant to Article 20, upon six months' notice to the defaulting contractor, suspend water deliveries under Article 20 to the defaulting Contractor so long as the default continues. The suspension of water deliveries shall be proportional to the ratio of the default to the total water system revenue bond payments due from the defaulting contractor. However, the State may reduce, eliminate, or not commence suspension of deliveries pursuant to this subparagraph if it determines suspension in the amounts otherwise required is likely to impair the defaulting contractor's ability to avoid further defaults or that there would be insufficient water for human
consumption, sanitation, and fire protection. The State may distribute the suspended water to the non-defaulting contractors on terms it determines to be equitable.

(3) During the period of default, credits otherwise due the defaulting contractor shall be applied to payments due from the defaulting contractor.

(4) Except as otherwise provided in Article 50(h)(3), the defaulting contractor shall repay the entire amount of the default to the State with interest compounded annually at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate before water deliveries that had been suspended shall be fully resumed to that contractor. If the defaulting contractor makes a partial repayment of its default, the Department may provide a proportional restoration of suspended deliveries. The amount of the default to be repaid shall include any amounts previously received by the State from insurance proceeds, bond debt service coverage, or other reserves, and payments from other contractors pursuant to this subparagraph (h). The defaulting contractor shall not be entitled to any make-up water deliveries as
compensation for any water deliveries suspended during the period when the contractor was in default.

(5) At such time as the default amount is repaid by the defaulting contractor, the non-defaulting contractors shall receive credits in proportion to their contributions towards the amount of the default with interest collected by the State on the defaulted amount.

(6) In the event there is an increase in the amount a non-defaulting contractor contributes to reserves and/or bond debt service coverage, such increase shall be handled in the same manner as provided in Article 50(a).

(T) Action taken pursuant to this subarticle shall not deprive the State of or limit any remedy provided by this contract or by law for the recovery of money due or which may become due under this contract.

119

Article 50(i)

(i) [Inoperative] Power of Termination. <Attachments N and 0>

(1) The Department and the Agency <District> agree to negotiate in good faith the development of a means to provide adequate protection for the Department's cash flow into priorities one and two for revenues under Water Code Section 12937(b) with the goal of obtaining agreement by April 1, 1987. The Department and the Agency <District> agree to continue negotiations beyond April 1, 1987 if necessary to meet their common goal of arriving at agreement.

(2) If such an agreement has not been reached by April 1, 1987, and if the Director of Water Resources determines that adequate progress has not been
made toward such an agreement, the Director may give notice to the Agency <District> and other contractors that he intends to exercise the power to terminate provided in this subarticle 50(i). The Director's authority to give such a notice shall terminate on July 1, 1988.

(3) After six months from the date of issuing the notice of intent to terminate, but in no event later than January 1, 1989, the Director may terminate the authority of the Department to issue additional series of water system revenue bonds using the repayment provisions of Article 50. The Department shall promptly notify the Agency <District> and other contractors that the Director has exercised the power of termination.

(4) No additional series of water system revenue bonds shall be issued under the provisions of this Article 50 after the Director has exercised the power to terminate, but Article 50 shall remain in effect as to any series of water system revenue bonds issued prior to the time the Director exercises the power to
terminate.

(5) An exercise of the power to terminate provided in this subarticle 50(i) shall also rescind any changes made by this amendment in the schedule of payment of overpayment or underpayment of capital costs resulting from a change in the project interest rate and shall also rescind the addition of item (7) to Article 1(t). However, if the Department has borrowed any funds under Article 1(t)(7), Article 1(t)(7) shall remain in effect as to that and only that borrowing. Upon the exercising of the power to terminate, subarticles 28(e) and (f) shall be rescinded and Article 1(t) shall read as it previously read as shown on Attachment Number to this amendment. <See Attachment M>

120

Articles 50(i), 50(j), 51(a)

(6) At any time before January 1, 1989, so long as the Director has not already exercised the power of termination, the Director may irrevocably waive his right to exercise the power of termination or may rescind any previously issued notice of intention to terminate. <See Attachment N>

(7) If the Director does not exercise the power of termination before January 1, 1989, this subarticle 50(i) shall expire, and the remainder of this Article 50 shall remain in effect. Changes made by this amendment to other articles shall also remain in effect.

71 (i) Amounts payable under this article shall not be affected by any reductions in
payments pursuant to Article 51.

72 51. Financial Adjustments.

(a) General Operating Account.

(1) The State shall maintain a General Operating Account to provide the moneys needed to pay obligations incurred by the State of the types described in Water Code sections 12937(b)(1) and (2) in the event of emergency or cash flow shortages.

(2) An initial deposit of $15 million shall be made available from revenue bond reserves that are no longer required by revenue bond covenants and that would otherwise be credited to the contractors including the District. In 1998 or when the funds become available an additional $7.7 million will be deposited in the General Operating Account from revenue bond reserves that are no longer required by revenue bond covenants and that would otherwise be credited to the contractors including the District, bringing the deposits to that account under this article to $22.7 million.

(3) The balance in the General Operating Account will increase pursuant to subdivision (e)(3)(v) of this article to an amount determined by the State but not in excess of $32 million. However, after the year 2001, the maximum amount of the fund may increase or decrease annually by not more than the same percentage as the increase or decrease in the charges, other than power charges for pumping water, to all the contractors for the previous year from the charges for the year before that for obligations under subdivisions (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this article.

71 Added: Amendment 25 72 Added: Amendment 25

121

Articles 51(b), 51(c)

(b) State Water Facilities Capital Account.

(1) The State shall establish a State Water Facilities Capital Account to be funded from revenues available under Water Code section 12937(b)(4). Through procedures described in this article and as limited by this article, the State may consider as a revenue need under subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article and may
deposit in the State Water Facilities Capital Account the amounts necessary to pay capital costs of the State Water Facilities for which neither general obligation bond
nor revenue bond proceeds are available, including but not limited to planning, reconnaissance and feasibility studies, the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program and, through the year 2000, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.

(2) The Director of the Department of Water Resources shall fully consult with the contractors and consider any advice given prior to depositing funds into this account for any purposes. Deposits into this account shall not exceed the amounts specified in subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article plus any amounts determined pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(ii) of this article.

(3) The State shall use revenue bonds or other sources of moneys rather
than this account to finance the costs of construction of any major capital projects.

(c) Calculation of Financial Needs.

(1) Each year the State shall calculate in accordance with the timing provisions of Articles 29 and 31 the amounts that would have been charged (but for this article) to cach contractor as provided in other provisions of this contract.

(2) Each year the State shall also establish its revenue needs for the following year for the following purposes, subject to the following limitations:

(i) The amount required to be collected under the provisions of this contract, other than this article, with respect to all revenue bonds issued by the State for Project Facilities.

(ii) The amount required for payment of the reasonable costs of the annual maintenance and operation of the State Water Resources Development System and the replacement of any parts thereof as described in Water Code section 12937(b)(1). These costs shall not include operation and maintenance costs of any Federal Central Valley Project facilities constructed by the United States and acquired by the State of California after 1994, other than the State's share of the joint use facilities which include San Luis Reservoir, the San Luis Canal and related facilities.

122

Article 51(c)

(iii) The amount required for payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to the Burns-Porter Act as described in Water Code section 12937(b)(2).

(iv) Any amount required for transfer to the California Water Fund in reimbursement as described in Water Code section 12937(b)(3) for funds utilized from said fund for construction of the State Water Resources
Development System.

(v) For the years 1998 and thereafter, the amount needed for
deposits into the State Water Facilities Capital Account as provided in subdivision (b) of this article, but (A) not more than $6 million per year for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, and (B) not more than $4.5 million per year for the years 2001 and thereafter.

(3) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (e) of this article, the State shall reduce the annual charges in the aggregate for all contractors by the amounts by which the hypothetical charges calculated pursuant to subdivision (c)(1) above exceed the revenue needs determined pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) above. The reductions under this article shall be apportioned among the contractors as provided in subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this article. Reductions to contractors shall be used to reduce the payments due from the contractors on each January 1 and July 1; provided, however, that to the extent required pursuant to subdivision (h) of this article, each Agricultural Contractor shall pay to the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund an amount equal to the reduction allocated to such Agricultural Contractor. Any default in payment to the trust fund shall be subject to the same remedies as any default in payment to the State under this contract.

(4) The State may submit supplemental billing to the District for the year in an amount not to exceed the amount of the prior reductions for such year under this article if necessary to meet unanticipated costs for purposes identified in Water Code section 12937(b)(1) and (2) for which the State can issue billings under other provisions of this contract. Any supplemental billing made to the District for
these purposes shall be in the same proportion to the total supplemental billings to all contractors for these purposes as the prior reduction in charges to the District in that year bears to the total reductions in charges to all contractors in that year and shall be treated as reducing the amount of the reduction made available for that year to the District by the amount of the supplemental bill to the District.

(5) The State may also submit a supplemental billing to the District for the year if necessary to meet unanticipated costs for revenue bond debt service and coverage for which the State can issue a statement of charges under provisions of this contract other than this article. The relative amounts of any supplemental billing made to the District and to other contractors for revenue bond purposes shall be governed by such other applicable provisions of this contract.

123

Articles 51(c), 51(d)

(6) Payment of any supplemental billing shall be due thirty days after the date of the invoice. Delinquency and interest on delinquent amounts due shall be governed by Article 32.

(d) Apportionment of Reductions between Agricultural and Urban Contractors.

(1) Reductions available under this article are projected to begin to occur in 1997. The numbers and percentages in this subdivision reflect certain estimates of dollars and sharing of reductions. The actual reductions may vary slightly from the amounts described below. The State shall determine the availability of
reductions for each year in accordance with this article.

(2) Reductions shall be phased in as follows:

(i) In 1997 reductions in the amount of $14 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

(ii) In 1998 reductions in the amount of $17 million are projected
to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

(iii) In 1999 reductions in the amount of $32 million are projected
to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.

(iv) In 2000 reductions in the amount of $33 million are projected
to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
(3)(i) In the event that the aggregate amount of reductions in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is less than the respective amount projected for such year in subdivision (d)(2) above, the shortfall shall be taken first from reductions that would have been provided to Urban Contractors. Only after all reductions to Urban Contractors have been eliminated in a given year shall the remaining shortfall be taken from reductions scheduled for Agricultural Contractors. Any projected reductions not made available due to such shortfalls in the years 1997 through 2000 shall be deferred with

124

Articles 51(d), 51(e)

interest at the project interest rate to the earliest subsequent years when reductions in excess of those projected for those years are available. Such deferred reductions with interest at the project interest rate shall be applied to the charges of the contractors whose reductions have been deferred.

(ii) In the event that the aggregate amount of reductions available in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is greater than the sum of (A) the respective amount projected for such year in subdivision (d)(2) above, plus
(B) the amount of any shortfall with accrued interest at the project interest rate, remaining from any prior year to be applied, the excess shall be applied for the purposes and in the amounts per year described in subdivisions
(e)(3)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this article, in that order.

(4) In 2001 and in each succeeding year reductions equal to or in excess of $40.5 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows:

(i) If reductions are available in an amount that equals or
exceeds $40.5 million, $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and $30.5 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors. If reductions are available in an amount greater than $40.5 million, the excess shall be applied as provided in subdivision (e)(3) of this article, subject however to subdivision (e)(1).

(ii) If reductions are available in an amount less than $40.5
million in any of these years, the reductions shall be divided on a 24.7% - 75.3% basis between the Agricultural Contractors and the Urban Contractors respectively. Any such reductions not made due to shortages shall be applied without interest in the next year in which reductions in an amount in
excess of $40.5 million are available pursuant to subdivision (e)(3) of this article with any remainder that is not available carried over without interest
to be applied in the earliest subsequent years when reductions in excess of
$40.5 million are available.

(5) Annual charges to a contractor shall only be reduced prospectively
from and after the date it executes the Monterey Amendment to this contract. Apportionments of reductions shall be calculated on the assumption that all contractors have executed such amendment.

(e) Review of Financial Requirements.

(1) In 2001 and every fifth year thereafter the Director of the Department of Water Resources, in full consultation with the contractors, will review the financial requirements of the State Water Resources Development System and
determine the following:

125

Article 51(e)

(i) The amount of revenues that are needed for State Water
Resources Development System purposes in addition to those needed for the purposes specified in subdivisions (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this article;

(ii) If the aggregate amount that would have been charged to all contractors in any year but for this article exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of revenues needed for the purposes specified in subdivisions (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), plus (B) $40.5 million, plus (C) the amount determined pursuant to subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article, the amount of such excess.

(iti) The amount of the excess determined in subdivision (e)(1)(ii) above that should be collected by the State for additional State Water Resources Development System purposes and the amount of such excess that should be used for further annual charge reductions.

(2) After making the determinations required above, the State may collect the revenues for additional State Water Resources Development System purposes in the amount determined pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(iii) above.

(3) If and to the extent that as a result of such determinations, the
aggregate amount to be charged to contractors is to be reduced by more than $40.5 million per year, the following priorities and limitations shall apply with respect to the application of such additional reductions:

(i) First, reductions shall be allocated to make up shortfalls in reductions from those projected for the years 1997 through 2000 with
interest at the project interest rate pursuant to subdivision (d)(3)(i).

(ii) Second, reductions shall be allocated to make up shortfalls in
reductions from those projected for the years beginning with 2001 without
interest pursuant to subdivision (d)(4)(ii).

(iii) Third, additional reductions in the amount of $2 million per year shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors until a total of $19.3 million in such additional reductions have been so applied.

(iv) Fourth, reductions up to an additional $2 million per year shall be allocated to make up any shortfalls in the annual reductions provided for in subdivision (e)(3)(iii).

126

Articles 51(e), 51(f)

(v) Fifth, $2 million per year shall be charged and collected by the State and deposited in the General Operating Account to bring the
account ultimately up to an amount determined by the State but not in excess
of $32 million with adjustments as provided in subdivision (a) of this article.
Any amount in the account in excess of this requirement shall be returned to
general project revenues.

(vi) Sixth, remaining amounts if any shall be used for reductions divided on 24.7% - 75.3% basis between the Agricultural Contractors and
the Urban Contractors respectively.

(f) Apportionment of Reductions Among Urban Contractors.

Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Urban Contractors under subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be further allocated among Urban Contractors pursuant to this subdivision. The amount of reduction of annual charges for each Urban Contractor shall be based on each Urban Contractor's proportionate share of total allocated capital costs as calculated below, for both project conservation and project transportation facilities, repaid by all Urban Contractors over the project repayment period.

(1) The conservation capital cost component of the reduction allocation shall be apportioned on the basis of maximum annual entitlement. Each Urban
Contractor's proportionate share shall be the same as the percentage of that
contractor's maximum annual entitlement to the total of all Urban Contractors'
maximum annual entitlements.

(2) The transportation capital cost component of the reduction allocation
shall be apportioned on the basis of transportation capital cost component repayment
obligations, including interest over the project repayment period. Each Urban Contractor's proportionate share shall be the same as the percentage that the contractor's total transportation capital cost component repayment obligation is of
the total of all Urban Contractors' transportation capital cost component repayment
obligations.

(i) Recalculations shall be made annually through the year 1999. Beginning in the year 2000 recalculations shall be made every five years unless an Urban Contractor requests a recalculation for an interim year and
does so by a request in writing delivered to the Department by January of
the year in which the recalculation is to take place.

127

Article 51(f)

(ii) The transportation capital cost component repayment obligations, for purposes of this Article 51(f), shall be based in the year of recalculation on the then most recent Department of Water Resources Bulletin 132, Table B-15, "Capital Cost Component of Transportation Charge for Each Contractor," or its equivalent, excluding any costs or entitlement associated with transfers of entitlement from Agricultural
Contractors pursuant to Article 53.

(3) To reflect the relative proportion of the conservation capital cost component and the transportation capital cost component to the total of all capital cost repayment obligations, the two cost components shall be weighted as follows:

(1) The conservation capital cost component shall be weighted with a thirty percent (30%) factor. The weighting shall be accomplished by multiplying each Urban Contractor's percentage of maximum annual entitlements as calculated in subdivision (f)(1) of this article by thirty
percent (30%).

(ii) The transportation capital cost component shall be weighted
with a seventy percent (70%) factor. The weighting shall be accomplished by multiplying each Urban Contractor's percentage of transportation capital cost component repayment obligations as calculated in subdivision (f)(2) of this article by seventy percent (70%).

(iii) A total, weighted capital cost percentage shall be calculated for each Urban Contractor by adding the weighted conservation capital cost component percentage to their weighted transportation capital cost
component percentage.

(4) The total amount of the annual charges to be reduced to Urban Contractors in each year shall be allocated among them by multiplying the total amount of annual charges to be reduced to the Urban Contractors by the total,
weighted capital cost percentages for each such contractor. If the amount of the
reduction to an Urban Contractor is in excess of that contractor's payment obligation
to the Department for that year, such excess shall be reallocated among the other
Urban Contractors.

128

Articles 51(f), 51(g)

(5) In the case of a permanent transfer of urban entitlement, the proportionate share of annual charge reductions associated with that entitlement shall be transferred with the entitlement to the buying contractor. In the case of an entitlement transfer by either Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District or San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, the reductions in annual charges to that agency shall be allocated (a) on the basis of that entitlement being retained by that agency which bears Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs, (b) on the basis of that entitlement being retained by that agency which does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs, and (c) on the basis of the balance of that agency's entitlement which also does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs.

(g) Apportionment of Reductions Among Agricultural Contractors.

(1) Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Agricultural Contractors under subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be allocated among the Agricultural Contractors pursuant to this subdivision. The amount of reduction of
annual charges for each Agricultural Contractor for the years 1997 through 2001 shall be based on each Agricultural Contractor's estimated proportionate share of the total project costs, excluding the variable operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Delta Water Charge and the Transportation Charge and also excluding off-aqueduct power charges, to be paid by all Agricultural Contractors for the years 1997 through 2035, calculated without taking into account this article. For purposes of these calculations, Kern County Water Agency and Dudley Ridge Water District's estimated project costs shall not include any costs associated with the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement being relinquished by those contractors pursuant to subdivision (j) of Article 53. Also, for purposes of these calculations, an Agricultural Contractor's estimated project costs shall not be reduced by the transfer of any of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in subdivisions (a) through (i) of Article 53. The proportionate shares for 1997 through 2001 shall be calculated as follows:

(i) Each Agricultural Contractor's statement of charges received on July 1, 1994, shall be the initial basis for calculating the proportionate shares for the five years 1997 through 2001.

(ii) Each Agricultural Contractor's estimated capital and minimum components of the Delta Water Charge and the Transportation Charge (excluding off-aqueduct power charges) and Water Revenue Bond Surcharge shall be totaled for the years 1997 through 2035.

(iii) Kern County Water Agency and Dudley Ridge Water District totaled costs shall be reduced for the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement being relinquished by them.

129

Articles 51(g), 51(h)

(iv) Any reductions in an Agricultural Contractor's totaled costs resulting from the transfer of any of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement shall be re-added to that contractor's costs.

(v) Each Agricultural Contractor's proportionate share shall be computed by dividing that contractor's total costs by the total costs for all Agricultural Contractors determined pursuant to subparagraphs (ii), (iii)
and (iv) above.

(2) The reductions in annual charges, for 1997 through 2001, shall be calculated using the method described in subdivision (g)(1) of this article.

(3) The allocation shall be recalculated using the same method described in subdivision (g)(1) of this article every five years beginning in 2002, if any Agricultural Contractor requests such a recalculation. Any recalculation shall be based on project cost data beginning with the year that the recalculation is to become effective through 2035.

(h) Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund.

(1) Establishment. Through a trust agreement executed contemporaneously with this amendment, the State and the Agricultural Contractors that sign the Monterey Amendments shall establish the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund with a mutually agreed independent trustee.

(2) Separate Accounts. The trustee shall maintain within the trust fund a separate account for each Agricultural Contractor that signs the trust agreement to hold deposits made pursuant to this article.

(3) Deposits. Each Agricultural Contractor that signs the trust agreement shall deposit into such contractor's account within the trust fund, at the same time as payments would otherwise be required by this contract to be made to the State, an amount equal to the amount by which such contractor's charges under this contract have been reduced by reason of this article, until the balance in such contractor's account within the trust fund is the same percentage of $150,000,000 as such contractor's percentage share of reductions made available to all Agricultural Contractors as specified in subdivision (g) of this article. In 2002 and every fifth year thereafter, the Agricultural Contractors will review the maximum accumulation in the trust fund (the "Cap") and determine whether the cap should be adjusted. However, the Cap shall not be reduced below an aggregate of $150,000,000 for all Agricultural Contractor accounts.

130

Article 51(h)

(4) Trust Fund Disbursements.

(i) In any year in which the State's allocation of water to an
Agricultural Contractor by April 15th of that year is less than one hundred
percent (100%) of the contractor's requested annual entitlement for that year, the trustee shall, to the extent there are funds in that contractor's account, distribute to the State from such account for the benefit of that contractor an
amount equal to the percentage of the total of that contractor's statement of charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on or about May 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b) the capital cost and minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charge (including off-aqueduct power charges); and (c) the water system revenue bond surcharge, that is equal to the percentage of that contractor's annual entitlement for that year that was not allocated to it by the State by April 15th of that year.

(ii) In addition to the provisions of subdivision (h)(4)(i) of this article, if on April 15 of any year any of the irrigable land within the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District (Tulare) is flooded, and Tulare in writing requests the trustee to do so, the trustee shall, to the extent there are funds in Tulare's account, distribute to the State from such account for the benefit of
Tulare an amount equal to the percentage of the total of Tulare's statement of
charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on or about May 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b) the capital cost and minimum components of the Transportation Charge (including off-aqueduct power
charges); and (c) the water system revenue bond surcharge, that is equal to the percentage of the irrigable land within Tulare that is flooded on April 15.

(iii) Each Agricultural Contractor shall remain obligated to make payments to the State as required by other articles in this contract. Any amount to be disbursed pursuant to subdivisions (h)(4)(i) and (h)(4)(ii) shall be paid by the trustee to the State on July of the year involved and shall be credited by the State toward any amounts owed by such respective Agricultural Contractor to the State as of that date. However, an
Agricultural Contractor may direct the trustee to make the disbursement to that Agricultural Contractor which shall in turn make the payment to the State as required by other provisions of this contract. If the amount to be disbursed exceeds the amount owed to the State by such contractor as of
July 1, the excess shall be disbursed by the Trustee to the State at the time of and in payment of future obligations owed to the State by such contractor.
Alternatively, upon the request of such contractor, all or part of the excess shall be paid by the trustee to that contractor in reimbursement of prior payments by the contractor to the State for that year.

131

Articles 51(h), 51(i)

(5) Payment of Supplemental Bills. In any year in which a supplemental
bill has been submitted to an Agricultural Contractor pursuant to subdivision (c)(4)
of this article, such supplemental bill shall be treated as reducing by an equal amount the obligation of such contractor for that year to make payments into the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund. To the extent that such contractor has already made payments to the trust fund in an amount in excess of such contractor's reduced trust fund payment obligation, such contractor may request the trustee to use the excess from the trust fund to pay the supplemental bill.

(6) Discharge of Payment Obligation. Each payment to the State by the
trust fund shall discharge and satisfy the Agricultural Contractor's obligation to pay the amount of such payment to the State. No reimbursement of the trust fund by the Agricultural Contractor for such payments shall be required. However, each Agricultural Contractor shall continue to make deposits to the trust fund matching the amount of each year's reductions as provided in subdivision (d) of this article so long as the amount in that contractor's account is less than its share of the Cap.

(7) Distribution of Funds in Excess of the Cap. Whenever accumulated
funds (including interest) in an Agricultural Contractor's account in the trust fund exceed that contractor's share of the Cap, or the estimated remaining payments the contractor is required to make to the State prior to the end of the project repayment period, that contractor may direct the trustee to pay such excess to the contractor.

(8) Termination of Trust Fund. At the end of the project repayment
period, the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund shall be terminated and any balances remaining in the accounts for each of the Agricultural Contractors shall be disbursed to the respective Agricultural Contractors.

(i) Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following definitions will
apply:

(1) "Agricultural Contractor" shail mean the following agencies as they
now exist or in any reorganized form:

74 53. Permanent Transfers and Reductions of Entitlement.

(a) Article 41 provides that no assignment or transfer of a contract or any part thereof, rights thereunder or interest therein by a contractor shall be valid unless and until it is approved by the State and made subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the In accordance with State policy to assist water transfers, the State and State may impose. the County of Kings, Dudley Ridge Water District (DRWD), Empire West Side Irrigation District, Kern County Water Agency (KCWA), Oak Flat Water District and Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District (for the purposes of this article the "Agricultural Contractors") shall, subject to the conditions set forth in this article, expeditiously execute any necessary documents and approve all contracts between willing buyers and willing sellers until permanent transfers totaling 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements of the Agricultural Contractors and, to the extent provided in such contracts, rights in project transportation facilities related to such annual entitlement have been made to other contractors (the "Urban Contractors") or noncontractors in accordance with the provisions of this article. Such approval requirement shall apply to all contracts executed prior to January 1, 2011. KCWA shall be responsible for approval of such transfers for any portion of the 130,000 acre-feet not previously made available under this article by the other Agricultural Contractors. A contract between a willing buyer and a willing seller shall mean a contract between (1) a buyer which is an Urban Contractor or, to the extent provided in subdivision (e) of this article, a noncontractor and (2) a seller which a is an Agricultural Contractor or a public entity which obtains project water from an Agricultural Contractor.

(b) The State shall not be obligated to approve any transfer of annual entitlements if in its judgment the transfer would impair the security of the State's bondholders and the State may impose conditions on any transfer as necessary to make the delivery of the water operationally feasible and to assure that the transportation costs associated with the transferred entitlement are fully repaid.

Any such sales to KCWA member units exercising such right of first refusal shall not be considered a part of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in this article.

74 Added: Amendment 25

134

Article 53(d)

(d) Any permanent transfers of annual entitlements by Agricultural Contractors to noncontractors, including transfers to KCWA urban member units or to KCWA's Improvement District Number 4, other than transfers pursuant to subdivision (c) of this article, will be considered a part of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in this article if the Urban Contractors have been given a right of first refusal to purchase such annual entitlements as well as transportation rights in accordance with the following terms and procedure:

(1) The Agricultural Contractor shall provide the State a copy of a bona fide contract or Proposed Contract (the "Proposed Contract") and the State shall, within five working days of receipt, provide copies of such Proposed Contract to all Urban Contractors together with a Notice of Proposed Contract stating the date on or before which a Notice of Intent to Exercise a Right of First Refusal (NOI) must be delivered to both the State and the seller, which date shall be 90 days from the date the State mails the Notice of Proposed Contract.

(2) The Proposed Contract shall provide for the transfer of rights in project transportation facilities sufficient to deliver to the seller's service area in any one month eleven percent (11%) of the annual entitlement being transferred or such greater amount as the seller determines to sell; provided, however, that sellers shall not be obligated to sell any transportation rights in the Coastal Aqueduct.

(3) To exercise the right of first refusal, an Urban Contractor shall deliver to the State and the seller its NOI within the time period stated in the Notice of Proposed Contract and shall proceed in good faith to try to complete the transfer to the Urban Contractor. If two or more Urban Contractors deliver NOI's to the State, the amount of annual entitlement and transportation rights being sold shall be allocated among those Urban Contractors that are prepared to perform the purchase by the Performance Date provided for herein in proportion to their maximum annual entitlements, or in another manner acceptable to the Urban Contractors delivering the NOIs. An offer by an Urban Contractor in its NOI to purchase less than the entire annual entitlement and transportation right being transferred shall not be deemed to be an effective exercise of the right of first refusal unless other Urban Contractors submit NOIs to purchase the remainder of the annual entitlement and transportation right or the noncontractor buyer agrees to purchase the remainder at the same unit price and on the same terms and conditions provided for in the Proposed Contract. The Performance Date shall be the date upon which the Urban Contractor is prepared to perform the purchase, which date shall be the later of: (1) 180 days after the delivery of the NOI or (2) the date set forth in the Proposed Contract for the noncontractor buyer to perform the purchase.

135

Articles 53(d), 53(e), 53(f)

The Performance Date shall be extended at the request of the Urban Contractor if a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is in effect as a result of a lawsuit challenging the execution of the contract on the basis of noncompliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. Such extensions shall continue until five days after the temporary restraining order or injunction expires or until the Urban Contractor requests it be discontinued, whichever occurs first. The Urban Contractor shall be liable for any damages suffered by the seller as a result of such extensions of the Performance Date.

(4) If the seller and the noncontractor buyer under the Proposed Contract make any substantive changes in the Proposed Contract, such changes shall constitute a new Proposed Contract that cannot be performed without compliance with all of the procedures set forth in this article.

(5) If an Urban Contractor issuing a NOI fails to complete its exercise of the Right of First Refusal by the Performance Date, the seller shall be free to sell its entitlement in substantial conformance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Contract. An Urban Contractor issuing a NOI may assign its rights to exercise a right of first refusal to another Urban Contractor and the assignee shall have the same rights as the assignor to complete the purchase by the Performance
Date.

(6) In exercising the Right of First Refusal, an Urban Contractor, at its option, may either agree to perform the Proposed Contract in its entirety, including all of its terms and conditions, or agree to pay the price offered under the Proposed Contract for the annual entitlement and transportation rights without condition and without being entitled to enforce or being subject to any other provisions of the
Proposed Contract.

(e) As used in this article, "price" shall mean the dollar amount of consideration
provided for in the Proposed Contract.

(f) Upon the effective date of any such transfer, the seller shall be relieved of and the buyer shall become liable to the State for all prospective Delta Water Charges, the related Transportation Charges and any other charges for the annual entitlements and
associated transportation rights transferred unless the seller and buyer provide otherwise in the contract for the transfer and the State approves such other provisions. However, the contractor making the sale shall remain obligated to the State to make the payments if the buyer defaults on its payments to the State related to the water transferred and is not a party to a long term water supply contract of the type contained in Department of Water

136

Articles 53(f), 53(g), 53(h)

Resources Bulletin Number 141. If the contractor making the sale is required to make any payments to the State as a result of the buyer's default, the entitlement transferred to the defaulting buyer shall, if provided for in the Proposed Contract, revert back to the contractor making the sale. The buyer may also be liable for any charges imposed pursuant to subdivision (g) of this article.

(g) A contractor which is a buyer of annual entitlement pursuant to this article may receive deliveries using any portion of the capacity previously provided by the State in each reach of the project transportation facilities for such contractor that is necessary for transporting the entitlement purchased by it on the same basis as any other entitlement provided for in its Table A in effect prior to the date of the Monterey Amendment. Such contractor may also use any transportation rights transferred to it by a seller in the same manner as the seller was entitled to use them and any unused capacity in any of the reaches specified in this paragraph so long as project operations and/or priority of service of water to other contractors participating in repayment of capital costs in such reaches is not adversely affected. The State shall not be responsible for any resulting adverse impacts upon its ability to provide such contractor peaking capacity. The capital cost and minimum, operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charge allocated to a buying contractor needing transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors on which its charges are based in any reach shall be determined prospectively based upon the increase in the buying contractor's annual entitlement resulting from the purchase, and service of water to fulfill annual entitlement to other contractors shall not be impaired. The capital cost and minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charges shall then be reallocated among the other entities participating in repayment of costs of that reach. For the purposes of this determination, all payments received by the State from the seller relating to the annual entitlement sold shall be deemed
to have been received from the buying contractor. Any increased Transportation minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement component charges allocated to the buying contractor pursuant to this subdivision (g) shall begin January 1 of the year following the effective date of the transfer.

(h) Individual contractors may transfer entitlements among themselves in amounts in addition to those otherwise provided for in this article. The State shall expeditiously execute any necessary documents and approve all contracts involving permanent sales of entitlements among contractors, including permanent sales among Urban Contractors. Such sales shall be subject to the provisions of subdivisions (b), (f) and (g) of this article; Provided, however, that for a buying contractor needing transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors on which its charges are based in any reach, reallocation of the Transportation capital cost component charges for transfers other than (i) the 130,000 acre-feet provided for in this article and (ii) the approximate 33,000 acre-feet of transfers proposed from contractors located in Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo counties, shall be determined both prospectively and retroactively.

137

Articles 53(i), 54(a)

(i) On January 1 following the year in which such Monterey Amendments become effective and continuing every year thereafter until the end of the project repayment period: (i) Kern County Water Agency's (KCWA) annual entitlement for agricultural use as currently designated in Table A-1 of its contract shall be decreased by 40,670 acre-feet; (ii) Dudley Ridge Water District's (DRWD) annual entitlement as currently designated in Table A of its contract shall be decreased by 4,330 acre-feet; and (iii) the State's prospective charges (including any adjustments for past costs) for the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements to be relinquished by KCWA and DRWD thereafter shall be deemed to be costs of project conservation facilities and included in the Delta Water Charge for all contractors in accordance with the provisions of Article 22. If by November 20, 1995 and each October thereafter until the Monterey Amendments of both KCWA and DRWD
become effective, KCWA and DRWD at their option notify the State in writing that they will relinquish up to their shares of 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements for the following calendar year beginning before the effective date of the Monterey Amendments, the State shall adjust the charges retroactively for the acre-feet relinquished by KCWA and DRWD to January 1 of each year for which water was relinquished. The delivery points for the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement to be relinquished shall be identified for the State by KCWA and DRWD to enable the State to calculate the transportation costs for the 45,000 acre-feet to be included in the Delta Water Charge.
75 54. Usage of Lakes Castaic and Perris.

(a) The State shall permit the contractors participating in repayment of the capital costs of Castaic Lake (Reach 30) and Lake Perris (Reach 28J) to withdraw water from their respective service connections in amounts in excess of deliveries approved pursuant to other provisions of the state water contracts. Each such contractor shall be permitted to withdraw up to a Maximum Allocation from the reach in which it is participating. The contractors participating in repayment of Castaic Lake may withdraw a collective Maximum Allocation up to 160,000 acre-feet pursuant to this article, which shall be apportioned among them pursuant to the respective proportionate use factors from the Department of Water Resources' Bulletin 132-94, Table B-1 upon which capital cost repayment obligations are based, as follows:

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, as the only contractor participating in repayment of Lake Perris, shall be allocated a Maximum Allocation at
Lake Perris of 65,000 acre-feet based upon a proportionate use factor of 1.00000000.
The Maximum Allocation totals of 160,000 acre-feet and 65,000 acre-feet shall not be subject to adjustment. The individual contractor's Maximum Allocations shall be adjusted only as agreed to among the contractors desiring to adjust their Maximum Allocations. Adjustments between the contractors shall be subject to approval of the State which approval shall be given unless there are adverse impacts upon another contractor participating in the reach which are unacceptable to such contractor. The participating contractors will, in consultation with the State, cooperate with each other in an effort to promote efficient utilization of Castaic Lake, and to minimize any adverse impacts to each other, through coordination of deliveries pursuant to other provisions of the State Water Contract as well as withdrawals of allocations pursuant to this article.

(b) The State shall operate Castaic and Perris Reservoirs as transportation facilities in a manner consistent with this article. A contractor desiring to withdraw a portion or all of its Maximum Allocation shall furnish the State with a proposed delivery schedule. The proposed schedule may be submitted as part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1). Upon receipt of a schedule the State shall promptly review it to ensure that the amounts, times and rates of delivery will be consistent with the State's ability to operate the reach. The contractor may modify its proposed delivery schedule at any time, and the modified schedule shall be subject to review in the same manner. If necessary, the State may modify the schedule after

139

Articles 54(b), 54(c)

consultation with the contractor and other contractors participating in repayment of that reach but may not change the total quantity of water to be withdrawn. As part of the consultation, the State shall advise a contractor if it determines a withdrawal will adversely impact the rate of delivery provided for the contractor in this contract. The State shall not be responsible for any such impacts.

(c) A contractor may withdraw all or a portion of its Maximum Allocation. It shall restore any withdrawn portion of such allocation by furnishing an equivalent amount of replacement water to the reservoir from which the water was withdrawn within five years from the year in which the withdrawal takes place. The unused portion of the allocation, in addition to any replacement water furnished to the reservoir, shall remain available for subsequent withdrawal. The State shall keep an accounting of the contractor's storage withdrawals and replacements. In any year, the State shall permit a contractor to withdraw an amount equivalent to the contractor's Maximum Allocation minus remaining replacement water requirements due to previous withdrawals. If the contractor fails to schedule and replace the withdrawn water within the five-year return period, the State shall provide the replacement water from water scheduled for delivery to the contractor in the sixth year or as soon as possible thereafter. The total amount of scheduled annual entitlement which a contractor can use a in any one year for restoring its Maximum Allocation and storing water in surface storage facilities outside of its service area pursuant to Article 56 shall be the sum of the maximum amount the contractor can
add to storage that year pursuant to Article 56 and the amount of acre-feet shown in column 2 of the following table, depending on the State's final water supply allocation percentage as shown in column 1.

141

Articles 54(c), 54(d), 54(e), 54(f), 54(g)

A contractor may use any of this total amount for replacement water but cannot use any more than that provided for in Article 56 to add to storage in project surface conservation facilities and in nonproject surface storage facilities. There shall be no limit under this article on the amount of scheduled annual entitlement a contractor can use to
restore its Maximum Allocation in a year when its percentage of annual water supply
allocation is one hundred percent (100%), nor shall there be any limit under this article on
the amount of interruptible water, nonproject water or water obtained through an exchange which a contractor can use to restore its Maximum Allocation.

(d) For any replacement water furnished to reservoir storage pursuant to this article, the responsible contractor shall pay the State charges for the conservation, if any, and transportation of such replacement water as are associated with the type of replacement water that is furnished, as if such water were delivered to the turnout at the reservoir to which the replacement water is furnished. Adjustments from estimated to actual costs shall be subject to provisions applicable to the type of replacement water. The State shall not charge contractors for water withdrawn pursuant to this article.

(e) The State shall operate capacity in Castaic and Perris Reservoirs, not required for purposes of Maximum Allocation deliveries, in compliance with the requirement of Article 17(b) of The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's water supply contract with the State to maintain an amount of water reasonably sufficient to meet emergency requirements of the contractors participating in repayment of that reach. A contractor receiving water pursuant to this article accepts that the State shall not be liable for any damage, direct or indirect, arising from shortages in the amount of water to be made available from that reservoir to meet the contractor's actual emergency requirements as a result of prior storage withdrawals by that contractor pursuant to this article. Nothing in this article shall permit or require the State to adjust allocations or deliveries under Article 18.

(f) To the extent a contractor, during a calendar year, uses all or a portion of its Maximum Allocation, the State may, to the extent necessary to service project purposes, reduce that contractor's requested peaking service. Such reduction in peaking service shall only occur to the extent such usage of Maximum Allocation causes the State to be unable to provide all peaking service requested. This paragraph shall not apply to the extent the contractor requested usage of Maximum Allocation as part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1).

(g) The State may reduce water stored in Castaic Lake and Lake Perris to the extent necessary for maintenance and to respond to emergencies resulting from failure of project transportation facilities or of other supply importation facilities serving the State project service area. The State shall promptly replace water within the Maximum Allocation as soon as the need for the reduction terminates.

Articles 55(a), 55(b), 55(c), 56(a)

76 55. Transportation of Nonproject Water.

(a) Subject to the delivery priorities in Article 12(f), contractors shall have the right to receive services from any of the project transportation facilities to transport water
procured by them from nonproject sources for delivery to their service areas and to interim storage outside their service areas for later transport and delivery to their service areas: Provided, that except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the Water Code be changed, a contractor shall not use the project transportation facilities under this option to transport water the right to which was secured by the contractor through eminent domain unless such use be approved by the Legislature by concurrent resolution with the majority of the members elected to each house voting in favor thereof.

(b) For any nonproject water delivered pursuant to this article, contractors shall pay the State the same (including adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the conservation and transportation of such water as if such nonproject water were entitlement water, as well as all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, which may include an administrative or contract preparation charge, all as determined by the State. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower costs which would not be incurred if nonproject water were not scheduled for or delivered to
contractors. Only those contractors not participating in the repayment of a reach shall be
required to pay a use of facilities charge for the delivery of nonproject water from or through that reach. Costs for transporting water placed into interim storage shall be paid in the same manner provided for in subdivision (c)(6) of Article 56.

(c) The amounts, times and rates of delivery of nonproject water shall be provided for pursuant to a water delivery schedule to be issued in the same manner as provided for in Article 12. The costs specified in this article shall be paid for at the same time the corresponding project water costs are paid.

77 56. Use, Storage and Sale of Project Water Outside of Service Area and Storage of
Water in Project Surface Conservation Facilities.

(a) State Consent to Use of Project Water Outside of Service Area.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 15(a), the State hereby consents to the District storing project water outside its service area for later use within its service area in
accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this article and to the District selling
project water for use outside its service area in accordance with the provisions of
subdivision (d) of this article.

(b) Groundwater Storage Programs.

The District shall cooperate with other contractors in the de velopment and
establishment of groundwater storage programs.

(c) Storage of Project Water Outside of Service Area.

(1) A contractor may elect to store project water outside its service area for later use within its service area, up to the limits and in accordance with the provisions provided for in this subdivision (c) and any applicable water right laws, by setting forth on the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted to the
State on or before October 1 of each year pursuant to Article 12(a) the quantity of
project water it wishes to store in the next succeeding year. There shall be no
limit on the amount of project water a contractor can store outside its service area
during any year in a then existing and operational groundwater storage program.
The amount of project water a contractor can add to storage in project surface conservation facilities and in nonproject surface storage facilities located outside
the contractor's service area each year shall be limited to the lesser of the percent
of the contractor's Table A annual entitlement shown in column 2 or the acre-feet
shown in column 3 of the following table, depending on the State's final water
supply allocation percentage as shown in column 1. However, there shall be no
limit to storage in nonproject facilities in a year in which the State's final water supply allocation percentage is one hundred percent. These limits shall not apply to water stored pursuant to Article 12(e).

Article 56(c)

(2) Storage capacity in project surface conservation facilities at any time in excess of that needed for project operations shall be made available to requesting contractors for storage of project and nonproject water. If such storage requests exceed the available storage capacity, the available capacity shall be allocated among contractors requesting storage in proportion to their annual entitlements designated in their Table A's for that year. A contractor may store water in excess of its allocated share of capacity as long as capacity is available for such storage.

(3) If the State determines that a reallocation of excess storage
capacity iS needed as a result of project operations or because of the exercise of a contractor's storage right, the available capacity shall be reallocated among contractors requesting storage in proportion to their annual entitlements designated in their Table A's for that year. If such reallocation results in the need to displace water from the storage balance for any contractor or noncontractor, the water to be displaced shall be displaced in the following order of priority:
First, water, if any, stored for noncontractors.
Second, water stored for a contractor that previously was in excess of that contractor's allocation of storage capacity.
Third, water stored for a contractor that previously was within that contractor's allocated storage capacity.

The State shall give as much notice as feasible of a potential displacement.

(4) Any contractor electing to store project water outside its service area pursuant to this subdivision may not sell project water under the provisions
of subdivision (d) of this article during the year in which it elected to store project water. This limitation shall not apply to replacement water furnished to Castaic and Perris Reservoirs pursuant to Article 54, or to the storage of water introduced into a groundwater basin outside a contractor's service area if recovery is intended to occur within that contractor's service area.

(5) The restrictions on storage of project water outside a contractor's a service area provided for in this subdivision (c), shall not apply to storage in any project offstream storage facilities constructed south of the Delta after the date of this amendment.

146

Articles 56(c), 56(d)

(6) For any project water stored outside its service area pursuant to this subdivision (c), contractor shall pay the State the same (including adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water as the contractor pays for the transportation of annual entitlement to the reach of the project transportation facility from which the water is delivered to storage. If annual entitlement is stored, the Delta Water Charge shall be charged only in the year of
delivery to interim storage. For any stored water returned to a project transportation facility for final delivery to its service area, the contractor shall pay the State the same for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water calculated from the point of return to the aqueduct to the turn-out in the contractor's service area. In
addition, the contractor shall pay all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State, which shall not include any administrative or contract preparation charge.
Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower costs, which would not be incurred if such water were scheduled for or delivered to the contractor's service area
instead of to interim storage outside the service area. Only those contractors not participating in the repayment of a reach shall be required to pay a use of facilities charge for use of a reach for the delivery of water to, or return of water from, interim storage.

(7) A contractor electing to store project water in a nonproject facility within the service area of another contractor shall execute a contract with that a other contractor prior to storing such water which shall be in conformity with this article and will include at least provisions concerning the point of delivery and the time and method for transporting such water.

(d) Sale of Project Water For Use Outside Service Area.

(1) If in any year a contractor has been allocated annual entitlement
that it will not use within its service area, the contractor has not elected to store
project water in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this article during that year, and the contractor has not elected to carry over entitlement water from the prior year pursuant to the provisions of Article 12(e), the contractor may sell such annual entitlement for use outside its service area in accordance with the
following provisions.

(2) Each year the State shall establish an annual entitlement water pool (the Pool) for contractors wishing to sell or buy project water pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision. The Pool shall constitute the exclusive means of selling portions of annual entitlements not desired by contractors that year.

147

Article 56(d)

Contractors willing to sell to or buy water from the Pool shall notify the State in writing of their desire to do so indicating the quantity to be sold or purchased. Contractors shall have the first priority to purchase all water placed in the Pool. The State may purchase any water remaining in the Pool not purchased by contractors at the same price available to contractors and use such water for the
purpose of providing additional carryover storage for contractors: Provided, that the State shall consult with the contractors prior to making any such purchases.

(3) Each year, the price per acre-foot to be paid by the State to contractors selling water placed in the Pool on or before February 15 that is purchased by a contractor requesting such purchase by March 1 or by the State on March 1 shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Delta water rate as of that date. The price per acre-foot to be paid to the State for the purchase of water from the Pool by a contractor placing a request for such purchase on or before March shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Delta water rate as of that date. Any water placed in the Pool on or before February 15 that is not purchased by contractors or the State by March 1 may be withdrawn from the Pool by the selling contractor.

(4) Each year the price per acre-foot to be paid by the State to contractors selling water remaining in the Pool or placed in the Pool after
February 15, but on or before March 15 that is purchased by a contractor
requesting such purchase by April 1 or by the State on April shall be equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Delta water rate as of that date. The price per acre-foot to be paid to the State for the purchase of water from the Pool by a
contractor placing a request for such purchase between March 2 and April 1 shall be equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Delta water rate as of the later date. Any water placed in the Pool on or before March 15 that is not purchased by a contractor or the State by April may be withdrawn from the Pool by the selling contractor.

(5) If there are more requests from contractors to purchase water from the Pool than the amount in the Pool, the water in the Pool shall be allocated
among those contractors requesting such water in proportion to their annual entitlements for that year up to the amount of their requests. If requests to
purchase water from the Pool total less than the amount of water in the Pool, the
sale of Pool water shall be allocated among the contractors selling such water in proportion to their respective amounts of water in the Pool.

148

Articles 56(d), 56(e), 56(f)

(6) Any water remaining in the Pool after April that is not withdrawn by the selling contractor shall be offered by the State to contractors and noncontractors and sold to the highest bidder: Provided, that if the highest bidder is a noncontractor, all contractors shall be allowed fifteen days to exercise a right of first refusal to purchase such water at the price offered by the noncontractor. The price to be paid to the selling contractor shall be the amount paid by the buyer exclusive of the amount to be paid by the buyer to the State pursuant to
subdivision (d)(7) of this article.

(7) For any water delivered from the Pool to contractors, the buyer shall pay the State the same for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water as if such water were entitlement water, as well as all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State, which shall not include any administrative or contract preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower costs which would not be incurred if such water were not scheduled for or delivered to the buyer. Only those buyers not participating in the repayment of a reach shall be required to pay any use of facilities charge for the delivery of such water from or through the reach. Adjustments from estimated to actual costs shall be computed by the State pursuant to these provisions and shall be paid by the buyer or credited to the buyer at the times and interest rates described in Article 28(c).

(e) Continuance of Article 12(e) Carry-over Provisions.
The provisions of this article are in addition to the provisions of Article 12(e), and nothing in this article shall be construed to modify or amend the provisions of Article 12(e). Any contractor electing to sell project water during any year in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d) of this article, shall not be precluded from using the provisions of Article 12(e) for carrying over water from the last three months of that year into the first three months of the succeeding year.

(f) Bona Fide Exchanges Permitted.
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the District from entering into bona fide exchanges of project water for use outside the District's service area with other parties for project water or nonproject water if the State consents to the use of the project water outside the District's service area. Also, nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the District from continuing those exchange or sale arrangements entered into prior to September 1, 1995, which had previously received any required State approvals. A "bona fide exchange" shall mean an exchange of water involving a contractor and

149

A "bona fide exchange" shall not include a transfer of water from one contractor to another party involving a significant payment unrelated to costs incurred in effectuating the exchange. The State, in consultation with the contractors, shall have authority to determine whether transfers of water constitute "bona fide exchanges" within the meaning of this paragraph and not disguised sales.

contracts.

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final judgment or order determining that any part of a contractor's Monterey Amendment is invalid or unenforceable, all provisions of that amendment shall be of no force or effect as to such contractor, except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (f) of this paragraph.

(d) If any part of the Monterey Amendment of the Kern County Water Agency's or The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's contracts or if the conveyance of the Kern Fan Element of the Kern Water Bank to the Kern County Water Agency provided for in
Article 52 is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or order to be invalid or unenforceable, the Monterey Amendments of all contractors and the Kern Water Bank Contract shall be of no force and effect except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (f) of this
paragraph.

(e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (c), (d) and (f) of this paragraph, if any part of the Monterey Amendment of the Kern County Water Agency's or The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's contract is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or order to be invalid or unenforceable, and if Articles 52 and 53 (i) have been implemented (i.e., the property which constitutes the Kern Fan Element of the Kern Water Bank has been conveyed by the State and the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements have been relinquished to the State), the implementation of the relinquishment shall not be reversed unless the implementation of the conveyance is also reversed, and conversely, implementation of the conveyance shall not be reversed unless implementation of the relinquishment is also reversed. Nothing in this subdivision shall affect any party's right to seek additional damages, compensation or any other remedy available at law or in equity.

(f) The total invalidity or unenforceability of one contractor's Monterey Amendment
as provided for in subdivision (c) of this paragraph or of all contractor's Monterey Amendments as provided for in subdivision (d) of this paragraph or of the Kern Water Bank Contract as provided for in subdivision (d) of this paragraph may be avoided only if such invalidity or unenforceability is explicitly waived in writing signed by the State, Kern County Water Agency and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. In cases arising under subdivision (c) or (d), the affected contractor whose Monterey Amendment has been determined to be partially invalid or unenforceable must first request the waiver.
