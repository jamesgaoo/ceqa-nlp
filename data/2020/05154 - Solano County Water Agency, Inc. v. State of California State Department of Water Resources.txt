2 the 2008 United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Delta Smelt Biological Opinion and

3 with RPA I.6.1 of the 2009 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Salmonid Biological

4 Opinion for the coordinated operations of the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project,

5 and create habitat that is beneficial to Delta Smelt and other fish and wildlife species and widen a
6 portion of the Yolo Bypass to increase flood storage and conveyance (Project) due to:

7 (1) the certification of a legally deficient environmental impact report; and/or

8 (2) a violation of the approved consistent uses allowed for real property subject

9 to a Williamson Act contract; and/or,

10 (3) an inconsistency with the Solano County General Plan.

11 A writ of mandate and preliminary and permanent injunctions are necessary to remedy the

12 DWR's failure to adequately address the Project's environmental impacts; to ensure that the

13 DWR complies with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, and to ensure proper review

14 and disclosure, mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting from the approval and
15 development of the Project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and

16 adopt a Project involving uses that are consistent with the requirements of the Williamson Act

17 and consistent with the Solano County General Plan. By this verified Petition, Petitionen

18 presents:

19 PARTIES

2 California existing under the laws of the State of California. The DWR has a duty under state law

3 to comply with state law requirements, including CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law (in
4 particular the Solano County General Plan), and the Williamson Act when considering the

5 Project.

6 3. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,]

7 corporate, or otherwise, of those Respondents and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does

8 through XXXXX. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said Respondents

9 and Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible for the adoption of, imposition of, or
10 administration of those laws, ordinances, regulations of which Petitioner complains herein.

11 Petitioner will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of the fictitiously
12 named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest when such information has been ascertained.

13 4. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each fictitiously

14 named Respondent and Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for the occurrences

15 herein alleged.

Vogel Property - Approximate 51-acre property in the southwestern

2 portion of the Proposed Project Site bounded by the Bowlsbey Property to the

3 north and Cache Slough to the south, east, and west.

4 Shag Slough Levee State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) levee on the

5 west side of Shag Slough, which borders the eastern boundaries of the

6 Bowlsbey and Liberty Farms Properties. The Shag Slough Levee is part of the

7 Yolo Bypass West levee system.

8 Cache/Hass Slough Levee - SPFC levee located on the north side of

9 Cache and Hass Sloughs, which borders the southern boundaries of the

10 Bowlsbey and Liberty Farms Properties. The Cache/Hass Slough Levee is part

11 of the Yolo Bypass West levee system.
12 • Cache/Hass Slough Training Levee - The Proposed Project includes

13 improvements to the stability of the Cache/Hass Slough Levee and the Cross

14 Levee. The improved levee would function to maintain stage differences

15 between the Proposed Project Site and waters in Cache/Hass Slough during

16 bypass flooding events. The Cache/Hass Slough Training Levee refers to the
17 Cache/Hass Slough Levee and the Cross Levee in their modified post-project

18 state and altered function.

19 • Duck Slough Setback Levee Proposed SPFC setback levee proposed

20 as part of the Yolo Bypass levee system, located on the eastern side of Duck
21 Slough and the southern side of Liberty Island Road.

22 Cross Levee SPFC levee on the southern end of the Proposed

23 Project Site, runs roughly west-east between Cache and Hass Sloughs. • Vogel

24 Levee - Existing agricultural levee located on the eastern, southern, and

25 western boundaries of the Vogel property.

26 Lookout Slough Man-made drainage/water control channel that

27 separates the Bowlsbey and Liberty Farms Properties. Lookout Slough is not

28 connected to Cache Slough and is not open to tidal inundation.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Duck Slough Man-made drainage/water control channel that forms

2 the western boundary of the Bowlsbey Property. Duck Slough is not connected

3 to Hass Slough and is not open to tidal inundation.

4 Sycamore Slough - Remnant of a historical slough, which is no

5 longer connected to Hass Slough and is not open to tidal inundation.

6 6. The Project would restore approximately 3,164 acres of tidal marsh that would

7 help satisfy DWR's obligations under Reasonable and Prudent Alternative 4 of the 2008 USFWS

8 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion, and is consistent with RPA I.6.1 of the 2009 NMFS Salmonid

9 Biological Opinion for the coordinated operations of the State Water Project and the Central

10 Valley Project.

11 7. On or about March 21, 2019 DWR issued a notice of preparation of an EIR for

12 the Project.

13 8. On or about December 16, 2019 DWR issued a Notice of Availability to review

14 draft EIR.

15 9. During the public comment period for the draft EIR Petitioner together with other

16 public agencies and members of the public submitted written comments concerning the draft

17 EIR. Petitioner commented that the EIR employed a truncated analysis and evaluation of

18 significant environmental and water quality impacts resulting in the impacts being underreported,

19 mitigation measures omitted and generally depriving the public of a meaningful opportunity to

20 comment on the EIR due to the omission of relevant information and data in the draft EIR as

21 required by CEQA.

22 10. On or about October 2020 the DWR released a final EIR consisting a of 912 pages,

23 including numerous additions, revisions and deletions of important text from the draft EIR,
24 considerable revisions to the mitigation measures presented in the draft EIR while also adding

25 new mitigation measures and deleting existing mitigation measures. This final EIR was not

26 subject to recirculation for public comments about these numerous changes. To put the size o1

27 this final EIR and the magnitude of the numerous changes to the draft EIR into an

28 understandable context, CEQA Guideline section 15140 explains that a draft EIR should not
KERUM' CRABR#F SUNTAG

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P exceed one hundred and fifty pages, except for exceptional situations. Thus this final EIR is
2 more than six times larger than a typical draft EIR.

3 11. On or about November 2, 2020 DWR certified the EIR and approved the Project.
4 12. On or about November 3, 2020, the DWR posted a Notice of Determination

5 regarding the EIR.

6 13. The Project is discretionary in nature, requiring mandatory substantive findings.
7 The decision-makers were required to exercise judgment and deliberation in determining

8 whether and how to approve the Project.

9 14. The DWR was presented with substantial evidence that the Project would result in
10 significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated in the EIR.
11 15. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the Project.
12 Petitioner's representatives and other members of the public objected orally and in writing, and
13 presented evidence that the Project has the potential to cause significant environmental impacts,
14 and that the environmental review considered for the Project does not satisfy the minimum
15 requirements of CEQA.

16 16. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the DWR's full compliance with
17 CEQA, State Planning and Zoning law (in particular the Solano County General Plan), the
18 Williamson Act and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.
19 17. DWR has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, State Planning and
20 Zoning Law (particularly the Solano County General Plan), the Williamson Act and all other
21 applicable laws when approving the Project.

22 18. Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.

23 19. Petitioner will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmentall
24 impacts that may result from the Project.

25 20. Petitioner has standing to bring this action and seek to compel a public duty in the

26 form of Respondent complying with State and local land use and environmental laws.

27 21. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code §21167.5 by
28 mailing written notice of this action to DWR.
KENUM CRARIAFF SUNTAS

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 22. Petitioner has complied with Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc,

2 §388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.

3 23. Petitioner has a right to enforce DWR's mandatory duties under State and locall

4 law related to the Project.

5 24. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary
6 course of law.

7 25. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and
8 Petitioner by Respondent fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law prior to
9 certifying the EIR and approving the Project. A clear and significant benefit will be
10| independently conferred upon the general public by the Respondent fully satisfying the
11 requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law (in particular the Solano County General

12 Plan), and the Williamson Act. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement

13 of a mandatory duty. The public, of which Petitioner is a member is vitally and beneficially

14 interested in assuring the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief

15 requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that
16 fundamental rules of law would be affected.

17 26. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

18 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ

19 of Mandate and other appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to set aside the DWR approvall

20 of the Project and certification of the EIR.

21 27. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

22 arose in Solano County where both the Project Site and Petitioner are located.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Violation of CEQA: DWR Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion and Did Not

25 Comply with the Vital Public Involvement Objective of CEQA by Failing to Provide A Meaningful Public Comment Period as Required by CEQA Concerning the Evaluation and
26 Mitigation of Environmental Impacts. Impacts; Unstable Project Description.

27 28. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
28 in Paragraphs 1 through 27.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 29. CEQA Guideline section 15201 reads in part:

2 Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. Each public agency

3 should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement,
formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities and procedures, in
4 order to receive and evaluate public reactions to environmental issues related to the agency's activities.
5

6 Public Resources Code section 2100(e) states that "[e]very citizen has a responsibility to

7 contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment." Furthermore, if the

8 I deficiencies in an EIR "preclude[] informed decision-making and public participation, the
9 goals of CEQA are thwarted and a prejudicial a abuse of discretion has occurred." Bakersfield

10 Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal. App. 4th 1184, 1220.

11 30. In this instance Petitioner, other public agencies, and other members of the public,

12 submitted comments about the draft EIR during the designated public comment period.

13 However, the quantity and quality of changes to the draft EIR as part of the final EIR process

14 nullified the statutory purposes and objectives of a public comment period. Due to the wholesale

15 changes to the draft EIR incorporated by the final EIR process, the public was deprived of a

16 meaningful opportunity to comment on the substantially revised EIR actually certified by DWR.
17 Stated slightly differently, the final EIR certified by the DWR is substantially different than the

18 draft EIR subject to public review and comment by Petitioner and other members of the public.
19 31. For purposes of illustration, more specifically the final EIR changes the text of the
20 draft EIR over at least fifty-three pages, with some pages experiencing multiple changes. The
21 changed pages include: II-22, II-23, II-24, I1-25, 2 II-6, II-27, II-28, II-29 II-30, II-31, II- 34, II-
22 35, II-38, II-43; III-6, III-34, III-35, III-39; IVA- 8, IVA-19, IVB- 6, IVB- 12, IVC-13, IV D- 43,

26 32. For purposes of illustration in addition, the final adopted EIR significantly
27 changed at least thirty-nine mitigation measures. Many mitigation measures presented in the
28 draft EIR experienced multiple changes, and entirely new mitigation measures were added. The

8 environmental topics addressed in the draft EIR.
33. For illustration purposes only, the following additions and deletions to
10 mitigation measure presented in the Air Pollution topical section of the draft EIR illuminates the

11 quality and magnitude of changes made during the final EIR process, changes that were not
12 subject to public comment and review:

5 Tier 4 Interim, Tier 3, and then Tier 2 engines.

6 For purposes of this mitigation measure, "commercially available" shall mean the availability of Tier 4 Final engines similar to the availability for other large-scale
construction projects in the region occurring at the same time and taking into

8 consideration factors such as (i) potential significant delays to critical-path timing of construction for the project and (ii) geographic proximity to the Proposed

24 average daily PM10 emissions do not exceed 80 pounds per day for PM10 to meet YSAQMD's significance thresholds as stated in Table IV.C-4 on the previous
25 page.

26 34. In addition, the final EIR included an Appendix X, entitled "Resource

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Appendix includes approximately Five Hundred and One pages: 148 pages of new narrative text,
2 7 pages of new modeling boundaries, 4 pages of new water quality modeling calibrations, 166

3 new figures taking up 216 pages, and 13 new tables taking up 125 pages. None of this extensive

4 data text or modeling was provided for or subject to public comment.

5 35. As an integrated part of these enormous draft EIR changes, the final EIR changed 01
6 revised at least thirty-nine Biology mitigation measure that had previously been reviewed during
7 the public review period, adding at least fifteen entirely new mitigation measures after the public

8 review period concluded, deleting at least five mitigation measures that had been presented in the
9 draft EIR and subject to comment by the public, and provided approximately 148 pages of new
10 modeling narrative, approximately 11 pages of new modeling boundaries and calibrations.

11 approximately 216 pages of new figures and approximately 125 pages of new tables. All of these
12 events occurred after the public comment period concluded and, therefore, were not subject to
13 public scrutiny and formal public comment.

14 36. None of the changes referenced in Paragraphs 34 and 35 above and other changes
15 generally, but not specifically referenced, were subject to a noticed public comment period. The

16 quality and quantity of changes and revisions to the draft EIR preempted the effectiveness of the
17 designated public comment period, rendering the comment period a nullity in relationship to the

18 EIR that DWR actually certified. Vast portions of the EIR certified by DWR were never subject
19 to a public comment review as contemplated and required by CEQA.
20 37. The conclusion presented in the final EIR that these changes were not substantial
21 or significant is without substantial evidence, and was not tested through a noticed or formal
22 public comment period.

23 38. The revisions to, deletions and additions of mitigation measures constitutes a new
24 Project Description which was never subject to public review. Without a stable and finite Project

25 description an EIR cannot fulfill the statutory duty to provide information and data about the
26 | significance of potential environmental effects that may be caused by a project.
27 39. Wholesale changes to the draft EIR, as identified in Paragraphs 34 and 35 renders
28 the draft EIR public comment period ineffective and not compliant with CEQA's requirement for

2 failure to proceed in a manner required by law.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 DWR Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion By
5 Not Recirculating the Vastly Changed EIR

6 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
7 in Paragraphs 1 through 39.

8 41. Public Resources Code section 15088.5 compels a public agency to recirculate an
9 environmental impact report in certain instances. Public Resources Code section 15088.5(a)(1)-
10 (4).

11 42. The final EIR for the Project was changed so significantly that it did not even
12 resemble the Draft EIR; such changes included:
13 A. changes to one or more portions of text from at least fifty-three pages of the
14 draft EIR,

15 B. Revisions to at least 39 Biological mitigation measure and other mitigation
16 measures concerning other environmental topics,
17 C. The additional of at least fifteen entirely new Biological mitigation measures
18 and other mitigation measures concerning other environmental topics,
19 D. The deletion of at least five mitigation measures,

20 E. Inclusion of approximately 148 pages of new modeling narrative,
21 F. Inclusion of approximately 11 pages of new modeling boundaries and
22 calibrations,

23 G. Inclusion of approximately 216 pages of new figures, and
24 H. The addition of approximately 125 pages of new tables.
25 All of these extensive changes occurred after the public comment period concluded, and,

1 Over 900 pages of text, figures and tables were required to be added to the draft EIR after the

2 public agency received comments from the public and affected public agencies in an attempt to

3 address the inadequacies disclosed by the comments.

4 44. In addition, the wholesale changes to the draft EIR rendered public comments

5 virtually meaningless. The public was deprived of an opportunity to comment on more than fifty-

6 three pages of the draft EIR, 39 different biological mitigation measures including the inclusion

7 of fifteen new Biological measures and the deletion of at least five Biological measure (together

8 with additions, deletions and revisions to numerous mitigation measures concerning other
9 environmental topics), 148 pages of new modeling narrative and hundreds of pages of new
10 figures and tables. The public never had the opportunity to comment on vast portions of the EIR
11 that were deficient during the public comment but which DWR attempted to cure after the public
12 comment period lapsed.

13 45. Under these circumstances certifying the EIR by dispensing with the recirculation
14 process was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate
17 the Impacts to Municipal Water Operations

18 46. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
19 in Paragraphs 1 through 45.

20 47. Petitioner is a party to a legally binding contract with DWR to receive water from
21 the State Water Project from the NBA, diverted from the area where the proposed Project would
22 be located. The draft EIR's discussion concerning salinity and bromide does not constitute a
23 reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis, and the presentation of facts and information as
24 required by CEQA. Changes in salinity and bromide will impact Petitioner's operations
25  concerning cost, quality, ability to treat, and quantity of water available to divert, of the
26 municipal drinking water supply. The draft EIR's conclusion that the impact to Petitioner's waten
27 supplies are less than significant is not supported by the data, modeling or analysis.

1 48. The Project also proposes to make significant modifications to the flood storage
2 capacity of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Unit 109, which could result in the permanent loss of

3 40,000 acre-feet of storage. (DEIR, p. II-39.) The DEIR does not propose solutions to replace the

4 potential loss of Unit 109 storage it potential, nor does it propose mitigation for the removal of a

5 potential 40,000 acre-foot loss of storage. This represents a permanent and irreversible

6 modification in the Unit 109 operation, performance and level of flood protection afforded Unit

7 109. This is significant impact, but is not disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in the DEIR.

8 Salinity and Bromide.

9 49. In its February 13, 2020 letter commenting on the draft EIR, Petitioner

10 underscored the draft EIR's failure to evaluate the impact of salinity and bromide on municipal

11 water and municipal water intake operations. Petitioner wrote:

12 The DEIR discussion on salinity is considerably sparse and lacking in sufficient

13 detail, to protect the municipal and agricultural beneficial uses in the Delta. No
analyses, modeling results, or data are provided in the DEIR or Appendices for
14 agencies to proficiently assess the Project's Impacts. In addition, there is also no

15 discussion, analysis, or modeling of Bromide which is of critical importance to municipal users in the Delta. When municipal water supplies are treated to meet
16 drinking water standards, Bromide can form Bromate a known and regulated carcinogen, which can impact human health. Municipal water purveyors in the
17 Central and South Delta, including CCWD, are highly sensitive to changes in

18 Bromide concentration in the Delta. In the North Delta, the NBA municipal users do not currently have significant issues with Bromide. However, major land use
19 changes such as Lookout Slough, have the potential to enhance sea water intrusion upstream of Rio Vista, and elevate Salinity and Bromide above baseline
20 concentrations. Since many of the water purveyors utilize ozone (to deal with

21 high levels of organics), they would be highly sensitive to changes in Bromide above baseline conditions. A more significant analysis of Salinity.
22 50. The DEIR evaluates the Project's impacts on salinity using results from a
23 simulation for 2009, but the selection of a single year does not account for uncertainties and
24 variations found in the hydrologic conditions in the Delta. (DEIR, p. IV.G-22.) The standard
25 technical analyses for CALFED storage projects involve a longer simulation period (either 1922-
26 2003 or 1976-1991) that covers a wide variety of hydrological conditions to evaluate the
27 potential consequences of & project that would change Delta hydrodynamics. Specifically, thesel
28 longer simulation periods include droughts and wet-year periods of varying magnitude and

1 length to better demonstrate existing conditions in the Delta. A proper impact analysis requires a

2 longer simulation of the project under varying hydrologic conditions to better understand how

3 the Project will impact salinity over time.

4 51. The DEIR's evaluation of the Project's impacts on salinity for drinking waten

5 purposes is legally defective. The draft EIR's analysis fails to demonstrate whether the Project

6 would adversely impact drinking water standards due to different salinity impacts. The drinking

7 water salinity impact discussion is conclusory, and does not refer to supporting information or

8 reports in a way that facilitates a reader locating this information. CEQA requires that relevant

9 information related to potential impacts on the environment be presented in the EIR itself, not

10 hidden away in an appendix or report, in order to fulfill the goals of CEQA as a means of agency
11 accountability.

12 52. In response, Petitioner expressly requested more information and data in order to

13 comply with CEQA and to permit the EIR and the public to evaluate the potential impact to

14 municipal water supplies:

15 As part of the DEIR review, the Solano County Water Agency requested model

16 output information from DWR. Only the model results from the City of Vallejo
Pumping Plant will be discussed in this letter, due to its close proximity to the
17 Lookout Slough project, and to illustrate regional concerns in regards to model confidence. Figure
18 is a time series plot for July-2009 showing measured and modeled EC data for the City of Vallejo's Pumping Plant at Cache Slough. Figure

19 2 is a Scatter Plot showing the Measured vs Modeled EC data for this same time period. The corresponding R2 = 0.09, which indicates very poor correlation. The
20 two figures illustrate the challenge of the RMA model to reasonably simulate EC

21 during typical summer conditions at the City of Vallejo's Pumping Plant location.
This is important, as the Lookout Slough project is located in close proximity to
22 this node, and is an indication of poor model confidence. Additional model analyses, comparisons, and transparency on the model development is needed, to
23 improve overall model confidence and ability to reasonably simulate Project

24 Impacts on water quality.

25 Organic Carbon.

26 53. In its February 13, 2020 letter commenting on the draft EIR, Petitioner
27 also noted that the draft EIR failed to evaluate the impact of the potential for increased

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 organic carbon from the Project to adversely impact municipal water quality. Petitioner

2 wrote:

3 the DEIR does not include any discussion or analysis of Organic Carbon.
4 While Organic Carbon may have ecological benefits, it can also have significant impacts on municipal water quality. In the drinking water treatment process,
5 Organic Carbon can react with Chlorine to form a variety of Disinfection Byproducts including Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Haloacetic Acids (HAAs)
6 which are carcinogenic and harmful to human health. The NBA water purveyors
7 are highly sensitive to Organic Carbon levels, as users will often need to blend or switch water sources (if possible), or aggressively treat NBA source water to
8 maintain safe high-quality municipal drinking water standards. Additionally, the NBA currently experiences the poorest water quality throughout the entire SWP 9 in regards to Total Organic Carbon (TOC) levels, as illustrated by Figure 1. Major
10 land use changes such as Lookout Slough, have the potential to export Organic Carbon and/or modify hydrodynamic process that may further degrade NBA
11 municipal water quality.

12 54. In its response to comments, DWR states: "[t]he Draft EIR did not include an
13 analysis of the Proposed Project effect on TOC because there is no regulatory standard to form a
14 significant threshold to determine effects on TOC levels". However, the obligation to prepare
15 good faith responses to comments to an environmental impact is not dispensed with in instances
16 where no regulatory standard to form a threshold of significance for the identified impact,
17 Furthermore, DWR did not explain why the absence of a regulatory threshold of significance
18 precluded DWR from preparing a good faith response to the comment or alternatively
19 formulating a non-regulatory created threshold of significance for this situation. This is
20 inconsistent with the fact that CALFED agencies, of which DWR is a member, adopted its own
21 TOC water quality target in its August 2000 Record of Decision as follows:
22 CALFED Agencies' target for providing safe, reliable, and affordable drinking
23 water in a cost-effective way, is to achieve either: (a) average concentrations at Clifton Court Forebay and other southern and central Delta drinking water intakes
24 of 50 ug/L bromide and 3.0 mg/L total organic carbon, or (b) an equivalent level

25 of public health protection using a cost effective combination of alternative source
waters, source control and treatment technologies.

1 55. Petitioner also commented that the draft EIR omitted significant municipal waten
2 intakes and the potential hydrodynamic changes caused by the Project:
3 In addition, the DEIR does not discuss the importance and sensitivity of Contra
4 Costa Water District's (CCWD's) four municipal intakes located at Mallard Slough, Rock Slough, Old River and Victoria Canal which can be highly
5 influenced by hydrodynamic changes in the Delta and Suisun Marsh. In addition, it should be noted that CCWD provides municipal water to over 500,000 residents 6 in Contra Costa County and the NBA to 500,000 residents in Napa and Solano
7 Counties. The City of Vallejo also has water rights that predate the State Water Project (SWP) on Cache Slough, and provides municipal drinking water to over
8 120,000 residents within the City as well as Travis Air Force Base.

9 56. This omission results in omitting and overlooking potential impacts, relevant data and
10 information, and resulted in a defective evaluation of a significant environmental impact.
11 Certifying the EIR amounts to a failure to proceed a in a manner required by law.
12 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts to Agriculture.
14
57.
15 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

16 in Paragraphs 1 through 56.

58.
17 Water quality and water level impacts resulting from the Project may reduce the

18 ability of existing agricultural water diverters to meet the water needs of their agricultural crops.

19 This in turn could suppress food production, or cause some acreage to be fallowed. The potential

20 impacts to agriculture from changed operations at water intakes constitute a directly foreseeable

21 impact on the physical environment due to the Project; however, these impacts were not studied
in the EIR.
22
59.
23 The Project directly converts significant land currently in agricultural production

24 to non-agricultural uses. Contrary to the undocumented conclusion in the draft EIR, agricultural
conservation easements do not lessen the significance of the loss of agricultural land. Instead 25

26 conservation easements are not valid mitigation for the loss of agricultural land because such

27 easements in no way offset the actual loss of agricultural land involved in a project, but instead
merely prevent other agricultural land in the region from also being developed. The draft EIR 28

KAUM CHARTAF SSUNTAS contains no evidence demonstrating that conservation casements mitigate the impact of the loss

1 of this farmland. The failure of this measure to mitigate the impact of removing these lands from
2 agricultural production results in the impact remaining significant and unavoidable. DWR, in this

3 instance, failed to make the required Statement of Overriding Consideration.
4 60. A deficient analysis of the potential loss of agricultural land or threatened

5 reduction in the productivity of agricultural land rendered the EIR legally insufficient and it was

6 an abuse of discretion for DWR to certify the EIR. In addition, the agricultural conservation

7 easement mitigation measure does not lessen the impact from the loss of agricultural land and the
8 imposition of this mitigation measure was an abuse of discretion.
9 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
10 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts Of
11 The Increase of Endangered Species Intended To Be Created By The Project on Agricultural and Municipal Water Users. 12

13 61. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

14 in Paragraphs 1 through 60.

15 62. Petitioner's comments on the DEIR noted a complete failure to evaluate the

16 impacts of the increased endangered species intended to be created from the Project on both

17 agricultural and municipal users:

18 the DEIR and Appendices do not include any analysis, assessment, potential impacts, or recommended solutions to minimize impacts to existing agricultural
19 and municipal users in the Delta and specifically within the [Cache Slough

20 ComplexJCSC. Within the CSC, several public agencies including SCWA and Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (via the NBA), City
21 of Vallejo, and Reclamation District 2068 have major diversion facilities, as well as numerous private agricultural intakes. as part of Appendix E (Good
22 Neighbor Checklist), DWR has not adequately addressed one of the key elements,

23 which is "..are species on the project site expected to increase markedly in abundance and move from the site to neighboring lands or waterways?"
24 63. DWR'S response addressed only agricultural diversions; and that response is
25 inadequate, stating only:
26 Agricultural diversions in the region of the Proposed Project are currently located
27 in critical habitat for several listed fish species, and thus they are already subject

28 to compliance with the state and federal endangered species acts. Therefore, the potential outcome of increased numbers of listed fish species is not an adverse

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 environmental effect of the Proposed Project that must be analyzed and mitigated

2 by DWR in the EIR.

3 The response is nonsensical; the presence of listed and endangered species at the location of
4 agricultural diversions makes diversion difficult or impossible. The Project is intended to

5 increase the population of listed and endangered species; therefore, the Project will adversely
6 impact the ability of agricultural water users to divert water in the location of the Project. This

7 adverse impact was ignored in the DEIR, and summary dismissed in the FEIR.

8 64. The DEIR did not discuss how the Project's intended consequence of increasing

9 the numbers of listed and endangered species would adversely impact the ability of municipal

10 water users to divert. Despite Petitioner's comments pointing out this deficiency, DWR did not

11 respond to these comments, or evaluate the potential impact.

12 65. At the NBA, the location at which water is diverted to Petitioners and others to
a 13 serve a population of over 500,000 people in Napa and Solano County, DWR's operations are
14 governed by a 2019 USFWS Biological Opinion and March 2020 Incidental Take Permit that
15 imposes restrictions on the amount of water that can be pumped in relation to the number of delta

16 smelt present. For example, the Incidental Take Permit provides:

17 From March 1 through June 30 of dry and critical water years, Permittee shall

18 reduce maximum seven-day average diversion rate at BSPP [Barker Slough
Pumping Plant] to less than 60 cfs when larval DS [Delta Smelt] are detected.
19 In addition, in its weekly meetings from March 1 through June 30, the Smelt Monitoring Team shall review DS abundance and distribution survey data and
20 other pertinent abiotic and biotic factors that influence the entrainment risk of

21 larval DS at the BSPP (including temperature and turbidity). When recommended by the Smelt Monitoring Team, and as approved through the decision-making
22 processes described in Conditions of Approval 8.1.3 and 8.1.4, Permittee shall

23 reduce the maximum seven-day average diversion rate at BSPP to less than 60
cfs.

Therefore, the increase in delta smelt present in the Cache Slough complex that is a direct

3 to receive water from the NBA, and to meet their water demands from the NBA, by reducing the

4 quantity of water that can be diverted.

7 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of Duty - Study Inconsistency with Plans

9 67. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
10 in Paragraphs 1 through 66.

11 68. CEQA Guideline section 15125(d) requires a legally sufficient EIR to "discuss
12 any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans, specific plans

13 and regional plans."

14 69. The draft EIR did not evaluate and analyze the conflicts between the uses
15 proposed by the Project and the Solano County General Plan.

16 70. A general plan is the "constitution" for long term planning in the area and the
17 general plan sits atop the land use hierarchy of land use regulations.

18 71. The uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano General Plan. The

19 General Plan land use designation for the property subject to this Project is "Agriculture". The
20 uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano County General Plan. A general plan
21 divides a jurisdiction into designated land use areas and generally assigns land uses to each

22 designation subject to implementation by a subordinate zoning classification that shall be

23 consistent with the general plan.

24 72. The Solano General Plan explains that the Agriculture General Plan Designation

25 provides:

26 Areas for the practice of agriculture as the primary use, including areas that

27 contribute significantly to the local agricultural economy, and allows for secondary uses that support the economic viability of agriculture.

6 74. The Project:

7 A. does not present "the practice of agriculture as the primary use";
B.
8 does not "support the economic viability of agriculture"; and

9 C. does not maintain "the validity of the underlying land use designation".

10 75. The draft EIR did not acknowledge or evaluate these inconsistencies, thereby

11 rendering the draft EIR legally deficient.

12 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Violation of CEQA: Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Mitigate Energy Impacts

14 76. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
15 in Paragraphs 1 through 75.

16 77. CEQA Guidelines Appendix F states that CEQA "requires that EIRs include
17 discussion of the potential energy impacts of proposed projects." Appendix F contains detailed
18 specific items that must be included in a legally sufficient analysis of energy impacts by an
19 environmental impact report.

20 78. The EIR does not disclose the extent to which the Project will create energy
21  impacts. See draft EIR at pp.11-114.

22 79. The EIR did not discuss any means or methods of avoiding or reducing
23 inefficient, wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy from this Project as required by
24 Appendix F.

25 80. The EIR failed to satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA Guidelines
26 Appendix F, CEQA Guidelines §15126.4(a)(1), and Pub.Res.C. §21100(b)(3).
27 81. An environmental impact report cannot dispense with needed analysis by
28 concluding a project complies with Title 24 or other general standards. "Although the Building

1 Code addresses energy savings for components of new commercial construction, it does not

2 address many of the considerations required under appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. Thesel
3 considerations include whether a building should be constructed at all, how large it should be.
4 where it should be located, whether it should incorporate renewable energy resources, or

5 anything else external to the building's envelope. ..[C]ompl[ing] with the Building Code does

6 not, by itself, constitute an adequate assessment of mitigation measures that can be taken to

7 address the energy impacts during construction and operation of the project." California Clean

8 Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App. 4th 173 211. Thus applying Title
24 is insufficient to assess the effect and mitigation measures.

10 82. The Appendix F CEQA mandate is implemented by instructing public agencies:
11 "Ip]otentially significant energy implications of a project should be considered in an EIR," and
12 describing several energy-related issues to be evaluated such as energy efficiency, effects to
13 energy supplies, effects on peak and base period demands, compliance with existing energy
14 standards, and transportation energy consumption. Id. at (II)(C). Appendix F explains that
15 compliance starts with the EIR's project description. To produce a legally sufficient analysis, the
16 Guidelines direct an EIR's project description to include a discussion of:

17 • energy consuming equipment to be used by the project (App. F II.A.1.);

18 0 energy requirements of the project by fuel type (App. F II.A.2.);

19 energy conservation equipment (App. F II.A.3.);

20 energy costs (App F. II.A.4.); and

21 energy consumption per vehicle trip (App F. II.A.5.).

22 Likewise, Appendix F suggests an EIR's "environmental setting" section "include existing

23 energy supplies and energy use patterns in the region and locality."

24 83. The DEIR omits any discussion of energy consuming equipment to be used by the
25 Project, energy requirements of the Project by fuel type, energy conservation equipment, energyl

26 costs, or energy consumption per vehicle trip in the "Project Description" section as required by
27 the Guidelines. Further, the environmental setting fails to disclose existing energy supply and

4 by certifying the EIR without first analyzing and/or mitigating the energy impacts of the Project

5 las required by CEQA.

6 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of the Williamson Act

8 85. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

9 in Paragraphs 1 through 84.

10 86. The Williamson Act authorizes counties to adopt a program whereby landowners

11 voluntarily restrict the possible uses of real property in exchange for more favorable methods of
12 calculating real property tax rates. Solano County has entered into the Williamson Act program
13 and the Project is located on a substantial amount of real property subject to enforceable
14 Williamson Act contacts. Three properties involved in the Project are bound by enforceable
15 Williamson Act contracts: Bowlsbey, Liberty Farms and Vogel.

16 87. The proposed Project uses conflict with the permitted and consistent uses as

17 defined by the Williamson Act and local Williamson Act guidelines.

18 88. The Solano County Williamson Act guidelines define open space use as "the use

19 or maintenance of land in a such a manner as to preserve its natural characteristics, beauty, or
20 openness for the benefit and enjoyment of the public, to provide essential habitat for wildlife, or

21 for the solar evaporation of sea water in the course of salt production for commercial purposes".
22 89. The Project does not:

23 A. "preserve the natural characteristics" of the real property; and/or,
24 B. "provide for the enjoyment of the public".
25 90. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program designates almost the entire
26 Bowlsbey property as prime farmland.

5 Act contract when some of the project uses conflict with the permitted and consistent uses

6 according to the Williamson Act constitutes a prejudicial failure to proceed in a manner required

7 by law. DWR should be enjoined from using the real property in a manner inconsistent with the

9 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 The Project is inconsistent with the Solano General Plan

11 93. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
12 in Paragraphs 1 through 92.

13 94. A general plan operates as a "constitution" for long term planning in the area and
14 sits atop the land use hierarchy of land use regulations.

15 95. The uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano County General Plan.
16 The Solano County General Plan land use designation for the property subject to this Project is
17 "Agriculture". A general plan divides a jurisdiction into designated land use areas and generally
18 assigns land uses to each designation subject to implementation by a subordinate zoning

19 classification that shall be consistent with the general plan.

20 96. The Solano County General Plan explains that the Agriculture General Plan
