LOS ANCELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff AERA ENERGY LLC (Aera") hereby amends its Petition for a

2 writ of mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, or alternatively, section

3 1094.5, directed to Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF VENTURA and the COUNTY OF

4 VENTURA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (collectively, "County") and hereby brings the within

5 Amended Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages. In support, Aera hereby alleges as

6 follows:

7 NATURE OF THE CASE

8 1. Aera is a lessee of mineral rights in an active oil field located within the County

9 north of the City of Ventura. The field is identified by the California Geologic Energy

10 Management Division (CalGEM) as the Ventura Field. Aera is in the business of oil and gas

11 exploration, development and production. Aera and its predecessors-in-interest have engaged in

12 such activities in the County for more than a century. The County has greatly benefited from the

13 presence of the oil and gas industry, which has provided jobs and spurred economic activity and

14 development in the region.

15 2. Because the prudent development of California's energy resources is a is a matter of

16 statewide concern, the State of California has long assumed primary responsibility for regulating

17 all aspects of oil and gas operations within the State. The California Legislature has adopted

18 numerous statutes and regulations designed to maximize the wise development of oil and gas

19 resources, while preventing damage to life, health, property and natural resources. The State of

20 California, acting through CalGEM, oversees and regulates all aspects of oil and gas production

21 to ensure the safe recovery of energy resources in the State. Consistent with that authority, before

22 drilling, re-drilling, reworking, or abandoning any oil well, Aera or any other producer of oil and

23 gas resources in the State must first obtain written authorization from CalGEM to ensure that

24 production activities comply with State law. After such authorization is provided, CalGEM

25 conducts regular and comprehensive inspections of production activities, to ensure they are

26 consistent with State law and CalGEM's authorizations. CalGEM also performs annual audits of

27 oil and gas operations to ensure compliance.

28

MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP - 2-

LOS ANCULES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

] 3. Certain aspects of Aera's oil and gas operations are also regulated by Federal Law.

2 Specifically, provisions of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. §7401 et. seq.) regulate emissions

3 resulting from oil and gas activities. Similarly, provisions of the Clean Water Act (42 U.S.C.

4 §300h-4) regulate oil field activities involving the injection of water into the subsurface.

5 Enforcement and implementation of those provisions throughout the State of California have been

6 delegated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to CalGEM.

7 4. As detailed below, the County is now seeking to impinge upon and usurp State and

8 Federal regulation by requiring all oil and gas development within the County to comply with

9 new limitations set forth in the County's 2040 General Plan, to be implemented through "Zoning

10 Amendments" revising Section 8107-5 of the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance

11 ("NZCO") and Section 8175-5.7 of the County's Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("CZO"). These

12 limitations would unlawfully impede Aera's existing operations as well as its planned future

13 operations. The provisions of the 2040 General Plan working in tandem with the Zoning

14 Amendments are preempted by State and Federal law. They also impair Aera's vested right to

15 continue development and production of its leased oil and gas resources within the County and

16 result in a taking of Aera's property interests without just compensation.

17 5. Moreover, in its rush to prepare, consider and ultimately adopt the 2040 General

18 Plan and the Zoning Amendments, the County unlawfully failed to disclose, evaluate and

19 ameliorate a multitude of environmental consequences resulting from their implementation.

20 6. Through this action, Aera challenges the County's adoption of the 2040 General

21 Plan and amendments to Section 8107-5 of the NCZO and Section 8175-5.7 of the CZO, and

22 seeks a writ of mandate and declaratory relief against the County on grounds that, in adopting and

23 approving these documents, the County has adopted policies that are: preempted by State and

24 Federal law; an unconstitutional taking without just compensation; violate Aera's vested right to

25 continue development and production of its leased oil and gas resources within the County,

26 violate the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq.)

27 ("CEQA"), and abuse the County's discretion.

1 7. Aera requests that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Code of Civil

2 Procedure section 1085, or alternatively section 1094.5, directing the County to vacate and set

3 aside its approval of the 2040 General Plan and certification of its environmental impact report

4 relating to the same. Aera further requests that this Court issue a writ of mandate under Code of

5 Civil Procedure section 1085, or alternatively 1094.5, directing the County to vacate and set aside

6 its adoption of Ordinance No. 4568 repealing and reenacting Section 8107-5 of the Ventura

7 County NCZO, and its adoption of Ordinance No. 4567 repealing and reenacting Section 8175-

8 5.7 of the CZO. Aera further requests injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent implementation

9 of Ordinance No. 4568, Ordinance No. 4567, and the 2040 General Plan provisions set forth

10 below, as well as damages for the taking of its property in the event the provisions are upheld.

11 PARTIES

12 8. Aera is a California limited liability company with its principal place of business

13 in Bakersfield, California. At all times relevant to the allegations in this Petition, Aera was

14 engaged in the business of oil and gas exploration, development, and production in California and

15 within Ventura County, specifically.

16 9. The County is a municipal corporation with its county seat in the City of Ventura,

17 California. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors (Board) is the governing body of the

18 County of Ventura.

19 10. Aera is unaware of the true names and/or capacities of Respondents and

20 Defendants DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Defendants

21 by such fictitious names. Aera will amend this Petition to insert the true names and/or capacities

22 of DOES through 25, inclusive, when the same have been ascertained. Aera is informed and

23 believes and thereon alleges that each such fictitiously named Respondent and Defendant is, in

24 some manner or for some reason, responsible for the damage caused to Aera and is subject to the

25 relief being sought in this Petition.

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 11. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085

28 (alternatively, section 1094.5), as well as Public Resources Code sections 21168 and/or 21168.5.

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 12. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394 and

2 395, as the acts and omissions alleged herein took place within the County of Ventura and the

3 County is the Respondent and Defendant in this action.

4 GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5 A. Aera's Production of Oil and Gas in Ventura County

6 13. For more than a century, oil and gas a production has been a critical component of

7 the County's economy. The first commercially viable oil well in the County was drilled in

8 approximately 1916, and the expansion of oil production in the 1920's coincided with, and led to,

9 significant economic growth and development in the region.

10 14. The Ventura Field - a long, narrow field located approximately three miles north

11 of the City of Ventura and extending approximately nine miles in an east-west direction - covers

12 more than 8,000 surface acres and has been the major source of oil and natural gas in the region

13 since the 1920s. It is currently the eleventh largest field in California, producing approximately

14 ten (10) thousand barrels of oil and six (6) million cubic feet of gas per day.

15 15. Aera and its predecessors-in-interest have been actively conducting oil and gas

16 development and production operations in the County since the early 1900s. Today, Aera is the

17 largest onshore oil and gas producer in the County, with oil and gas operations covering

18 approximately 4,300 acres in the Ventura Field. Aera's daily production activities involve nearly

19 one-hundred full-time employees and several hundred contractors and vendors, all working

20 within the County.

21 16. Aera's operations require the use of both production and water injection wells.

22 Production wells remove oil and gas resources from the field; injection wells flood produced

23 water into the geologic formations in which the oil and gas resources are located in order to

24 maintain the reservoir pressure within the geologic formation and continue to push the oil and gas

25 resources into the vicinity of the production wells. The oil and gas production process requires

26 constant drilling and re-drilling of both types of wells depending on the location of the oil and gas

27 within a geologic formation as well as the overall gcology of the field. Re-drilling of a well is

28 often necessary to modify its depth to enable it to access a different portion of a reservoir, extend

PHILLIPS, LLP - 5 -

ATTOINHYS AT LAW
LOS ANGRUS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

the life of the reservoir, or to replace a well which is mechanically compromised and requires

2 abandonment. Aera and its predecessors-in-interest have regularly drilled and re-drilled wells;

3 over the years they have drilled more than 1,900 new wells and re-drilled another 800 in the

4 Ventura Field and, in any given year, numerous wells are drilled or re-drilled as part of Aera's

5 routine field operations.

6 17. The County first promulgated regulations specifically relating to oil and gas

7 production in 1947. The County adopted Ventura County Ordinance No. 412 in March 1947,

8 which, for the first time, separated land uses, including oil and gas exploration, into different

9 categories and authorized such uses in specified areas within the County. Section 16(II)(B) of

10 County Ordinance No. 412 required issuance of a Special Use Permit to conduct oil and gas

11 production operations within the County. Aera's predecessors-in-interest applied for, and

12 received, the following Special Use Permits authorizing production of oil and gas on real property

13 overlaying the Ventura Field:

14 • Special Use Permit No. 19, dated February 24, 1948;

15 Special Use Permit No. 35, dated November 16, 1948;

16 Special Use Permit No. 45, dated April 19, 1949;

17 Special Use Permit No. 48, dated June 21, 1949;

18 Special Use Permit No. 65, dated November 22, 1949; and

19 Special Use Permit No. 445, dated January 24, 1956.

20 (collectively, the "Special Use Permits")

21 18. The Special Use Permits all contain nearly identical authorizing language, granting

22 the permit holder the right to engage in the following activities:

23 "drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and

24 installing and using buildings, equipment and other appurtenances accessory thereto, including pipe lines but specifically excluding processing, refining,
25 packaging, bulk storage or any other use specified in Ordinance No. 412 as requiring review and special use permit."

26 The Special Use Permits did not include any requirement for subsequent discretionary review or

27 approvals from the County and did not include any requirement that the wells or production

28 facilities within the permit boundaries be subject to location, spacing, or other conditions. The
MANATT, PHELFS &
PHILPS, LLP - 6 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELIS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 Special Use Permits also did not include an expiration date or other temporal limitation. Rather,

2 they authorized the permit holder to drill for, and extract, any oil, gas and other hydrocarbon

3 substances within the confines of the permit holder's property and to install the infrastructure

4 necessary to achieve that purpose. (A true and correct copy of a map specifying the real property

5 covered by each Special Use Permit is attached hereto as Exhibit A).

6 19. Under the authority of the Special Use Permits, Aera and its predecessors-in-

7 interest invested hundreds of millions of dollars in wells, tanks, pumps, pipelines and related

8 facilities to pursue full development of the oil and gas resources underlying the lands covered by

9 the Special Use Permits. In addition, on December 4, 1975, Aera was granted Conditional Use

10 Permit No. 3573, authorizing the installation and maintenance of an oil and liquid gas storage

11 tank and loading operation. This facility, which has been constructed and is operational, stores

12 natural gas liquids, which are loaded into trucks and conveyed elsewhere for further processing.

13 20. Through its work and investment in the Ventura Field, Aera has exhibited a clear

14 intent to maintain and expand its operations over the entire tracts of land covered by the Special

15 Use Permits, as necessary, to fully recover all available oil and gas resources. Today, Aera has

16 hundreds of active wells operating in the Ventura Field and plans to install additional wells

17 regularly during the remaining productive life of the Field. Currently, the Ventura Field contains

18 approximately 2.7 billion barrels of remaining oil, a significant portion of which is recoverable

19 and will require several decades to recover.

20 21. Having already authorized the development of Aera's wells, tanks, pumps and

21 related infrastructure via the Special Use Permits, the County has required no additional

22 discretionary review for construction of facilities, installation of new wells, replacement of wells,

23 re-drilling of existing wells or abandonment of wells. If Aera were unable to continue to install,

24 replace, re-drill, rework, and abandon wells and maintain its related production facilities, oil

25 production in the Ventura Field would immediately suffer an accelerated decline and many of

26 Aera's investments would be substantially devalued.

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

B. State Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations

2 22. Aera's development of oil and gas resources in the Ventura Field has long been

3 closely regulated and supervised by the State. More than a century ago, the California Legislature

4 created the agency now known as CalGEM to oversee the beneficial exploitation of oil and gas

5 and to ensure the safe recovery of energy resources in the State. Since that time, CalGEM

6 (formerly known as the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources) has been the primary

7 regulatory authority for oil and gas development in the State.

8 23. Over the years, California has adopted numerous statutes and regulations that

9 comprehensively regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. California law vests

10 complete authority in CalGEM to "supervise the drilling, operation, maintenance, and

11 abandonment of wells so as to permit owners or operators of wells to utilize all methods and

12 practices known to the oil industry for the purpose of increasing the ultimate recovery of

13 underground hydrocarbons and which, in the opinion of the supervisor, are suitable for this

14 purpose in each proposed case.33 Pub. Res. Code §3106(b). Prior to drilling, re-drilling,

15 reworking, repairing, deepening, pressure testing or abandoning a well, Aera is required to notify

16 CalGEM of its intent, submit supporting documentation, and obtain written authorization from

17 CalGEM prior to commencing well operations. Through the 2040 General Plan and related

18 Zoning Amendments, the County is now, for the first time, seeking to inject itself into the

19 approval process.

20 C. The 2040 General Plan and the County's Zoning Amendments

21 24. California law requires that every county and city adopt a general plan "for the

22 physical development of the county or city, and of any land outside its boundaries, which in the

23 planning agency's judgment bears relation to its planning." Gov. Code § 65300. According to

24 the County, all area plans, specific plans, subdivisions, public works projects, and zoning

25 decisions must be consistent with the direction provided in the County's General Plan, which

26 serves as the County's "blueprint" for future decisions.

27 25. In approximately 2015, the County initiated work on updating its existing General

28 Plan. As originally presented to the public and the consultant hired to complete the work, the
MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLEPS, LLP 8 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
1.06 ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

update to the General Plan included updating the General Plan's Housing Element, and updating

2 the County's NCZO and CZO to implement the new General Plan policies. However, the County

3 subsequently decided to treat the Housing Element update and the Zoning Amendments update as

4 separate, unrelated projects.

5 26. The new General Plan, referred to as the 2040 General Plan, is comprised of a

6 collection of nine "elements" or topical categories. One of the elements, "Conservation and Open

7 Space," purports to focus on "the long-term preservation and conservation of the natural and open

8 space environment." (2040 General Plan, at 1-6). Contained within that element is a section

9 devoted to oil and gas resources, which seeks to regulate oil and gas activities within the County

10 by enacting a number of new policies that would constrain and greatly impair ongoing oil and gas

11 production (collectively, the "Oil and Gas Policies"). These policies include, but are not limited

12 to, the following:

13 "COS-7.2 Oil Well Distance Criteria: The County shall require new

14 discretionary oil wells to be located a minimum of 1,500 feet from residential dwellings

15 and 2,500 from any school.

16 COS-7.4 Electrically-Powered Equipment for Oil and Gas Exploration and

17 Production: The County shall require discretionary development for oil and gas

18 exploration and production to use electrically-powered equipment from 100 percent

19 renewable sources and cogeneration, where feasible, to reduce air pollution and

20 greenhouse gas emissions from internal combustion engines and equipment.

21 COS-7.7 Conveyance for Oil and Produced Water: The County shall require

22 new discretionary oil wells to use pipelines to convey oil and produced water; oil and

23 produced water shall not be trucked.

24 COS-7.8 Gas Collection, Use, and Disposal: The County shall require that gases

25 emitted from all new discretionary oil and gas wells shall be collected and used or

26 removed for sale or proper disposal. Flaring or venting shall only be allowed in cases of

27 emergency or for testing purposes."* (2040 General Plan, at 6-12, 6-13).

ATTORNIYS ATLAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 The Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan purport to apply only to "new discretionary"

2 oil wells or development. While the term "new discretionary" is not defined in the 2040 General

3 Plan, regardless of its definition it is of no valid legal effect because the County is preempted

4 from regulating the conduct of oil and gas operations, regardless of whether the operations

5 involve new facilities, or a modification or expansion of existing facilities. Rather, CalGEM is

6 exclusively empowered to regulate oil and gas well operations, including the approval and

7 operation of new wells in existing fields. Through the 2040 General Plan, the County is

8 attempting to regulate in an area fully occupied by State and Federal law.

9 27. In conjunction with the 2040 General Plan, the County also adopted Ordinance

10 Nos. 4567 and 4568 to repeal and reenact Section 8175-5.7 of the CZO and Section 8107-5 of the

11 NCZO (together, the "Zoning Amendments"). The Zoning Amendments are designed to, among

12 other things, ensure the Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan apply not only to all new

13 oil and gas development in the County, but also to the re-drilling or deepening of existing wells,

14 regardless of whether those development activities are currently authorized by existing Special

15 Use Permits. According to the County Planning Division's Board Letter, the Zoning

16 Amendments, which were adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 10, 2020, amend

17 the County Zoning Code:

18 "to require the issuance of a new discretionary conditional use permit (CUP), or

19 approval of a discretionary permit adjustment or modification, to authorize all new oil and gas development, including that proposed under [the Special Use Permits],
20 unless the proposed development is already specifically described as being authorized under an existing CUP. New development triggering the need for

21 discretionary approval would include, but not be limited to, the installation of new wells, tanks and other oil field facilities, and the re-drilling or deepening of
22 existing wells." (November 10, 2020 Board Letter at pg. 6).

23 28. The Special Use Permits held by Aera do not specifically describe the

24 developments that are authorized. Rather, the Special Use Permits were understood and designed

25 to grant the permit holder the right to develop fully its oil and gas resources, consistent with state

26 and federal regulations, without specifically describing each authorized development. Thus, by

27 altering the permitting process to now require a new Conditional Use Permit for all oil and gas

28 development except that which has previously been "specifically described" in prior Special Use
MANATT, PHBLPS &
PHILUPS, LLP 10 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
1O5 ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

- Permits the Zoning Amendments would require Aera to undergo discretionary review (and obtain

2 a new Conditional Use Permit) prior to: (1) installing any new well, tank or other oil field

3 facilities; or (2) re-drilling or deepening any existing well. As a result, the a Zoning Amendments

4 effectuate the County's intent to apply the Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan to all

5 new wells, tanks, and other oil field facilities.

6 29. The Oil and Gas Policies significantly restrict Aera's oil and gas production in the

7 County. For example, Aera currently operates active wells and production facilities within 1,500

8 feet of residential dwellings or 2,500 feet from a school. The Oil and Gas Policies (specifically

9 COS 7.2) would prohibit Aera from maintaining or extending the productive life of those wells by

10 re-drilling or deepening them, and would prohibit Aera from installing new wells in that area, all

11 of which are necessary to maintain production over time. Additionally, the County's requirement
12 that all discretionary development for oil and gas exploration and production utilize electrically-

13 powered equipment from 100 percent renewable sources and cogeneration (COS 7.4) would

14 undermine Aera's ability to drill new wells and re-drill existing wells in the Ventura Field by
15 creating an undue risk to the health and safety of Aera's workers, the public, and the environment.
16 It also directly contradicts the Ventura County Air Pollution District's (a special district with
17 delegated authority from the State and EPA) rules specifically mandating the use of grid power

18 for all drilling operations. The County's prohibition on trucking oil and produced water within

19 the County (COS 7.7) impermissibly disrupts, among other things, Aera's storage tank

20 operations, which rely on trucks to transport oil and natural gas liquids to off-site facilities for

21 further processing.

22 30. Given the hundreds of millions of dollars Aera has invested over decades of work

23 at the Ventura Field, and the work done pursuant to, and in reliance upon the Special Use Permits,

24 Aera's right to continue and to complete the development and production of its oil and gas
25 resources at the Ventura Field is fully vested. The Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan,

26 as implemented through the Zoning Amendments, impose an unconstitutional taking on their

27 face, as they severely constrain and, in some cases completely eliminate, Aera's vested right to

28 continue the development and production of its oil and gas resources at the Ventura Field,
MANATT, PHELPS & 11 - PHILuPs, LLP

1 including the right to drill new wells, re-drill or deepen existing wells, or install tanks, pipelines

2 or other oilfield facilities.

3 D. County Efforts to Impermissibly Impair Oil and Gas Operations

4 31. The County has been impermissibly seeking to interfere with oil and gas

5 operations since at least 2013, despite the fact such operations are exclusively regulated by

6 CalGEM and despite the fact that the right to conduct such operations has vested. For example,

7 on approximately May 21, 2013, the Board directed County staff to investigate the County's

8 ability to regulate the use of fluids used in oil well stimulation and "the options available to

9 address antiquated oil & gas permits" such as the Special Use Permits described above. On

10 approximately December 17, 2013, County staff advised the Board that: (a) the County was

11 preempted from adopting regulations relating to well stimulation fluids and (b) "the County has

12 only a limited ability to address antiquated oilfield permits due to the vested rights doctrine and

13 constitutional takings and due process principles."

14 32. In approximately 2014, County staff again advised County decision-makers that

15 oil and gas operations authorized under antiquated oilfield permits cannot be further conditioned

16 "through an ordinary exercise of the police power for the general welfare." And in approximately

17 2015, County staff again advised County decision-makers that oil and gas operations authorized

18 under antiquated oilfield permits "cannot be unilaterally impaired by the County under its general

19 land use authority." Nevertheless, the County pressed forward with the Oil and Gas

20 Amendments.

21 E. The 2040 General Plan Environmental Impact Report

22 33. As noted above, the County initiated an update to its existing general plan in

23 approximately 2015. On or about January 14, 2019, the County issued a Notice of Preparation

24 ("NOP") of a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Ventura County 2040 General

25 Plan, announcing the beginning of the environmental review process for the 2040 General Plan.

26 34. On January 13, 2020, the County purported to release its Public Review Draft

27 2040 General Plan and simultaneously issued a Notice of Availability ("NOA") of a Draft

28 Environmental Impact Report for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan ("DEIR"). However,
MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP 12 -

ATTOUNEYS ATLAW
VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

the DEIR was not actually distributed until January 14, 2020. Despite the County's

2 acknowledgement of concurrent preparation, neither a draft 2021 Housing Element nor a draft

3 Zoning Code Update was provided to the public, and the environmental impacts of an updated

4 Housing Element and Zoning Code Update were not considered, analyzed, or discussed in the

5 DEIR. No draft 2021 Housing Element has been released to the public to date.

6 35. Instead of releasing a comprehensive Zoning Code Update for public review

7 concurrent with the 2040 General Plan, the County issued the Zoning Amendments separately.

8 Despite the fact that the Zoning Amendments would work in tandem with the various new

9 policies of the 2040 General Plan, the potentially significant impacts of the Zoning Amendments

10 were not disclosed in the DEIR, and no separate environmental review was conducted. The

11 Zoning Amendments were adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 10, 2020.

12 36. In addition to the Zoning Amendments, the 2040 General Plan contemplates

13 myriad other amendments and updates to the County Zoning Code, again, none of which were

14 considered in the DEIR.

15 37. Aera reviewed both the Public Review Draft 2040 General Plan and the DEIR and

16 noted myriad legal, factual, procedural, and substantive deficiencies in these documents. Aera

17 prepared detailed comment letters apprising the County of those deficiencies and submitted

18 comment letters during the DEIR's public review and comment period. Aera also urged the

19 County to revise and recirculate the DEIR and revise the Public Review Draft 2040 General Plan

20 to bring both into compliance with the law. The County refused to do so.

21 38. Instead of significantly revising and recirculating the DEIR and/or the Public

22 Review Draft 2040 General Plan to bring those documents into compliance with the law, the

23 County instead prepared and released a Final Environmental Impact Report for the 2040 General

24 Plan ("FEIR") (together with the DEIR, "EIR"). Despite the FEIR's 1,352-page length (plus

25 another 2,361 pages of attachments), the County released the FEIR to the public late in the day on

26 July 2, 2020, immediately prior to a federal holiday.

27 39. The FEIR included significant new information, new analysis, and incomplete

28 responses to comments received by the County during the public review and comment period for
MANATT, PHELIS &
PHULIPS, LLP 13 -

ATTORNEYSAT LAW
LOS ANCEIS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 the DEIR. For example, the FEIR recalculated greenhouse gas emissions generated by the oil and

2 gas industry based on new and flawed data, but failed to provide a full public review and

3 comment period during which Aera and the public could review and comment upon this new

4 information and new analysis.

5 F. County Planning Commission Consideration of the EIR and 2040 General Plan

6 40. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the various stay at home orders in

7 place at the time, the County Planning Commission considered the 2040 General Plan, and the

8 EIR, at its July 16, 2020, meeting. Aera and others urged the County to postpone the hearing

9 until such time that the County could guarantee that no member of the community would be left

10 out of the process as a result of either technological disparities or public health risks. The County

11 refused to do so.

12 41. The County's posted agenda for the July 16, 2020 Planning Commission meeting

13 did not include any instructions regarding how to participate in the meeting virtually, and gave no

14 indication that virtual participation was even an option. Instead, the County posted inconsistent

15 and confusing instructions on virtual participation at other locations on the County website and

16 then changed its instructions mere hours before the Planning Commission meeting.

17 42. During the meeting, the livestream feed "went offline" several times, and

18 therefore, all members of the public participating virtually were unable to attend portions of the

19 meeting.

20 43. During the meeting, and prior to recommending approval and adoption of the 2040

21 General Plan and certification of the EIR, Planning Commissioners stated that the policies

22 incorporated into the 2040 General Plan prior to CEQA review - had already been immutably

23 "adopted" by the Board in September 2019, and that any document that the Planning Commission

24 recommends to the Board for approval should include only those policies previously "adopted"

25 by the Board. Specifically, Chairman White admonished County staff for implying that proposed

26 General Plan policies could be, or had been, modified by the information contained in the EIR, or

27 that the Planning Commission should consider the EIR in recommending the policies and

28 programs of the 2040 General Plan to the Board. Said Chairman White, "[w]e are not the
MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP 14 -

ATIONNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

deciders on these policies and programs. The Board is the decider." Such statements underscore
2 that the Commissioners: failed to utilize their independent judgment in reviewing both the 2040
General Plan and its EIR; that the Commission hearing was meaningless and a sham; and that the
4 County predetermined and effectively "adopted" the 2040 General Plan before completing

5 environmental review and prior to the public hearings on the same.

6 44. Despite the numerous issues described above, the Planning Commission adopted a

7 motion recommending approval and adoption of the 2040 General Plan and certification of the

8 EIR to the Board.

9 G. The Board's EIR Certification and 2040 General Plan Adoption

10 45. Mere days after the Planning Commission hearing, on July 20, 2020, the County

11 closed its administrative offices completely and moved to an entirely virtual meeting schedule.
12 On September 1, 2020, the Board considered the 2040 General Plan and its EIR exclusively

13 utilizing the demonstrably defective virtual platform.

14 46. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board closed the public hearing, but then

15 also directed County Staff to make several revisions to the 2040 General Plan and EIR documents

16 and bring them back for approval on September 15, 2020. No additional environmental analysis

17 was performed to determine whether these revisions would result in new or different

18 environmental impacts from those disclosed to the public in the EIR.

19 47. On September 15, 2020, the Board adopted Resolution No 20-106, which certified

20 the EIR, adopted CEQA Findings of Fact and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, adopted
21 a Mitigation Monitoring Program, repealed the existing General Plan except for portions

22 constituting the 2014-2021 Housing Element, and approved and adopted the 2040 General Plan

23 and 2040 General Plan Background Report.

24 H. The Board's Adoption of the Zoning Amendments

25 48. At the September 10, 2019, regular Board meeting, County Counsel presented to

26 the Board an overview of the "legal issues and legislative options" regarding "potential

27 amendments to the County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new
28 development under antiquated oil and gas permits." As part of the presentation, drafts of the

2 Zoning Amendments were provided to the public and the Board. Notably, at this same Board

3 meeting, the Board considered a wholly separate agenda item relating to the 2040 General Plan.

4 Neither the Board meeting agenda nor the Board Letters prepared by staff acknowledged the

5 connection and interrelatedness of the 2040 General Plan and the Zoning Amendments.

49.

6 On July a 30, 2020, a mere 14 days after considering the 2040 General Plan and its

7 EIR, the Planning Commission considered, and recommended approval of, the Zoning

8 Amendments to the Board. Prior to the Planning Commission meeting, Aera submitted a detailed

9 comment letter, explaining the myriad legal deficiencies in the proposed Zoning Amendments.

10 Aera's comment letter also notified the Planning Commission that considering the Zoning

11 Amendments separate and apart from the 2040 General Plan, and deeming the Zoning

12 Amendments exempt from environmental review under CEQA, were violations of the law.

50.

13 On November 5, 2020, the County posted its agenda for the November 10, 2020,

14 Board of Supervisors Meeting. Agenda Item No. 47 was identified as: "Public Hearing to

15 Consider Adoption of County-Initiated Amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura

16 County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Ventura County

17 Coastal Ordinance.3 The agenda description included, "Find Project Exempt from California

18 Environmental Quality Act." The agenda description made no mention of the specific

19 exemptions the Board would be relying upon, and made no mention of the EIR prepared for the

2040 General Plan.

20 51.

21 The "Board Letter" prepared by County staff to summarize the actions before the

22 Board, recommended that the Board find that the proposed amendments to the Non-Coastal

23 Zoning Ordinance be found categorically exempt from environmental review under State CEQA

24 Guidelines, section 15308, and that the proposed amendments to the Coastal Zoning Ordinance be
found statutorily exempt under Public Resources Code section 21080.9. Like

25 the posted agenda,

26 the Board Letter made no mention of the EIR prepared for the 2040 General Plan.

52.

27 On November 9, 2020, Aera submitted a detailed comment letter to the Board,

28 identifying numerous legal deficiencies in the proposed Zoning Amendments, as well as in the

MANATT, PHELPS &:
PHILLIPS, LLP flawed process that the County had followed in bringing the Zoning Amendments before the

A TTOKNEYS ATLAW - 16 -

1,06 ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 Board. Among other issues, Aera's comment letter highlighted why the Zoning Amendments

2 could not qualify for an exemption from environmental review.

3 53. Despite the urging of Aera and others to postpone consideration of the Zoning

4 Amendments until such time as the County has corrected the deficiencies in both the

5 Amendments themselves and the process through which the County was considering them, on

6 November 10, 2020, the Board considered adoption of the Zoning Amendments. At the meeting,

7 County staff floated a new a strategy to explain its failure to conduct environmental review of

8 proposed action. Staff claimed that the 2040 General Plan EIR analyzed and disclosed any

9 potential impacts resulting from the Zoning Amendments, despite the fact that the Board Letter

10 found the Zoning Amendments to be categorically exempt from environmental review, and

11 despite Staff's prior acknowledgement that the Zoning Amendment impacts would be broader

12 than those considered in the EIR for the 2040 General Plan. At the meeting, staff similarly

13 presented a new Board Letter, different from the one released to the public with the agenda,

14 asserting the same claim. This revised Board Letter was not made available to the public until

15 several days later.

16 54. At the conclusion of the November 10, 2020 Board Meeting, the Board adopted

17 Ordinance 4567 and Ordinance 4568.

18 55. No notice of determination was posted by the County pursuant to State CEQA

19 Guidelines, section 15094, indicating that the County had relied upon the EIR prepared for the

20 2040 General Plan in approving the Zoning Amendments. Instead, on November 13, 2020, the

21 County filed notices of exemption for the Zoning Amendments.
22 STANDING, EXHAUSTION AND OTHER JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

23 56. Aera participated in the administrative process that resulted in the County's

24 decision to approve the 2040 General Plan and certify the EIR for the same. Similarly, Aera

25 participated in the administrative process that resulted in the County's decision to approve

26 Ordinance No. 4567 and Ordinance No. 4568 resulting in the Zoning Amendments.

27 57. Aera has exhausted all administrative remedies prior to filing this action.

28 Specifically, Aera has objected to the County's actions relating to the 2040 General Plan and

PHILLIPS, LLP - 17 -

LOS ANCEIPS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

Zoning Amendments in multiple correspondences with the County. Aera has submitted public

2 comments to the County during the public review and comment period for the DEIR, prior to, and

3 in reference to, the County's July 16, 2020, Planning Commission Hearing, and prior to, and in

4 reference to, the County's September 1, 2020 and September 15, 2020 Board Hearings. In

5 addition, Aera has submitted public comments to the County prior to, and in reference to, the

6 County's July 30, 2020, Planning Commission Hearing, and prior to, and in reference to, the

7 County's September 10, 2019, and November 10, 2020 Board Hearings, relating to the Zoning

8 Amendments.

9 58. Aera complied with all conditions imposed by law prior to filing this action,

10 including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, by

11 providing notice to the County that this action would be filed. Aera served a Notice of Intent to

12 File its original Petition on the County Clerk's Office by mail on October 9, 2020, a true and

13 correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

14 59. Aera has also complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by providing

15 notice and a copy of the Original Petition to the California Attorney General on October 15, 2020,

16 a and notice and a copy of the Amended Petition on December 15, 2020.

17 60. Aera also previously notified the County that Aera elects to prepare the record of

18 proceedings for the 2040 General Plan in compliance with Public Resources Code section

19 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

20 61. No valid statute of limitation bars this complaint.

21 62. Aera does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

22 63. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public

23 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment and public

24 participation under CEQA. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

25 substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other

26 harms alleged in this Petition. As such, Aera is entitled to the recovery of attorneys' fees under

27 California Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5.

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (For Writ of Mandate, Code Civil Procedure §§ 1085)
64. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs I through
4 63, above.

5 65. The laws of the State of California and the United States preempt the local
6 regulation of the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells within the State of California. The Oil

7 and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan in tandem with the Zoning Amendments are in conflict

8 with, or enter an area fully occupied by, in whole or in part, applicable State and Federal law.
9 66. The State has vested complete authority in CalGEM to "supervise the drilling,
10 operations, maintenance, and abandonment" of tanks, pipelines, wells and other facilities

11 attendant to oil and gas production. Pub. Res. Code §3106(a), (b). CalGEM exercises its
12 authority to carry out a dual mandate: "to permit owners or operators of wells to utilize all
13 methods and practices known to the oil industry for the purpose of increasing the ultimate
14 recovery of underground hydrocarbons" and to "prevent, as far as possible, damage to life, health,
15 property, and natural resources ... Pub. Res. Code §3106.

16 67. Oil and gas operations in California are specifically governed by Division 3 of the
17 Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. Code §3000 et. seq.) and its implementing regulations. These
18 statutes address all aspects of oil and gas exploration and extraction in detail, including notice of
19 intent to drill and abandon ($§ 3203, 3229); bonding (§§ 3204-3207); abandonment ($ 3208);
20 recordkeeping (§§ 3210-3216); blowout prevention (§ 3219); use of well casing to prevent water
21 pollution (§ 3220); protection of water supplies (S§ 3222, 3228); repairs (§ 3225); regulation of
22 production facilities (§ 3270); unreasonable waste of gas (§§ 3300-3314); subsidence (§§ 3315-
23 3347); spacing of wells (§§ 3600-3609); unit operations (§§ 3635-3690); and regulation of oil
24 sumps (§§ 3780-3787). CalGEM's implementing regulations are also extensive and "statewide in

25 application for onshore drilling, production, and injection operations." 14 Cal. Code Regs.
26 §1712.

27 68. CalGEM is exclusively empowered to regulate operations of oil fields, including
28 approval and operation of new wells in existing fields. As a result, CalGEM written approval is

PHILLIPS, LLP - 19 -

1 required prior to commencing all well operations, including but not limited to drilling, reworking,

2 and abandoning wells. 14 Cal. Code Regs. $1714. The comprehensive system of regulations is

3 designed to empower CalGEM to "encourage the wise development of oil and gas resources."

4 Pub Res. Code §3106(d).

5 69. The County has a clear, present, mandatory, nondiscretionary, and/or ministerial

6 duty under the facts of this case to vacate the Zoning Amendments and the Oil and Gas Policies

7 of the 2040 General Plan that restrict or halt Aera's development and production of its oil and gas

8 resources at the Ventura Oil Field. The Oil and Gas Policies are preempted by State and Federal

9 law and are void.

10 70. Aera has a fully vested right to continue and to complete the development of its oil

11 and gas resources at the Ventura Field that is protected by Art. I §§ and 19 of the California

12 Constitution. The Zoning Amendments and the Oil and Gas Policies of the 2040 General Plan

13 effect an unconstitutional per se taking of Aera's vested right to continue the development and

14 production of the Ventura Field.

15 71. The County's Zoning Amendments and 2040 General Plan Oil and Gas Policies

16 thus purport to unlawfully restrict Aera's continued development and production of its oil and gas

17 resources at the Ventura Field in excess of the County's power, authority and jurisdiction, and

18 constitute an abuse of the County's discretion. Aera is entitled to the issuance of a writ of

19 mandate directing the County to vacate Resolution No. 20-106 adopting the 2040 General Plan

20 and the Oil and Gas Policies contained therein. Aera is also entitled to the issuance of a writ of

21 mandate directing the County to vacate Ordinance 4567 and Ordinance 4568, which repealed and

22 reenacted Sections 8175-5.7 and 8107-5.

23 72. Aera has exhausted all available administrative remedies with respect to this facial

24 challenge to the Zoning Amendments and the 2040 General Plan. Aera has no plain, speedy, and

25 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. This Petition was filed timely.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (For Declaratory Relief, Preemption)

28 73. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through
MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP • 20 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANCH.AS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

72, above.

2 74. The Zoning Amendments and the 2040 General Plan, and specifically the

3 provisions regulating oil and gas resources, expressly and impliedly contradict and enter an area

4 fully occupied by comprehensive State and Federal laws. As such, they are preempted and void.

5 75. The County lacks the power, authority, and jurisdiction to regulate the drilling,

6 operation and maintenance of oil and gas wells, as those powers are exclusively functions of the

7 State of California. The laws of the State of California preempt and fully occupy the regulation

8 of drilling of oil and gas wells within the State of California. The County, through the 2040

9 General Plan working in tandem with the Zoning Amendments, attempts to regulate aspects of oil

10 and gas development and production that are fully occupied by State law and, in fact, the Oil and

11 Gas Policies conflict with superior law. The 2040 General Plan is preempted, in whole or in part,

12 by State law, and, as such, the provisions of the 2040 General Plan relating to oil and gas drilling

13 and operations are invalid and without effect.

14 76. Aera is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County disputes the

15 contentions set forth above and nevertheless intends to regulate Petitioner's oil and gas drilling

16 and operations via the 2040 General Plan and the Zoning Amendments.

17 77. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

18 resolve whether the 2040 General Plan and Zoning Amendments are preempted, in whole or in

19 part, by Federal and/or State law.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (For Writ of Mandate, Public Resources Code § 21167, Violation of CEQA)

22 78. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

23 77, above.

24 79. CEQA mandates "that the long-term protection of the environment ... shall be the

25 guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21101 (d).) To that end, CEQA

26 requires that public agencies analyze and disclose the environmental impacts of their actions prior

27 to their approval. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080(a); State CEQA Guidelines [Cal. Code Regs.,

28 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], §§ 15004, 15352(b); Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45
MANATT, PHELPS & PHILUPS, LLP - 21 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELFS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 Cal.4th 116 ["Save Tara"].)

2 80. CEQA's mandates are procedural and informational, as well as substantive.

3 CEQA requires that public agencies avoid or significantly reduce environmental impacts

4 whenever feasible by implementing project alternatives and mitigation measures. (Pub.

5 Resources Code, § 21001(g).)

6 81. A public agency abuses its discretion and fails to proceed in the manner required

7 by law when its actions or decisions do not substantially comply with the requirements of CEQA.

8 (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

9 82. Where a proposed project may result in significant environmental effects, CEQA

10 requires public agencies to prepare an environmental impact report, the purpose of which is "to

11 identify the significant effects on the environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the

12 project, and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or

13 avoided." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.1(a).)

14 83. Whether an environmental impact report fails to include the information necessary

15 for an adequate analysis is of an environmental issue is a question of law, and when reviewed by the

16 courts, the courts do not defer to an agency's determinations. (Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc.

17 V. County of Madera (2001) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102 ["whether an EIR is sufficient as an

18 informational document is a question of law subject to independent review by the courts"].)

19 84. Failure to comply with the basic substantive requirements of CEQA is necessarily

20 prejudicial error, requiring the decertification of any environmental impact report and vacation of

21 any approvals adopted in reliance upon the same. (North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura

22 (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 671.)

23 85. The County has violated CEQA by failing to prepare an adequate environmental

24 impact report that meets all of CEQA's procedural and substantive mandates prior to the Board's

25 action on September 15, 2020 to approve and adopt the 2040 General Plan.

26 86. The County has similarly violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental

27 review whatsoever of the Zoning Amendments, prior to the Board's action on November 10,

28 2020 to approve and adopt Ordinance No. 4568 and Ordinance No. 4567.
MANATI, PHELPS &
PHILLIFS, LLP - 22 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
1,,5 ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 87. The County has violated CEQA by engaging in improper and illegal piecemealing

2. and project segmentation, which occurs when a public agency chops up a proposed project into

3 smaller pieces to create the illusion of fewer environmental impacts, and to hide the true

4 magnitude of its actions. (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of

5 Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214 [CEQA "cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed

6 projects into bite-sized pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no

7 significant effect on the environment"].) CEQA requires that public agencies analyze the "whole

8 of the project," which includes all related actions, all implementation actions, and all reasonably

9 foreseeable subsequent actions. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a), (c)-(d).)

10 88. Among other failings, the County has illegally piecemealed environmental

11 analysis by:

12 (a) Omitting and ignoring the County's pending 2021-2029 Housing Element

13 in the environmental review and adoption of the 2040 General Plan, despite

14 the fact that the 2021-2029 Housing Element will require near immediate

15 and wholly foreseeable revisions to the 2040 General Plan that will change

16 the magnitude of the impacts disclosed in the 2040 General Plan EIR;

17 (b) Refusing to analyze the environmental impacts of the implementation

18 actions established and required by the 2040 General Plan, despite the fact

19 these are reasonably foreseeable and part of the "whole of the project"; and

20 (c) Purposefully considering the Proposed Zoning Amendments in a separate

21 action and without CEQA review, in a classic example of "chopping up

22 proposed projects into bite-sized pieces which, individually considered,

23 might be found to have no significant effect on the environment."

24 89. The County has violated CEQA by failing to provide a complete, adequate, and

25 concrete project description within the DEIR. EIR project descriptions must be accurate, stable,

26 consistent, complete, include all components of a proposed project, and include all foreseeable

27 future activities that are consequences of the project to be approved. (County of Inyo v. City of

28 Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) The County's failure to provide an accurate project
MANATI, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP - 23 -

ATTORNIYS AT LAW
LOS ANGIELIS VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 description violates CEQA on its own, and also undermines each and every environmental impact

2 analysis contained within the DEIR.

3 90. Among other failings, the DEIR's project description is impermissibly vague and

4 incomplete in that it:

5 (a) Fails to identify the location and buildout of new land use designations,

6 making it impossible to analyze fully the impacts of the proposed land use

7 plan;

8 (b) Fails to describe-even in the most general sense--the goals, policies and
implementation programs that will be a imposed as a result of 2040 General
10 Plan adoption and which are likely to result in physical impacts;

11 (c) Buries and scatters key project details throughout a separate, 1,000+ page

12 appendix, and ignores and wholly omits key aspects and reasonably

13 foresecable implementation actions of the 2040 General Plan, such as the

14 concurrently-prepared 2021-2029 Housing Element and the Proposed

15 Zoning Amendments that will be required to implement the 2040 General

16 Plan;

17 (d) Fails to account for last-minute revisions and additions made to the 2040

18 General Plan by County Staff and the Board of Supervisors, long after

19 CEQA review had been completed; and

20 (e) Relies upon flawed assumptions, including but not limited to, erroneous

21 growth projections and false assumptions relating to existing greenhouse

22 gas emissions within the County.

23 91. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately describe the existing

24 environmental setting and project baseline, against which the impacts of the 2040 General Plan

25 must be compared. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15125, 15126.2(a)). Environmental impact

26 reports must "delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining a

27 'baseline' against which predicted effects can be described and quantified" and failure to do so

28 results in a fundamental inability to accurately analyze and disclose environmental impacts.

2 92. Among other failings, the EIR's description of the existing environmental setting

3 and project baseline is flawed in that it:

4 (a) Impermissibly buries description of the existing environmental setting in a

5 1,000+ page appendix;

6 (b) Presents a biased and incomplete accounting of the County's existing

7 greenhouse gas emissions generators; and

8 (c) Relies upon unsupported assumptions, such as a growth rate "chosen by

9 direction of the County Board of Supervisors" instead of one based upon

10 substantial evidence.

11 93. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately analyze the 2040 General

12 Plan's impacts on the existing environment. (Pub. Resources Code, §21100(b); State CEQA

13 Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2).

14 94. Specifically, the County has failed to adequately analyze and disclose impacts of

15 the 2040 General Plan on aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, biological resources,

16 cultural and tribal cultural resources, energy and energy stability, geological hazards, greenhouse

17 gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, human health, wildfire, hydrology, water quality,

18 water consumption and conservation, land use planning, mineral and petroleum resources, noise

19 and vibration, population and housing, public services and recreation, and transportation and

20 traffic. Relatedly, the County has failed to analyze adequately and disclose cumulative impacts.
N 95. By way of example, just some of the ways in which the County's environmental
22 impacts analysis was flawed, include:
8 a) Ignoring the air quality impacts associated with implementation of 2040 General
24 Plan Policies COS-7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.7, and 7.8;

25 b) Failing to account for air quality impacts associated with favoring imported oil

26 over oil produced within the County;

27 c) Failing to consider and disclose impacts on local and statewide energy supplies,

28 requirements for additional energy capacity, impacts on demands for energy, and

impacts on energy resources, as required by Appendix F to the State CEQA
N mtnno Guidelines;

d) Failing to account for the greenhouse gas emissions associated with importing
crude oil developed and produced elsewhere, and shipped, piped, or trucked to
refineries that would otherwise process crude oil from the County;
e) Failing to identify substantial evidence supporting the EIR's conclusions relating

7 to hazards and hazardous materials;

8 f) Failing to analyze changes in water consumption associated with construction,

9 including construction of oil and gas pipelines, and related impacts on hydrology
2= 9 523 and water quality;
g) Failing to analyze and disclose impacts on mineral and resource accessibility;
h) Failing to account for the impacts associated with meeting the County's Regional
Housing Needs Allocation obligations, under which the South Coast Association
of Governments allocates a given portion of California's housing need to the
15 County, and the County must revise its General Plan and Zoning to accommodate

16 that growth; and

17 i) Failing to account for all reasonably foreseeable new car and truck trips.

18 96. The County has violated CEQA by relying upon mitigation measures and 2040

19 General Plan goals, policies and programs, that are legally preempted and therefore cannot be

20 considered to reduce potentially significant environmental impacts. CEQA requires that

21 mitigation measures be fully enforceable, as well as consistent with applicable constitutional

22 standards. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(2), (4).) Nevertheless, the DEIR incorporates

23 into its analysis of environmental impacts actions, policies, and programs that are preempted by

24 State or Federal law, violate existing private property rights, or are simply infeasible, in violation

25 of CEQA.

26 97. The County has violated CEQA by failing to consider, analyze, or disclose the

27 environmental impacts of the EIR's mitigation measures.

28

- 26 - MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LP

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

98. The County has violated CEQA by failing to consider or by wholesale rejecting,

2 without adequate explanation or analysis, alternative or revised mitigation measures brought

3 forward by Aera, others, and/or the County's own planning staff and retained CEQA consultant

4 and that would reduce or eliminate the significant impacts identified in the EIR, or that were

5 erroneously left out of the EIR due to the EIR's flawed impacts analysis.

6 99. The County has violated CEQA by failing to identify a reasonable range of

7 alternatives, and by providing only a flawed alternatives analysis, based upon an incomplete,

8 vague, and piecemealed project description, and flawed impacts analysis.

9 100. The County has violated CEQA by failing to revise and recirculate the DEIR,

10 despite its failure to meet CEQA's substantive and procedural mandates.

11 101. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments

12 raised by Petitioner and others during the public comment and review period for the DEIR.

13 102. The County has violated CEQA by adding significant new information to the FEIR

14 without revision and recirculation of the DEIR.

15 103. The County has violated CEQA by failing to make adequate findings of fact

16 supporting certification of the EIR.

17 104. The County has violated CEQA by failing to adopt an adequate Statement of

18 Overriding Considerations prior to adoption of the 2040 General Plan.

19 105. The County has violated CEQA by committing illegal "predetermination" and

20 committing itself to "adopted" General Plan policies and programs as early as September 2019,

21 despite the fact that the 2040 General Plan's Draft EIR was not completed until January 2020, and

22 its Final EIR not completed until July 2020.

23 106. The County has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thereby

24 prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to comply with CEQA's mandates.

25 107. Aera has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy other than the issuance of a writ

26 of mandate ordering the County to forgo any and all steps in furtherance of the 2040 General

27 Plan, Ordinance No. 4568, and Ordinance No. 4567 unless and until it complies with CEQA.

LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (For Writ of Mandate, Public Resources Code § 21167, Violation of CEQA)

3 108. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs through

4 107, above.

5 109. CEQA mandates that a lead agency consider, analyze, and disclose the

6 environmental impacts of its project approvals, unless the approval qualifies for a statutory or

7 categorical exemption from environmental review. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080; State CEQA

8 Guidelines, §§ 15300-15333.) A public agency abuses its discretion and fails to proceed in the
manner required by law when its actions or decisions do not substantially comply with the
10 requirements of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

11 110. The County has violated CEQA in adopting Ordinance No. 4568 and Ordinance

12 No. 4567 without considering, analyzing, and disclosing the reasonably foreseeable, direct and

13 indirect, environmental impacts of the Zoning Amendments, and by relying on unsupported and

14 inapplicable exemptions from environmental review.

15 111. The County has violated CEQA in relying upon State CEQA Guidelines, section

16 15308, the "Class 8 categorical exemption", in adopting Ordinance No. 4568. Adoption of

17 Ordinance No. 4568 does not qualify for the Class 8 categorical exemption because it is a

18 legislative decision and not a regulatory action. Further, it does not "assure the maintenance,

19 restoration, enhancement or protection" of the environment as required by the exemption, because

20 it limits access to mineral resources of local, regional and statewide importance. (State CEQA

21 Guidelines, § 15308; State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G, §XII(a)-(b).)

22 112. Even if adoption of Ordinance No. 4568 qualified for the Class 8 categorical

23 exemption--and it does not-State CEQA Guidelines, section 15300.2, bars reliance on the Class

24 8 or any other categorical exemption. Under State CEQA Guidelines, section 15300.2, no

25 categorical exemption may apply where a proposed action will have an impact on the

26 environment. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105;

27 World Business Academy v. Cal. State Lands Commission (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 476, 499.)

F existing oil and gas wells, impose more stringent requirements on the operation of such wells,

2 "limit the level of new [oil and gas] development that could be authorized" in the County, and,

3 when considered together with the 2040 General Plan, restrict mineral and gas production to a

4 greater extent than the 2040 General Plan would on its own. County documents also clearly state

5 that Ordinance No. 4568 "would slow and/or reduce the potential expansion of certain new local
oil and gas development." Given that loss of access to mineral resources of local, regional, and
statewide importance constitute environmental impacts, State CEQA Guidelines, section 15300.2,
bars any reliance on the Class 8, or any other, categorical exemption and the County's reliance on
the same violates CEQA.

the 10 113. For all of the same reasons, should the County make any attempt to rely upon

11 Class 8 categorical exemption, or any other exemption, in its adoption of Ordinance No. 4567,

12 this too would constitute CEQA violation.

13 114. The County has violated CEQA in relying upon Public Resources Code, section

14 21080.9, in adopting Ordinance No. 4567. Ordinance No. 4567 is not the "preparation and

15 adoption of a local coastal program." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.9; State CEQA Guidelines,

16 § 15265(a).) Further, the Zoning Amendments to the Coastal Zoning Ordinance have been

17 improperly severed, piecemealed, and segmented from the adoption of Ordinance No. 4568 and

18 the County's 2040 General Plan. CEQA prohibits dividing up a project into smaller projects to

19 qualify for one or more exemptions, including statutory exemptions. (See, e.g., State CEQA

20 Guidelines, § 15192(o).)

21 115. The County has violated CEQA in alleging, at its November 10, 2020 Board

22 meeting and in its revised Board Letter not released to the public until several days after the

23 meeting, that any environmental impacts associated with the Zoning Amendments were

24 accounted for in the 2040 General Plan EIR, when in fact the EIR plainly states that it does not

25 analyze the potential environmental impacts of "implementation actions" including updates to the

26 Zoning Code. Further, County documents admit that "[t]he proposed zoning amendments would

27 make [the restrictive policies of the 2040 General Plan] applicable to a broader range of proposed

28 oil and gas development" than the 2040 General Plan alone.

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

1 116. Given the County's improper reliance on exemptions and/or the General Plan EIR

2 in its adoption of the Zoning Amendments, the County has failed to proceed in the manner

3 required by law, and prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to comply with CEQA's

4 mandates.

5 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Declaratory Relief, Vested Rights)

7 117. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

8 116, above.

9 118. Aera contends that it has a fully vested right to continue and to complete the

10 development and production of its oil and gas resources in the County, consistent with its long-

11 established plans and permits, including, without limitation, Aera's vested rights in its Special

12 Use Permits, CalGEM permits issued and to be issued to Aera, and Aera's vested rights to obtain

13 ministerial permits for its ongoing operations to drill new wells and to re-drill or deepen existing

14 wells in the County in accordance with permitting procedures established by the State of

15 California and Federal law.

16 119. Oil and gas is a diminishing asset, the extraction of which is expected to continue

17 across the entire property covered by Aera's Special Use Permits. Hansen Bros. Enterprises, Inc.

18 V. Board of Supervisors, 12 Cal.4th 533 (1996). Aera has long exhibited its intent to extend its oil

19 and gas operations to its entire property consistent with its vested rights.

20 120. Aera is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County disputes

21 Aera's contentions set forth above, and intends to restrict Aera's oil and gas operations by way of

22 the Zoning Amendments and the 2040 General Plan, and specifically the Oil and Gas Policies

23 contained therein.

24 121. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

25 resolve whether Aera has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and

26 production of its oil and gas resources in the County.

1 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (For Inverse Condemnation, U.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment; California Constitution,

3 Article 1, Section 19)

4 122. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

5 121, above.

6 123. By purporting to eliminate Aera's vested right to continue and to complete the

7 development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County, the 2040 General

8 Plan, working in tandem with the Zoning Amendments, effects a taking of Aera's property. The

9 economic impact of the 2040 General Plan will be severe, as it would virtually eliminate the

10 economic value of Aera's property. Furthermore, the 2040 General Plan and the Zoning

11 Amendments interfere with Aera's reasonable investment-backed expectations, as Aera

12 reasonably expected it could exercise its existing, lawful, and fully vested right to continue and to

13 complete the development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County.

14 124. The 2040 General Plan and Zoning Amendments will force Aera to bear public

15 burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public a as a whole. In enacting

16 the 2040 General Plan and Zoning Amendments the County violates Article 1, Section 19 of the

17 California Constitution, which prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public use

18 without just compensation. The County also violates the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment

19 to the United States Constitution.

20 125. As a direct result of the County's actions as alleged herein, the Oil and Gas

21 Policies of the 2040 General Plan, in conjunction with the Zoning Amendments constitute a

22 taking. To date, Aera has not received any compensation from the County as a result of the above

23 alleged taking or damage to Aera's property rights.

24 126. Aera has been and will be damaged from the taking of its property rights in the

25 Ventura Field, and will suffer damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

26 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Violation of Substantive Due Process)

28 127. Aera incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through

MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP - 31 -

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES VERIFIED AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND AMENDED COMPLAINT

- 126, above.

2 128.

3 County laws and ordinances must be clear, precise, definite and certain in their

4 terms so that their precise meaning can be ascertained. Statutes which either forbid or require the
doing of an act in terms so vague

5 that people of common intelligence must necessarily guess at

6 their meaning and differ as to their application, violate due process of law. Zubarau v. City of

7 Palmdale, 192 Cal.App.4th 289, 308 (2011).

129.

8 The 2040 General Plan and the Zoning Amendments are impermissibly vague

9 because they fail to provide adequate notice to those who must comply with their strictures of

10 what conduct is prohibited and what is allowed. For example, the 2040 General Plan purports to

11 require "discretionary development for oil and gas exploration and production to use

12 electronically-powered equipment from 100 percent renewable sources and cogeneration, where

13 feasible, to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from internal combustion engines

14 and equipment." The term "*discretionary development for oil and gas exploration and

15 production" is vague and uncertain. People of ordinary intelligence will differ as to whether it

16 applies to each and every aspect of Aera's business that relates in any way to oil and gas

17 exploration and production, or some subset of the business that constitutes actual oil and gas

18 exploration, or production, or both. It is also unclear when the use of electronically powered

19 equipment from 100 percent renewable sources is feasible or infeasible, and who makes that

20 determination based on what criteria. A statute is impermissibly vague if it delegates basic policy

M matters to judges and juries for resolution. The 2040 General Plan does sO.

130.
22 The 2040 General Plan also states: "oil and produced water shall not be trucked."

23 24 (COS 7.7). It is unclear whether that constitutes a blanket prohibition against the transportation
of any amount of oil or produced water, for any purpose, via truck throughout the County, or if

25 the transportation of some amount of oil or produced water, for certain purposes, is permitted.

131.

26 Due to the vague and uncertain composition of the Oil and Gas Policies in the

27 2040 General Plan, the County has failed to provide Aera, or the public, with adequate notice of
what conduct is required.
