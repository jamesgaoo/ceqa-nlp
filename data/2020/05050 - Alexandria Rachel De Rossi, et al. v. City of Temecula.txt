8 NEERU SEHGAL: DANNY ABREGO; NICHOLAS ORTEGA (hereinafter "Petitioners").

0 hereby allege:

10 1. Petitioners are individuals who own and/or reside at real property in the City of
11 Temecula, County of Riverside, State of California. Petitioners are representatives of a group of
12 many similarl y-situated property owners and/or residents who comprise an unincorporated

13 association called Citizens of Temecula for Short-Term Rentals. Said real properties have been

14 used for shon-term rental purposes for years.

15 2. Respondent. CITY OF TEMECULA (hereinafter "Respondent"), is the government
16 | agency which made the decisions regarding the Project alleged hereinbelow.

17 3. This Petition for Writ of Mandate is being made pursuant to the California
18 Environmental Quality Act found at Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.

19 4. The subject project is an ordinance with respect 10 short-term rentals of residential
20 housing in the City of Temecula called "Ordinance No. 2020-01" (hercinalter "the Ordinance",

21 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit I). The Ordinance was cnacted by a vote of

22 Respondent's City Council on January 28, 2020. The Notice of Exemption pertaining to the

23 Ordinance (a copy of this Notice of Exemption is attached hereto as Exhibit 2) was issued by
24 Respondent on February 18, 2020, and it was recorded at the Riverside County Recorder on
25 February 28, 2020. Said Notice claims, inter ulia, that Respondent "operates under a permissive

26 zoning code" and thus "any use not enumcrated in the code is presumptively prohibited" under Citv

27 of Corona v. Naulls (2008) 166 Cal.App.4t 418. Section 5 of the Ordinance states in pertinent part:
28 "Short-term rental' shall mcan the rental of a dwelling unit (in whole or in part). accessory

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA â€¢ PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 21000 ET SEQ.}

structurc, and/or a recreational vehicle located upon a parcel or a portion thereof. by owner(s) or
2 lesscc(s) to another person or group of people for occupancy, dwelling, lodging or siecping

3 purposes for a period of less than 30 consecutive calendar days."

4 5. Respondent enacted the Ordinance without performing an Environmental Impact Report
or adopting a Negative Declaration. Instead. Respondent simply recorded the Notice of Exemption.

6 Respondent's actions and inactions with respect to the Ordinance constitute prejudicial abuse of
discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Such actions and
8 inactions failed to cvaluate the Ordinance's significant cnvironmental impact on the area.
9 Furthermore, there was no evaluation of mitigating meusures which could climinate or substantially

10 lessen significant environment impacts of the Ordinance. The Ordinance's overbroad blanket

11 prohibition of short-term rentals, which negatively impacts property values and property owners'
12 rights, is in striking contrast to the Riverside County statute pertaining to short-term rentals
13 (hercinafter "the Riverside statute", a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3). The Riverside

14 statute permits short-term rentals with a number of reasonable restrictions which are listed in detail

15 in Section 8 thereof. Respondent claims to bc completcly exempt from CEQA due to its allegedly
16 "opcrat[ing] under a permissive zoning code." However, if short-term rentals were already banned
17 by Respondent, then the enactment of the Ordinance adds nothing to the law and therefore is in
18 conflict with Civil Code Section 3532, which states: "The law neither does nor requires idle acts."

19 Furthermore, on information and belicf, DO property owner has ever been cited for an allegedly
20 already-illegal short-term rental. Respondent thereby violated its dutics to perform an
21 / Environmental Impact Report or Negative Declaration conforming to the requirements of CEQA
22 and the CEQA Guidelines. In sum, there is a fair and reasonable argument that there is a significant
23 cnvironmental impact due to the Ordinance.

24 6. Petitioners have communicated with Respondent. in writing and orally about the
25 Ordinance on several occasions to no avail. Thercfore, on information and belief, Petitioners have
26 exhausted any administrative remedics they may have had before commencing this action.
27 7, The enactment of the Ordinance has caused a reduction in the value of Petitioners*

28 properties (as well as properties owned by others similarly situated) and thus is a "taking" for the

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA -- PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 21000 ET SEQ.]

purposes of inverse condemnation. The taking occurred when the Ordinance came into effect on
February 27, 2020. The enactment of the Ordinance made citation for a violation thercof an actual

3 threat which could result in a conviction in criminal court with penalties of up to six months in the

4 County Jail and/or a $1,000.00 fine. Petitioners are not now suing for inverse condemnation though
5 that option remains open to them.

6 8. On the basis of the forcgoing, Petitioners seck (a) precmptory writ of mandate directing

7 Respondent to perform an Environmental Impact Report as to short-term rentals generally and the
8 Ordinance specifically as well as (b) injunctive relie restraining Respondent from taking any action

9 to enforce the Ordinance pending trial and after trial (temporary restraining order, preliminary

10 injunction, and permanent injunction).

11 PRAYER

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for entry of judgment as follows:

13 1. a For a preemptory writ of mandate directing Respondent to perform an Environmental
14 Impact Report as to short-term rentals in the City of Temecula generally and the Ordinance
15 specifically.

16 2. For injunctive relief restraining Respondent from taking any action to enforce the
17 Ordinance pending trial and after trial (temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and
18 permanent injunction).

19 3. For an award of attorncy's fecs and costs of suit.

20 4. For any other relief that the Court deems proper and just.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY
OF TEMECULA AMENDING TITLE 17 OF THE
TEMECULA MUNICIPAL CODE TO ADD A DEFINITION
OF SHORT-TERM RENTALS AND ADDING SHORT-TERM
RENTALS TO THE USE REGULATION TABLE, AND
FINDING THAT THIS ORDINANCE IS EXEMPT FROM
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT (CEQA) PURSUANT TO CEQA GUIDELINES SECTION 15061 (B)(3)

THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TEMECULA DOES HEREBY ORDAIN AS
FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Proccdural Findings. The City Council of the City of Temecula does
hereby find. determine and declare that:

A. City staff identified the need to make revisions and clarifications to portions of Title
17 (Zoning) of the Temecula Municipal Code,

B. The Planning Commission considered the proposed amendments (o Title 17 (Zoning) of the Temecula Municipal Code ("Ordinance") on June 5, 2019, at a duly noticed public hearing as preseribed by law, at which time the City staff and interested persons had an opportunity to and did testity either in support of or opposition to this matter.

C At the conclusion of the Planning Commission hearing and after due consideration of the testimony, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. 19-17, recommending that the City Council approve the Title 17 amendments.

D. The City Council, at a regular mecting, considered the Ordinance on January 14, 2020, at a duly noticed public henring, as prescribed by law, at which time the City Staff and interested persons had an opportunity 10 and did testify either in support or opposition to this
matter.

E. Following the public hearing, the City Council considered the cutire record of information received at the public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council.

Section 2. Further Findings. The City Council. in approving the proposed Ordinance, hereby makes the following additional findings as required by Section 17.01.040 (*Relationship to Gencra) Plan") of the Temecula Municipal Code:

l. The proposed usc is allowed in the land use designation in which the use is located. as shown on the land use map, or is described in the text of the general plan.

The proposed amendments to Title 17 of the Temecula Municipal Code do not propose any land use that is inconsistemt with the Temecula Gencral Plan. Short-Ierm rentals are an unpermitted use under the City's permissive zoning code as well as the General Plan's residential use descriptions, The amendments updale Title 17 to include a definition of short-term rentals and to expressly identity short term rentals as an unpermitted use in the City which is consistent with in the Gencral Plan.

2. The proposed usc is in conformmance with the goals, policics, programs and guidclines of the elements of the general plan,
The proposed short-term rental defnition. as well as the amcodment that will further clarify that short-term rentals are an unpermitted use in the in City is consistent with Goal 5 of the Land Use Element of the Temecula General Plan, which is (o ensure "A land use pattern that proteets and enhances residential neighborhoods." The proposed short-term reotal definition. as well us the proposed amendment will expressly identify short-term rentals as an unpermitted use, is consistent with the residential uses description of in the Lund Use Element of the Temecula General Plan. "Residential uses are intended to be the principal and dominant use within cach of the residential designations."

3. "The proposed use is to be established and maintained in a manner which is consistem with the general plan and all applicable provisions contained therein.
The City currently prohibits short term rentals in residential zones because this use is not is
identified as a permitted or conditionally permitted use in the City. The proposed amendment that will 0 add a short-term rental definition, and that will expressly identify short tenn rentuls as a prohibited use in the City is consistent with the Temecula Municipal Code and the adopted General
Plan.

Section 3. Further Findings. The City a operates under a permissive roning code. Temecula Municipal Code Section 17.01.080 provides that "[n]o person shall use any premises except as specifically permitted by and subject to the regulations and conditions of this development code." Under permissive zoning code "any use not enumerated in the code is presumptively prohibited." (City of Corona s. Naulls, 166 Cal.App.4th 418, 425, 433 (2008).) "Where a particular use of land is not expressly enumerated in a city's municipal code as constituting a permissible use, it follows that such use is impermissible." (Id.) The omission of any particular land use from local zoning regulations is the equivalent of an express ban unless 0 designated official finds that the proposed use is substantially the same in character and intensity as those land uses listed in the code. (Wd. at 433-436.) Table 17.06.030 of the Temccula Municipal Code identifles the uses that are specifically permitted in residential districts and under this permissive zoning scheme, iFa use is not listed, it is prohibited. Staff has consistently imterpreted the City's Municipal Code as bunning short tern rentals as this use is not expressly identified as a permitted or conditionally permitted use in Table 17.06.030. Given the recent proliferation of short term rentals that are operating in violation of the Temecula Municipal Code, the Chty Council finds that it is necessary to now expressly prohibit short term rentals. This express prohibition reaffirms the City's longstanding prohibition on short-term rentals.

2

Section 4. Environmental Findings. The City Council hereby Ainds that this Ordinance is exempt from the requirements of the Califomia Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to Title 14 of the Califomia Code of Regulations. Section 15061(b)(3) because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed ordinancc would have : significant impact on the environment pursuant to Stute CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). The proposed Municipal Code amendments clarify that short term rentals ure an unpermitted use in the City (they are already prohibited under the City's permissive zoning). These amendments do not result in any increase in the inteasity or density of any land use above what is currently allowed. A Notice of Exemption has been prepared and will be filed in accordance with CEOA and the State CEQA Guidelines.

Section 5. Section 17.34.010 (Definitions and illustrations of terms.) of Chapter 17.34
(Definitions of Terms) of Title 17 (Zoning) of the Temecula Municipal Code is bereby amended
to read as follows with all other definitions remaining imchanged:

"*Short-term rental" shall mean the renlal of a dwelling unit (in wholc or in part), accessory
structure, and/or a recreational vehicle located upon a parcel or u portion thereof, by owner(s) or
lessee(s) to another person or group of people for occupancy, dwelling, lodging or slecping purposes for a period of less than 30 consecutive culendar days.
A short-term rental includes any contract or agreement that initially defined the rental term to bc greater than 30 consccutive days and which was subsequently amended. either verbally or mn
writing to permit the occupam(s) of the owner(s) or lessee(s) short-tcrm rental to surrender the subject dwelling unit before the expiration of the initial rental tenn that results in an actual rental term of less than 30 consecutive days.
The rental of units within city-approved hotels, motels, bed and break fasts. community care facilities, and social care facilities shall not be considered to be a short-term rental.*

Section 6. Tablc 17.06.030 (Residential Districts) of Section 17.06.030 (Use regulation) of Chapter 17.06 (Residential Districts) of Title 17 (Zoning) of the Temecula Municipal Code is hercby amended as foltows (with additions appcaring in underlined text), with all other provisions of Table 17.06.030 remaining unchanged:

The City Council hercby deelares that it would have adopted this Ordinance,

Statement of Reasons Supparting the Finding that the Project is Exempt: M
The Qily operates under a permissive zoning code. Temecula Municipal Code Section 17.01.000 prowides that oJo parson shad use any premises excopt as spocilicaty permitted by and subjact to the reguetions and conditions of this deveiopment code.' Undor a pormissive zoning code 'any use not enumerated in the code is presumptively prohibked:* (City cf Corona y Nauits, 166 Cal.App.4th 418, 425, 433 (2008).) "Where e particular use of land is nol exprassly enumoratod in a city's municipel code as consiluting e permissibio use, folows that such use : impermissible.* (ld.) The omission of any particular land use from local zoning regulations is the equivalent of an express bon untoss a designated official Ainds that the proposed use is substantialy the same in character and infensly as those land usas listed in the coda. (Id, at 433-436.) Table 17.06.030 of the Temacula Municipal Code identifos the usos that ara speciically peratted in residential districts and undor this permissie zoning schama, N a use is nol listed, # ls prohibited. Staft has consistently interpreted the City's Municipal Codo as banning short term rentals as this use is not exprassty identifed as a pormided or conditionally parmited use Ã  Table 17.00.030. Given the recent proliferation of short term rontals that are operating in wolation of the Temecula Munkcipal Code, the City Council finds that A is necessery to now expressly prohibit short temi rontals. This expross prohibition reallinns the City's longslanding prohibition on shont-tom rentals. The Oity Council hereby linds that this Ordinance is exempt from the requirements of the Catfomia Envronmental Qually Act (*CEQA) pursvant to THle 14 of tha Colifamia Coda of Regulations, Soction 15061(b)(3) because it can be seon with cortainty that there ts no possibbity that the proposed orcinance would bave a significant impact on the environment pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15081(6)(3). The proposed Municipal Code amandmonts clarky that short lem rentais orD an unperitted use in the City (they are atroady prohibited under the Chty's permissive zoning). These smondments do not result in any increase in the or densiy of any land use above what is currenthy allowed.
