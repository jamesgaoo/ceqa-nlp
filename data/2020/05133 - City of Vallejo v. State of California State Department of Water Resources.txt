7 the Yolo Bypass West levee system.
8 Cache/Hass Slough Levee - SPFC levee located on the north side of

9 Cache and Hass Sloughs, which borders the southern boundaries of the
10 Bowlsbey and Liberty Farms Properties. The Cache/Hass Slough Levee is
11 part of the Yolo Bypass West levee system.
12 • Cache/Hass Slough Training Levee - The Proposed Project includes
13 improvements to the stability of the Cache/Hass Slough Levee and the
14 Cross Levee. The improved levee would function to maintain stage
15 differences between the Proposed Project Site and waters in Cache/Hass
16 Slough during bypass flooding events. The Cache/Hass Slough Training
17 Levee refers to the Cache/Hass Slough Levee and the Cross Levee in their
18 modified post-project state and altered function.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 • Duck Slough Man-made drainage/water control channel that forms

2 the western boundary of the Bowlsbey Property. Duck Slough is not
3 connected to Hass Slough and is not open to tidal inundation.
4 Sycamore Slough - Remnant of a historical slough, which is no

5 longer connected to Hass Slough and is not open to tidal inundation.

6 6. The Project would restore approximately 3,164 acres of tidal marsh that would
7 help satisfy DWR's obligations under Reasonable and Prudent Alternative 4 of the 2008 USFWS

8 Delta Smelt Biological Opinion, and is consistent with RPA 1.6.1 of the 2009 NMFS Salmonid
9 Biological Opinion for the coordinated operations of the State Water Project and the Central

10 Valley Project.

11 7. On or about March 21, 2019 DWR issued a notice of preparation of an EIR for
12 the Project.

13 8. On or about December 16, 2019 DWR issued a Notice of Availability to review a

14 draft EIR.

15 9. During the public comment period for the draft EIR Petitioner together with other
16 public agencies and members of the public submitted written comments concerning the draft

17 EIR. Petitioner commented that the EIR lacked reference to the Petitioner's Cash Slough PP and

18 was not analyzed under the draft EIR, the model output analysis was incorrect, that the
19|| Petitioner's Cash Slough PP should be specifically included in the hydraulic modeling analysis,

20 that the modeling showed that the project precursors to disinfectant by-products would

21 significantly increase the Petitioner's treatment and monitoring costs, and that the EIR failed to

22 indicate if future biological activity could hamper Petitioner's ability to pup water.

23 10. On or about October 2020 the DWR released a final EIR consisting of 912 pages,

24 including numerous additions, revisions and deletions of important text from the draft EIR,

25 considerable revisions to the mitigation measures presented in the draft EIR while also adding

26 new mitigation measures and deleting existing mitigation measures. This final EIR was not

27 subject to recirculation for public comments about these numerous changes. To put the size of

28 this final EIR and the magnitude of the numerous changes to the draft EIR into an

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 understandable context, CEQA Guideline section 15140 explains that a draft EIR should not
2 exceed one hundred and fifty pages, except for exceptional situations. Accordingly, this final
3 EIR is more than six times larger than a typical draft EIR.
4 11. On or about November 2, 2020 DWR certified the EIR and approved the Project.
5 12. On or about November 3, 2020, the DWR posted a Notice of Determination
6 regarding the EIR.

7 13. The Project is discretionary in nature, requiring mandatory substantive findings.
8 The decision-makers were required to exercise judgment and deliberation in determining
9 whether and how to approve the Project.
10 14. The DWR was presented with substantial evidence that the Project would result in
11 significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated in the EIR.
12 15. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the Project.
13 Petitioner's representatives and other members of the public objected orally and in writing, and
14 presented evidence that the Project has the potential to cause significant environmental impacts,
15 and that the environmental review considered for the Project does not satisfy the minimum
16 requirements of CEQA.

17 16. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the DWR's full compliance with
18 CEQA, State Planning and Zoning law (in particular the Solano County General Plan), the
19 Williamson Act and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.
20 17. DWR has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, State Planning and
21 Zoning Law (particularly the Solano County General Plan), the Williamson Act and all other
22 applicable laws when approving the Project.
23 18. Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.
24 19. Petitioner will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmental
25 impacts that may result from the Project.
26 20. Petitioner has standing to bring this action and seek to compel a public duty in the
27 form of Respondent complying with State and local land use and environmental laws.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H 21.

2 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code §21167.5 by
mailing written notice of this action to DWR.

22. Petitioner has complied with Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc.

5 §388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.
23.

6 Petitioner has a right to enforce DWR's mandatory duties under State and local
law related to the Project.

7 24. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or

8 course of law. adequate remedy in the ordinary

9 25. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and
10 Petitioner by Respondent fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law prior to
11 certifying the EIR and approving the Project. A clear and significant benefit will be
12 independently conferred upon the general public by the Respondent fully satisfying the
13

14 requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law (in particular the Solano County General

15 Plan), and the Williamson Act. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement

16 of a mandatory duty. The public, of which Petitioner is a member is vitally and beneficially

17 interested in assuring the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief

18 requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that
fundamental rules of law would be affected.

19 26.

20 By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

21 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ

22 of Mandate and other appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to set aside the DWR approval
of the Project and certification of the EIR.

23 27. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
24 arose in Solano County where both the Project Site and Petitioner are located.
25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
26

27 Violation of CEQA: DWR Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion and Did Not Comply with the Vital Public Involvement Objective of CEQA by Failing to Provide A

28 Meaningful Public Comment Period as Required by CEQA Concerning the Evaluation and Mitigation of Environmental Impacts. Impacts; Unstable Project Description.

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H 28.

2 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
in Paragraphs 1 through 27.

3 29. CEQA Guideline section 15201 reads in part:

4

5 Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. Each public agency should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public

6 involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

7 environmental issues related to the agency's activities.

8

9 Public Resources Code section 2100(e) states that "[e]very citizen has a responsibility
I to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment." Furthermore, if the
10  deficiencies in an EIR "preclude[] informed decision-making and public participation, the

11

12 goals of CEQA are thwarted and a prejudicial abuse of discretion has occurred." Bakersfeld

13 Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal. App. 4th 1184, 1220.

30.

14 In this instance Petitioner, other public agencies, and other members of the public,

15 submitted comments about the draft EIR during the designated public comment period.

16 However, the quantity and quality of changes to the draft EIR as part of the final EIR process

17 nullified the statutory purposes and objectives of a public comment period. Due to the wholesale

18 changes to the draft EIR incorporated by the final EIR process, the public was deprived of a

19 meaningful opportunity to comment on the substantially revised EIR actually certified by DWR.

20 Stated slightly differently, the final EIR certified by the DWR is substantially different than the

21 draft EIR subject to public review and comment by Petitioner and other members of the public.
31.

22 For purposes of illustration, more specifically the final EIR changes the text of the

23 draft EIR over at least fifty-three pages, with some pages experiencing multiple changes. The

24 changed pages include: II-22, II-23, II-24, II-25, 2 II-6, II-27, II-28, II-29 II-30, II-31, I1- 34, II-

25 35, II-38, II-43; III-6, III-34, III-35, III-39; IVA- 8, IVA-19, IVB- 6, IVB- 12, IVC-13, IV D- 43,

1 32. For purposes of illustration in addition, the final adopted EIR significantly

2 changed at least thirty-nine mitigation measures. Many mitigation measures presented in the

3 draft EIR experienced multiple changes, and entirely new mitigation measures were added. The

4 changed mitigation measures include for the topic of Biology alone included: Mitigation

5 Measures BIO-2 7) BIO-2 8) BIO- 9) BIO- 10); BIO-4 2) BIO-4 3) BIO-4 4); BIO-5A 2) and

10 enumerated in this section, this significant changes to mitigation measures was also true for other

11 environmental topics addressed in the draft EIR.

12 33. For illustration purposes only, the following additions and deletions to a

13 mitigation measure presented in the Air Pollution topical section of the draft EIR illuminates the

14 quality and magnitude of changes made during the final EIR process, changes that were not
15 subject to public comment and review:

11 For purposes of this mitigation measure, "commercially available" shall
mean the availability of Tier 4 Final engines similar to the availability for

3 34. In addition, the final EIR included an Appendix X, entitled "Resource 4
Management Associates Lookout Slough Tidal Habitat Restoration and Flood Improvement 5 Project Modeling", dated July 2020 that was not included nor discussed in the Draft EIR. This 6 Appendix includes approximately Five Hundred and One pages: 148 pages of new narrative text, 7 7 pages of new modeling boundaries, 4 pages of new water quality modeling calibrations, 166 8
new figures taking up 216 pages, and 13 new tables taking up 125 pages. None of this extensive
9 data text or modeling was provided for or subject to public comment. 10
35. As an integrated part of these enormous draft EIR changes, the final EIR changed 11
or revised at least thirty-nine Biology mitigation measure that had previously been reviewed 12 during the public review period, adding at least fifteen entirely new mitigation measures after the 13 public review period concluded, deleting at least five mitigation measures that had been 14 presented in the draft EIR and subject to comment by the public, and provided approximately 15
148 pages of new modeling narrative, approximately 11 pages of new modeling boundaries and 16 calibrations, approximately 216 pages of new figures and approximately 125 pages of new 17 tables. All of these events occurred after the public comment period concluded and, therefore, 18 were not subject to public scrutiny and formal public comment. 19
36. None of the changes referenced in Paragraphs 34 and 35 above and other changes 20 generally, but not specifically referenced, were subject to a noticed public comment period. The 21 quality and quantity of changes and revisions to the draft EIR preempted the effectiveness of the 22 designated public comment period, rendering the comment period a nullity in relationship to the 23 EIR that DWR actually certified. Vast portions of the EIR certified by DWR were never subject 24 to a public comment review as contemplated and required by CEQA. 25
37. The conclusion presented in the final EIR that these changes were not substantial 26 or significant is without substantial evidence, and was not tested through a noticed or formal 27 public comment period.
28

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 38. The revisions to, deletions and additions of mitigation measures constitutes a new

2 Project Description which was never subject to public review. Without a stable and finite Project
3 description an EIR cannot fulfill the statutory duty to provide information and data about the
4 significance of potential environmental effects that may be caused by a project.
5 39. Wholesale changes to the draft EIR, as identified in Paragraphs 34 and 35 renders
6 the draft EIR public comment period ineffective and not compliant with CEQA's requirement for
7 public comment. DWR's action of certifying the EIR under these circumstances constitutes a
failure to a proceed in a manner required by law.

12 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
13 in Paragraphs 1 through 39.
14 41. Public Resources Code section 15088.5 compels a public agency to recirculate an
15 environmental impact report in certain instances. Public Resources Code section 15088.5(a)(1)-
16 (4).

17 42. The final EIR for the Project was changed so significantly that it did not even
18 resemble the Draft EIR; such changes included:
19 A. changes to one or more portions of text from at least fifty-three pages of the
20 draft EIR,
21 B. Revisions to at least 39 Biological mitigation measure and other mitigation
22 measures concerning other environmental topics,
23 C. The additional of at least fifteen entirely new Biological mitigation measures
24 and other mitigation measures concerning other environmental topics,
25 D. The deletion of at least five mitigation measures,
26 E. Inclusion of approximately 148 pages of new modeling narrative,
27 F. Inclusion of approximately 11 pages of new modeling boundaries and
28 calibrations,

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 G. Inclusion of approximately 216 pages of new figures, and
2 H. The addition of approximately 125 pages of new tables.

3 All of these extensive changes occurred after the public comment period concluded, and,
4 therefore, were not subject to public scrutiny and formal public comment.

5 43. The magnitude, quality and quantity of the changes to the draft EIR demonstrate
6 that it was a fundamentally and basically inadequate document for purposes of satisfying CEQA.
7 Over 900 pages of text, figures and tables were required to be added to the draft EIR after the
8 public agency received comments from the public and affected public agencies in an attempt to
9 address the inadequacies disclosed by the comments.

10 44. In addition, the wholesale changes to the draft EIR rendered public comments
11 virtually meaningless. The public was deprived of an opportunity to comment on more than fifty-
12 three pages of the draft EIR, 39 different biological mitigation measures including the inclusion
13 of fifteen new Biological measures and the deletion of at least five Biological measure (together
14 with additions, deletions and revisions to numerous mitigation measures concerning other
15 environmental topics), 148 pages of new modeling narrative and hundreds of pages of new
16 figures and tables. The public never had the opportunity to comment on vast portions of the EIR
17 that were deficient during the public comment but which DWR attempted to cure after the public
18 comment period lapsed.

19 45. Under these circumstances certifying the EIR by dispensing with the recirculation
20 process was an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.

21 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

22 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate
23 the Impacts to Municipal Water Operations

24 46. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
25 in Paragraphs 1 through 45.

26 47. Petitioner is a party to a legally binding contract with DWR to receive water from
27 the State Water Project from the NBA, diverted from the area where the proposed Project would
28 be located. The draft EIR's discussion concerning water quality does not constitute a reasonable,

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- good faith disclosure and analysis, and the presentation of facts and information as required by
2 CEQA. Changes in salinity and bromide will impact Petitioner's operations concerning cost,
3 quality, ability to treat, and quantity of water available to divert, of the municipal drinking water
4 supply. The draft EIR's conclusion that the impact to Petitioner's water supplies are less than
5 significant is not supported by the data, modeling or analysis.

6 48. The Project also proposes to make significant modifications to the flood storage
7 capacity of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Unit 109, which could result in the permanent loss of
8 40,000 acre-feet of storage. (DEIR, p. II-39.) The DEIR does not propose solutions to replace the
9 potential loss of Unit 109 storage potential, nor does it propose mitigation for the removal of a
10 potential 40,000 acre-foot loss of storage. This represents a permanent and irreversible
11 modification in the Unit 109 operation, performance and level of flood protection afforded Unit
12 109. This is a significant impact, but is not disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in the DEIR.
13 Water Quality re Salinity and Bromide.

14 49. In its February 14, 2020 letter commenting on the draft EIR, Petitioner
15 underscored the draft EIR's failure to evaluate the impact of salinity and bromide on municipal
16 water and municipal water intake operations. Petitioner wrote:
17 The City concurs with the opinion and concerns expressed in the SCWA- authored regional letter, dated February 13, 2020, as well as SCWA's 18 individual letter, dated February 14, 2020. The NBA water source
19 provides a constant high quality source water, allowing the City of Vallejo to have reduced monitoring requirements for organic carbon, total 20 trihalomethane (TTHMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and bromate/bromide.
21 The Draft EIR currently indicates there are no direct project impacts to the Barker Slough pumping plant (the current intake of Vallejo's NBA water,
22 but the DEIR needs to study indirect impacts to source water treatability.

23 The City lacks confidence in the assertion of no direct impacts with the
24 model in its current state. Any small impact to Barker Slough's water quality resulting in a small increase in organics or bromide, would cause
25 huge impacts to Vallejo's water quality and treatability. Of largest concern is the potential increase in disinfection by products (DBPs) if increased 26 ozone and chlorine is required to treat source waters. Therefore, any small
27 change in water quality (organics or bromide) may lead to Vallejo losing their reduced monitoring status, and result significant financial impact to 28 the City. Such changes would also lead to higher chemical usage, which would also increase costs, and could have further negative effects on the

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

water quality of Vallejo's treated water. There are many other possible
2 effects that are not yet determined.

3 50. The DEIR evaluates the Project's impacts on salinity using results from a

4 simulation for 2009, but the selection of a single a year does not account for uncertainties and

5 variations found in the hydrologic conditions in the Delta. (DEIR, p. IV.G-22.) The standard

6 technical analyses for CALFED storage projects involve longer simulation period (either 1922-

7 2003 or 1976-1991) that covers a wide variety of hydrological conditions to evaluate the
8 potential consequences of a project that would change Delta hydrodynamics. Specifically, these

9 longer simulation periods include droughts and wet-year periods of varying magnitude and

10 length to better demonstrate existing conditions in the Delta. A proper impact analysis requires a

11 longer simulation of the project under varying hydrologic conditions to better understand how

12 the Project will impact salinity over time.

13 51. The DEIR's evaluation of the Project's impacts on salinity for drinking water

14 purposes is legally defective. The draft EIR's analysis fails to demonstrate whether the Project

15 would adversely impact drinking water standards due to different salinity impacts. The drinking
16 water salinity impact discussion is conclusory, and does not refer to supporting information or

17 reports in a way that facilitates a reader locating this information. CEQA requires that relevant

18 information related to potential impacts on the environment be presented in the EIR itself, not

19 hidden away in an appendix or report, in order to fulfill the goals a of CEQA as a means of agency

20 accountability.

21 Organic Carbon.

22 53. In the Solano County Water Agency's (SCWA) February 13, 2020 letter
23 commenting on the draft EIR, SCWA noted that the draft EIR failed to evaluate the
24 impact of the potential for increased organic carbon from the Project to adversely impact
25 municipal water quality. Petitioner wrote:

26 the DEIR does not include any discussion or analysis of Organic
27 Carbon. While Organic Carbon may have ecological benefits, it can also have significant impacts on municipal water quality. In the drinking water
28 treatment process, Organic Carbon can react with Chlorine to form a variety of Disinfection Byproducts including Trihalomethanes (THMs)

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and Haloacetic Acids (HAAs) which are carcinogenic and harmful to
2 human health. The NBA water purveyors are highly sensitive to Organic Carbon levels, as users will often need to blend or switch water sources (if
3 possible), or aggressively treat NBA source water to maintain safe high- quality municipal drinking water standards. Additionally, the NBA 4 currently experiences the poorest water quality throughout the entire SWP
5 in regards to Total Organic Carbon (TOC) levels, as illustrated by Figure 1. Major land use changes such as Lookout Slough, have the potential to
6 export Organic Carbon and/or modify hydrodynamic process that may further degrade NBA municipal water quality. 7

8 54. In its response to comments, DWR states: "[t]he Draft EIR did not include an

9 analysis of the Proposed Project effect on TOC because there is no regulatory standard to form a

10 significant threshold to determine effects on TOC levels". However, the obligation to prepare

11 good faith responses to comments to an environmental impact is not dispensed with in instances

12 where no regulatory standard to form a threshold of significance for the identified impact.

13 Furthermore, DWR did not explain why the absence of a regulatory threshold of significance

14 precluded DWR from preparing a good faith response to the comment or alternatively

15 formulating a non-regulatory created threshold of significance for this situation. This is

16 inconsistent with the fact that CALFED agencies, of which DWR is a member, adopted its own

17 TOC water quality target in its August 2000 Record of Decision as follows:

18 CALFED Agencies' target for providing safe, reliable, and affordable drinking water in a cost-effective way, is to achieve either: (a) average
19 concentrations at Clifton Court Forebay and other southern and central

20 Delta drinking water intakes of 50 ug/L bromide and 3.0 mg/L total organic carbon, or (b) an equivalent level of public health protection using
21 a cost effective combination of alternative source waters, source control and treatment technologies.
22 https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=5075

23 Hydrodynamic Changes
24

25 55. SCWA also commented that the draft EIR omitted significant municipal water

26 intakes and the potential hydrodynamic changes caused by the Project:

27 In addition, the DEIR does not discuss the importance and sensitivity of Contra Costa Water District's (CCWD's) four municipal intakes located at
28 Mallard Slough, Rock Slough, Old River and Victoria Canal which can be highly influenced by hydrodynamic changes in the Delta and Suisun

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Marsh. In addition, it should be noted that CCWD provides municipal
2 water to over 500,000 residents in Contra Costa County and the NBA to 500,000 residents in Napa and Solano Counties. The City of Vallejo also
3 has water rights that predate the State Water Project (SWP) on Cache Slough, and provides municipal drinking water to over 120,000 residents 4 within the City as well as Travis Air Force Base.

5 56. This omission results in omitting and overlooking potential impacts, relevant data
6 and information, and resulted in a defective evaluation of a significant environmental impact.
7 Certifying the EIR amounts to a failure to a proceed in a manner required by law.
8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
9

10 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts to Agriculture.

11 57. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

12 in Paragraphs 1 through 56.

13 58. Water quality and water level impacts resulting from the Project may reduce the

14 ability of existing agricultural water diverters to meet the water needs of their agricultural crops.

15 This in turn could suppress food production, or cause some acreage to be fallowed. The potential

16 impacts to agriculture from changed operations at water intakes constitute a directly foreseeable

17 impact on the physical environment due to the Project; however, these impacts were not studied

18 in the EIR.

19 59. The Project directly converts significant land currently in agricultural production

20 to non-agricultural uses. Contrary to the undocumented conclusion in the draft EIR, agricultural

21 conservation easements do not lessen the significance of the loss of agricultural land. Instead

22 conservation casements are not valid mitigation for the loss of agricultural land because such

23 easements in no way offset the actual loss of agricultural land involved in a project, but instead

24 merely prevent other agricultural land in the region from also being developed. The draft EIR

25 contains no evidence demonstrating that conservation easements mitigate the impact of the loss

26 of this farmland. The failure of this measure to mitigate the impact of removing these lands from

27 agricultural production results in the impact remaining significant and unavoidable. DWR, in this

28 instance, failed to make the required Statement of Overriding Consideration.

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 60. A deficient analysis of the potential loss of agricultural land or threatened
2 reduction in the productivity of agricultural land rendered the EIR legally insufficient and it was
3 an abuse of discretion for DWR to certify the EIR. In addition, the agricultural conservation
4 easement mitigation measure does not lessen the impact from the loss of agricultural land and the
5 imposition of this mitigation measure was an abuse of discretion.

6 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 The EIR Did Not Sufficiently Evaluate and Mitigate the Impacts Of
8 The Increase of Endangered Species Intended To Be Created By

9 The Project on Agricultural and Municipal Water Users.

10 61. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

11 in Paragraphs 1 through 60.

12 62. SCWA's comments on the DEIR noted a complete failure to evaluate the impacts

13 of the increased endangered species intended to be created from the Project on both agricultural

14 and municipal users:

15 the DEIR and Appendices do not include any analysis, assessment, potential impacts, or recommended solutions to minimize impacts to
16 existing agricultural and municipal users in the Delta and specifically

17 within the [Cache Slough Complex]CSC. Within the CSC, several public agencies including SCWA and Napa County Flood Control and Water
18 Conservation District (via the NBA), City of Vallejo, and Reclamation District 2068 have major diversion facilities, as well as numerous private
19 agricultural intakes. as part of Appendix E (Good Neighbor

20 Checklist), DWR has not adequately addressed one of the key elements, which is ".are species on the project site expected to increase markedly
21 in abundance and move from the site to neighboring lands or waterways?"

22 63. DWR'S response addressed only agricultural diversions; and that response is
23 inadequate, stating only:

24 Agricultural diversions in the region of the Proposed Project are currently

25 located in critical habitat for several listed fish species, and thus they are already subject to compliance with the state and federal endangered
26 species acts. Therefore, the potential outcome of increased numbers of listed fish species is not an adverse environmental effect of the Proposed 27 Project that must be analyzed and mitigated by DWR in the EIR.

28

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The response is nonsensical; the presence of listed and endangered species at the location of
2 agricultural diversions makes diversion difficult or impossible. The Project is intended to
3 increase the population of listed and endangered species; therefore, the Project will adversely
4 impact the ability of agricultural water users to divert water in the location of the Project. This
adverse impact was ignored in the DEIR, and summary dismissed in the FEIR.

6 64. The DEIR did not discuss how the Project's intended consequence of increasing
7 the numbers of listed and endangered species would adversely impact the ability of municipal
8 water users to divert. Despite Petitioner's comments pointing out this deficiency, DWR did not
respond to these comments, or evaluate the potential impact.
10 65. At the NBA, the location at which water is diverted to Petitioners and others to

11 serve a population of over 500,000 people in Napa and Solano County, DWR's operations are
12 governed by a 2019 USFWS Biological Opinion and March 2020 Incidental 'Take Permit that
13 imposes restrictions on the amount of water that can be pumped in relation to the number of delta
14 smelt present. For example, the Incidental Take Permit provides:
15 From March through June 30 of dry and critical water years, Permittee
16 shall reduce maximum seven-day average diversion rate at BSPP [Barker Slough Pumping Plant] to less than 60 cfs when larval DS [Delta Smelt]
17 are detected In addition, in its weekly meetings from March

18 through June 30, the Smelt Monitoring Team shall review DS abundance and distribution survey data and other pertinent abiotic and biotic factors
19 that influence the entrainment risk of larval DS at the BSPP (including

20 temperature and turbidity). When recommended by the Smelt Monitoring Team, and as approved through the decision-making processes described
21 in Conditions of Approval 8.1.3 and 8.1.4, Permittee shall reduce the maximum seven-day average diversion rate at BSPP to less than 60 cfs.
22 https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-Pages/Programs/State-Water-Project/Files/ITP- 23

24 for-Long-Term-SWP-Operations.pdf, and the 2019 Biological Opinion provides: A cumulative

25 total of no more than 30,000 acre feet of water will be diverted through the NBA diversions

26 during the months of March, April, and May. https://www.fws.gov/sfbaydelta/cvp-
swp/documents/10182019_ROC_BO_final.pdf
27

28 Therefore, the increase in delta smelt present in the Cache Slough complex that is a direct
and intended result of the Project would have a direct adverse impact on the ability of Petitioner

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to receive water from the NBA, and to meet their water demands from the NBA, by reducing the
2 quantity of water that can be diverted.

3 66. The failure to prepare a good faith response to the comment constitutes an abuse of
4 discretion and a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.

5 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violation of Duty - Study Inconsistency with Plans
7 67. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

8 in Paragraphs 1 through 66.

9 68. CEQA Guideline section 15125(d) requires a legally sufficient EIR to "discuss
10 any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans, specific plans
11 and regional plans."

12 69. The draft EIR did not evaluate and analyze the conflicts between the uses
13 proposed by the Project and the Solano County General Plan.
14 70. A general plan is the "constitution" for long term planning in the area and the
15 general plan sits atop the land use hierarchy of land use regulations.
16 71. The uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano General Plan. The
17 General Plan land use designation for the property subject to this Project is "Agriculture". The
18 uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano County General Plan. A general plan
19 divides a jurisdiction into designated land use areas and generally assigns land uses to each
20 designation subject to implementation by a subordinate zoning classification that shall be
21 consistent with the general plan.
22 72. The Solano General Plan explains that the Agriculture General Plan Designation
23 provides:

24 Areas for the practice of agriculture as the primary use, including areas
25 that contribute significantly to the local agricultural economy, and allows for secondary uses that support the economic viability of agriculture.
26 Solano General Plan at LU-19.
27

28 73. Furthermore, while the General Plan Agriculture Designation recognizes natural
resource uses, adopting such natural resources within land designated as Agriculture requires

20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 such uses to maintain "the validity of underlying land use designations." Solano General Plan at
2 LU-25.

3 74. The Project:

4 A. does not present "the practice of agriculture as the primary use";
5 B. does not "support the economic viability of agriculture"; and
6 C. does not maintain "the validity of the underlying land use designation".
7 75. The draft EIR did not acknowledge or evaluate these inconsistencies, thereby
8 rendering the draft EIR legally deficient.

9 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA: Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Mitigate Energy Impacts
11
76.
12 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
in Paragraphs 1 through 75. 13
77.
14 CEQA Guidelines Appendix F states that CEQA "requires that EIRs include a

15 discussion of the potential energy impacts of proposed projects." Appendix F contains detailed

16 specific items that must be included in a legally sufficient analysis of energy impacts by an

17 environmental impact report.

78.
18 The EIR does not disclose the extent to which the Project will create energy
impacts. See draft EIR at pp.11-114.
19
79. The EIR did not discuss
20 any means or methods of avoiding or reducing

21 inefficient, wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy from this Project as required by
Appendix F.
22
80.
23 The EIR failed to satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA Guidelines

24 Appendix F, CEQA Guidelines §15126.4(a)(1), and Pub.Res.C. §21100(b)(3).
81.
25 An environmental impact report cannot dispense with needed analysis by

26 concluding a project complies with Title 24 or other general standards. "Although the Building

27 Code addresses energy savings for components of new commercial construction, it does not

28 address many of the considerations required under appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. These
considerations include whether a building should be constructed at all, how large it should be,

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 where it should be located, whether it should incorporate renewable energy resources, or

2 anything else external to the building's envelope....[C]ompl[ing] with the Building Code does
3 not, by itself, constitute an adequate assessment of mitigation measures that can be taken to

4 address the energy impacts during construction and operation of the project." California Clean

5 Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App. 4th 173 211. Thus applying Title

6 24 is insufficient to assess the effect and mitigation measures.

7 82. The Appendix F CEQA mandate is implemented by instructing public agencies:
8 "[p]otentially significant energy implications of a project should be considered in an EIR," and

( describing several energy-related issues to be evaluated such as energy efficiency, effects to
10 energy supplies, effects on peak and base period demands, compliance with existing energy
11 standards, and transportation energy consumption. Id. at (II)(C). Appendix F explains that
12 compliance starts with the EIR's project description. To produce a legally sufficient analysis, the
13 Guidelines direct an EIR's project description to include a discussion of:
14 • energy consuming equipment to be used by the project (App. F II.A.1.);
15 • energy requirements of the project by fuel type (App. F II.A.2.);
16 •0 energy conservation equipment (App. F IL.A.3.);
17 , energy costs (App F. Il.A.4.); and

18 energy consumption per vehicle trip (App F. II.A.5.).
19 Likewise, Appendix F suggests an EIR's "environmental setting" section "include existing
20 energy supplies and energy use patterns in the region and locality."
21 83. The DEIR omits any discussion of energy consuming equipment to be used by the
22 Project, energy requirements of the Project by fuel type, energy conservation equipment, energy
23 costs, or energy consumption per vehicle trip in the "Project Description" section as required by
24 the Guidelines. Further, the environmental setting fails to disclose existing energy supply and
25 use patterns in Solano County or the surrounding region. Moreover, the DEIR omits the baseline
26  information listed in Appendix F.
27

28

22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 84. The DWR prejudicially abused its discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction
2 by certifying the EIR without first analyzing and/or mitigating the energy impacts of the Project
3 as required by CEQA.

4 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of the Williamson Act

6 85. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
7 in Paragraphs 1 through 84.
8 86. The Williamson Act authorizes counties to a adopt a program whereby landowners

9 voluntarily restrict the possible uses of real property in exchange for more favorable methods of
10 calculating real property tax rates. Solano County has entered into the Williamson Act program
11 and the Project is located on a substantial amount of real property subject to enforceable
12 Williamson Act contacts. Three properties involved in the Project are bound by enforceable
13 Williamson Act contracts: Bowlsbey, Liberty Farms and Vogel.
14 87. The proposed Project uses conflict with the permitted and consistent uses as
15 defined by the Williamson Act and local Williamson Act guidelines.
16 88. The Solano County Williamson Act guidelines define open space use as "the use
17 or maintenance of land in such a manner as to preserve its natural characteristics, beauty, or
18 openness for the benefit and enjoyment of the public, to provide essential habitat for wildlife, or
19 for the solar evaporation of sea water in the course of salt production for commercial purposes".
20 89. The Project does not:

21 A. "preserve the natural characteristics" of the real property; and/or,
22 B. "provide for the enjoyment of the public".

23 90. The Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program designates almost the entire
24 Bowlsbey property as prime farmland.

25 91. Table A of the Solano Guidelines indicate that no habitat land use-namely
26 management of wetlands and restoration of tidal managed and seasonal wetlands using approve
27 dredge sediments-are permitted on prime farmlands under contract.
28

23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 92. Proceeding with project located on land restricted by an enforceable Williamson
2 Act contract when some of the project uses conflict with the permitted and consistent uses

3 according to the Williamson Act constitutes prejudicial failure to proceed in a manner required
4 by law. DWR should be enjoined from using the real property in a manner inconsistent with the
5 restrictions imposed by the Williamson Act.

6 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 The Project is inconsistent with the Solano General Plan

8 93. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
9 In Paragraphs 1 through 92.
10 94. A general plan operates as a "constitution" for long term planning in the area and
11 sits atop the land use hierarchy of land use regulations.
12 95. The uses proposed by this Project are subject to the Solano County General Plan.
13 The Solano County General Plan land use designation for the property subject to this Project is
14 "Agriculture". A general plan divides a jurisdiction into designated land use areas and generally
15 assigns land uses to each designation subject to implementation by a subordinate zoning
16 classification that shall be consistent with the general plan.
17 96. The Solano County General Plan explains that the Agriculture General Plan
18 Designation provides:

19 Areas for the practice of agriculture as the primary use, including areas
20 that contribute significantly to the local agricultural economy, and allows for secondary uses that support the economic viability of agriculture.
21 Solano General Plan at LU-19.
22

23 97. Furthermore, while the General Plan Agriculture Designation recognizes natural

24 resource uses, adopting such natural resources within land designated as Agriculture requires

25 such uses to maintain "the validity of underlying land use designations." Solano General Plan at

26 LU-25.

27 98. The Project:

28 A. does not present "the practice of agriculture as the primary use"; or
B. does not "support the economic viability of agriculture"; or

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. does not maintain "the validity of the underlying land use designation".

2 99. Proceeding with a project located on land restricted by the Solano County General
Plan when some project uses are not permitted under the Agricultural Designation of the General

4 Plan constitutes a prejudicial failure to proceed in a manner required by law. DWR should be
5 enjoined from using the real property in a manner inconsistent with the uses permitted by the

6 Solano County General Plan Agriculture Designation.
