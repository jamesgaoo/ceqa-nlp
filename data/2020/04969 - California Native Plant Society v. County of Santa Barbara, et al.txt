I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner California Native Plant Society ("Petitioner") challenges Respondent County of

3 Santa Barbara's ("Respondent") approval on January 28, 2020 of the Strauss Wind Energy Project

4 ("SWEP" or "Project") and accompanying certification of the Supplemental Environmental

5 Impact Report ("SEIR") as being in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

6 ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. and Fish and Game Code § 3511.

7 2. The Project will eliminate occupied and critical habitat for the Gaviota Tarplant

8 ("Tarplant"), a state and federally listed plant species endemic to Santa Barbara County, with only

9 seven known populations. The Project proposes the construction of massive wind turbine

10 generators (*WTGs') along with platforms, roads and accompanying infrastructure in the middle

11 of the most critical Tranquillion Mountain/Sudden Peak ("Sudden Peak") Tarplant population,

12 thereby directly killing over one million individual Tarplants, along with the associated habitat.

13 The Project will also fragment and isolate remaining Tarplant ocourrences in the Project area, with

14 direct and indirect impacts estimated at over 80% of the Sudden Peak population.

15 3. Despite these substantial effects, the SEIR incorrectly identifies the impacts of the Project

16 as insignificant, based on mitigation measures that propose to recreate Tarplant populations at

17 other areas both within and outside of the Project area. As identified by the California

18 Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW"), such a mitigation approach has never been previously

19 successful. Moreover, the SEIR relies on the future completion of a Tarplant mitigation plan,

20 which is to provide details and specific standards for how mitigation will be successfully

21 accomplished. However, the mitigation plan was never disclosed by Respondent during the

22 CEQA review of the Project, and thus Petitioner and the public were never provided the

23 opportunity to review and provide comments as required by CEQA. By failing to identify that the

24 direct and indirect impacts of the Project will be significant, the SEIR also fails to consider any

25 Project alternatives that would reduce Project impacts on the Tarplant, also contrary to CEQA.

26 4. The Project area also is a known habitat used by nesting pairs of golden eagles, a fully

27 protected species under California law, Fish & Game Code § 3511. Golden eagles, which have

28 been documented flying on a consistent basis through the Project site, will be harmed by the 30

Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 large WTGs planned for the Project, which will range from 427 feet to 492 feet in height, each

2 with three rotating blades up to 225 feet in length. The SEIR determines that golden eagles are

3 expected to be killed by the Project's WTGs and thus adopts as mitigation measure that the

4 Project applicant obtain a 'take' permit from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. However, the

5 SEIR still finds that impacts to golden eagles will be significant and unavoidable. These

6 determinations and findings violate CEQA, as well as Fish and Game Code § 3511, which does

7 not allow 'take' of a fully protected species or allow such 'take' as CEQA mitigation.

8 5. Petitioner seeks writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside its Project approval

9 and SEIR until such time as it has complied with CEQA and the Fish and Game Code.

10 II. PARTIES

11 6. Petitioner California Native Plant Society ("CNPS") is a California non-profit 501(c)(3)

12 corporation whose principle place of business is 2707 K Street, Suite 1, Sacramento, California.

13 Petitioner is a state wide nonprofit organization of over 10,000 members, both professional botanists

14 and laypersons, dedicated to the preservation of California's rich native botanical heritage. The

15 mission of the California Native Plant Society is to increase the understanding and appreciation of

16 California's native plants and to preserve them in their natural habitat through scientific activities,

17 education, and conservation. CNPS members work closely with State and Federal agencies to

18 manage and conserve botanical resources. CNPS is particularly concerned with the conservation of

19 California's rare and endemic plant species and threatened plant communities. CNPS members are

20 engaged in the study, protection, enhancement, conservation and preservation of rare and endangered

21 plants in their natural habitat in California and in Santa Barbara County.

22 7. Respondent County of Santa Barbara is a local agency located in Santa Barbara California and

23 is the CEQA lead agency with respect to approving the Project.

24 8. Real party in interest Strauss Wind LLC is a California corporation with its principal office
25 in San Diego California. Strauss Wind LLC is listed as the Project applicant on the Notice of
26 Determination for the Project filed by the County on January 29, 2020.
27 9. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of DOES 1 through

28 100, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sue said real parties in interest by such fictitious names

1 and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandate when they have been ascertained.

2 HI. JURISDICTION AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

3 10. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §1084

4 et seq. and California Public Resources Code §§ 21168 and/or 21168.5.

5 11. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has

6 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioner

7 provided written comments to Respondent during the administrative process that objected to the

8 Project. Petitioner and other public commenters raised each of the claims raised in this Petition.

9 12. On February 27,2020, Petitioner's attorney faxed a Notice of Commencement of Action letter

10 pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.5 to Respondent informing Respondent of Petitioner's

11 intent to file a legal action in this case challenging the Respondent's approval of the Project. (See

12 Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)

13 13. On February 28, 2020, Petitioner's attorney served a copy of Petitioner's Verified Petition on

14 the Attorney General to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney

15 general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)

16 14. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy in the course of law unless this Court grants the

17 requested writ of mandate.

18 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

19 A. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

20 15. The Project is proposed to be located near the City of Lompoc in the unincorporated territory

21 of Santa Barbara County, The Project site is located on 22 privately owned parcels, comprising

22 approximately 5,887 acres of primarily rural land within the ridges of the Santa Ynez Mountains,

23 along San Miguelito Canyon, and the White Hills. The Project site is just over two miles inland from

24 the Gaviota Coast, a 76-mile stretch of undeveloped coastline that encompasses the transition between

25 northern and southern marine and terrestrial ecological zones and adjacent to the eastern boundary

26 of Vandenberg Air Force Base.

27 16. The Project site is home to a variety of state and federally threatened or endangered plants and

28 wildlife, including the golden eagle, a fully protected bird species under state law. Sensitive

3
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

vegetation communities within the Project site include four types of native grassland, creeping

2 ryegrass turfs, foothill needlegrass grasslands, meadow barley patches, and purple needlegrass

3 grasslands, ten coastal scrub alliances including California brittle bush scrub, California coffee berry

4 scrub, California sagebrush scrub, coyote brush scrub, deerweed scrub, Menzies's golden bush scrub,

5 sawtooth golden bush scrub, purple sage scrub, silver bush lupine scrub, and toyon chaparral, three

6 riparian scrub alliances consisting of arroyo willow thickets, shrubland alliance, blue elderberry stands

7 and poison oak scrub, Fremont cottonwood forest, tanoak forest, and coast live oak woodland.

8 1. Gaviota Tarplant

9 17. Among the most sensitive plant species occurring within the Project site is Gaviota Tarplant

10 (Deinandra increscens ssp. villosa) ("Tarplant"), a federally and state-listed endangered plant that

11 occurs only in coastal California in Santa Barbara County. It is an annual species that occurs in

12 coastal bluff scrub, coastal scrub, and valley and foothill grasslands habitats at elevations of 66 to

13 1,411 feet. The blooming period of the Tarplant is between May and October.

14 18. When originally listed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW") and U.S.

15 Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS"), the Tarplant was thought to be restricted to about one mile

16 along the coastal terraces in Gaviota. Additional sites documented in later years have expanded the

17 current distribution in western Santa Barbara County with seven populations in Lion's Head (near

18 Point Sal), Point Arguello, Tranquillion Mountain/Sudden Peak, Point Conception, Hollister Ranch,

19 Santa Ynez Mountains, and Gaviota.

20 19. The proposed Project is located entirely within the Tranquillion Mountain/Sudden Peak

21 ("Sudden Peak") Tarplant population, which is by far the largest of the seven Tarplant populations.

22 DFW characterizes this population as a "major core population for the species," consisting of

23 5,080,360 individual plants, compared to less than 27,000 individual Tarplants in the other six

24 populations combined.

25 20. The SEIR estimates the total amount of occupied Sudden Peak Tarplant acreage as 207 acres.

26 The SEIR. states that annual Tarplant populations are not stable during any one year or from one year

27 to the next and that, within any single year, their numbers range from zero (before germination) to

28 sometimes very large numbers of seedlings, and then decline as some of the plants die while others

4
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

grow, flower and set seed as the season progresses, eventually to zero following late-season die-off.

2 These varying numbers reflect differences in rainfall, temperatures, soil disturbance, grazing by

3 livestock, insects, or other animals, and other ecological factors.

4 21. The SEIR states that the large number of Tarplants surveyed "indicates a large and

5 well-established population occupying approximately 207 acres of the Project site." The entire

6 791-acre Sudden Peak Unit of critical habitat for Gaviota tarplant is located within the Project site.

7 2. Golden Eagle

8 22. The golden eagle is a federally and state listed raptor, which is fully protected under state law,

9 Fish and Game Code § 3511. Several golden eagle nest sites have been located adjacent to the

10 Project area in recent year surveys, which have also detected golden eagles routinely flying through

11 and over the Project site, including in areas proposed for siting WTGs. Golden eagles were detected

12 in 18% of the total 1,841 raptor detections documented in surveys conducted in 2018-2019. Across

13 the 646 hours of surveys, raptors were detected in flight within the wind turbine rotor swept zone for

14 approximately 94 hours, with golden eagles contributing 28 hours (30 percent) of these observations.

15 Among raptors detected, golden eagles were the second most common, behind only red-tailed hawks.

16 Golden eagle flight paths were recorded throughout the site during the 2018-2019 raptor point count

17 surveys, and flight paths do not appear to coincide with topography or vegetation community or the

18 observer 800-m survey area.

19 B. 2008 LOMPOC WIND ENERGY PROJECT.

20 33. An earlier wind project in a similar location known as the Lompoc Wind Energy Project

21 ("LWEP") was approved in 2008. With respect to project impacts on the Tarplant, the LWEP EIR

22 stated that "[o]f approximately 128 acres known to be occupied by Gaviota tarplant onsite, the Project

23 would temporarily disturb about 22.4 acres and permanently disturb an additional 10.3 acres.

24 34. In contrast, the SWEP SEIR states that "[o]f the total 207.15 acres of occupied habitat on the

25 site, a total of 26.33 acres of permanent impacts to Gaviota tarplant occupied habitat would occur

26 from construction of the SWEP... compared with 10.3 acres under the LWEP."

27 34. The LWEP proposed more WTGs, which were, however, not as large as those proposed in

28 the SWEP (397 feet tall as compared to 492 feet tall for the SWEP.) In addition, the SWEP rotor

5
Potitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 blades are larger and would extend closer to the ground at the low point of each rotation than those

2 proposed in the LWEP. The SEIR states that the SWEP may place the rotor-swept area into the flight

3 paths of birds or bats that would have flown over or under the LWEP turbines.

4 C. PROJECT IMPACTS AND PROPOSED MITIGATION.

5 1. Project Impacts to Gaviota Tarplant and Proposed Mitigation.

6 23. The SEIR calculates the impacts to Tarplant and its habitat as direct and indirect construction

7 impacts. According to the SEIR, a total of 26.3 acres of direct and "permanent" impacts to Tarplant

8 occupied habitat would occur from construction of the SWEP from the total of 207.15 acres of

9 occupied habitat on the site.

10 24. The SEIR also references "indirect" impacts to the Tarplant, described as isolation, habitat

11 fragmentation, and pollinator impacts. The SEIR does not quantify but instead downplays these

12 impacts, stating that "[b]y their nature, indirect impacts tend to be more substantial immediately

13 adjacent to a work site or facility, and their importance declines with increasing distance" and that

14 "[t]he land uses surrounding occupied Gaviota tarplant habitat will be largely unchanged." The SEIR

15 concludes: "These indirect impacts cannot be quantified in terms of acreage but are far less important

16 than direct impacts even immediately adjacent to the Project footprint, and decline in importance over

17 relatively short distances. The majority of Gaviota tarplant habitat on the site would be subject to little

18 or no indirect disturbance."

19 25. In contrast, DFW's comments identified that the Project could impact over 90 percent of the

20 overall Sudden Peak population due to the combination of direct and indirect impacts. DFW further

21 objected to the SEIR's failure to undertake an effort to quantify impacts beyond the grading footprint

22 in order to disclose the full range of impacts from project construction and operation that is supported

23 by the scientific research. DFW identifies that the lack of such mitigation is problematic when

24 available scientific information indicates that there would be project activities that could result in

25 adverse effects to the Tarplant outside of the project grading footprint.

26 26. The SEIR acknowledges that the SWEP would permanently impact 94.51 acres of Tarplant

27 critical habitat (12.3 percent of the total mapped on site) but states that "at the scale occupied habitat

28 was mapped in the field surveys, much of the designated critical habitat is not occupied."

6
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

27. The SEIR concludes that SWEP impacts to Gaviota tarplant and its habitat, including

2 occupied, suitable, and designated critical habitat, would be significant absent mitigation measures

3 ("MM"). The SEIR states that MMs BIO-1, BIO-2, BIO-3, BIO-5, BIO-6, BIO-11c, and BIO-11d

4 are necessary to reduce or avoid impacts to Gaviota tarplant and its habitat. These measures would

5 require that 1) workers undergo environmental awareness training (MM BIO-1), 2) ground

6 disturbance is minimized (MM BIO-2); 3) the site is restored following construction (MM BIO-3);

7 4) Gaviota tarplant mitigation is implemented (MM BIO-6); and 5) monitoring and reporting occur

8 (BIO-11c, and BIO-11d.) The SEIR also states that, "[t]o the extent feasible, turbine micrositing will

9 avoid Gaviota tarplant habitat (MM BIO-15(a)). According to the SEIR, "[t]hese measures would

10 ensure construction impacts to Gaviota tarplant remain less than significant," which the SEIR refers

11 to as "Class II" impacts.

12 28. Mitigation measure BIO-6 requires the Project owner/operator to prepare a Gaviota Tarplant

13 Mitigation Plan ("Mitigation Plan"), and to obtain an Incidental Take Permit ("ITP") from DFW and

14 a Biological Opinion ("BO") from the USFWS for impacts to the Tarplant. MM BIO-6 requires that

15 permanent disturbance to the Tarplant be mitigated at a minimum 3:1 ratio and that areas of

16 temporary disturbance shall be restored to pre-disturbance conditions and compensated at a 3:1 ratio.

17 To accomplish this, soil seed bank material and/or whole post-flowering Gaviota tarplant material

18 (containing seed) will be salvaged from occupied habitat before construction-related disturbance. The

19 seed bank or plant material will be managed to maintain seed viability and will be used to supplement

20 onsite revegetation where appropriate as specified in the Mitigation Plan. The mitigation strategy

21 could also include offsite preservation of existing population occurrences. Compensatory mitigation

22 for Tarplant in the form of "compensation lands" will be managed according to the Mitigation Plan.

23 29. The Mitigation Plan shall be submitted by the Project owner/operator to the County along with

24 the ITP, BO and detailed grading plan. The detailed grading plan, showing the limits of the grading

25 shall be reviewed and approved by County staff prior to approval of the final plans.

26 30. MM BIO-6 incorporates by reference Mitigation Measure BIO-3, Site Restoration and

27 Revegetation Plan, for how "seed bank or plant material will be managed to maintain seed viability

28 and ...to supplement onsite revegetation." MM BIO-3 requires preparation of a Site Restoration and

Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 Revegetation Plan ("Restoration Plan"), in which "[i]mpacts to sensitive vegetation or habitat types

2 ...will be restored to replace prior habitat values; impacts to other vegetation or habitat will be

3 revegetated to prevent future erosion or weed invasion."

4 31. The Restoration Plan will identify quantitative success criteria for all habitat restoration,

5 including 1) requiring that restoration areas support at least 80 percent of the prior native species

6 abundance; 2) top soil, and the seed bank it contains, shall be conserved on areas where soil is

7 excavated such as WTG sites, access roads, and transmission pole locations; 3) the upper 6 to 8

8 inches of soil shall be scraped from the disturbance footprint and piled into stockpiles in areas that

9 will not be disturbed during construction; 4) salvaged topsoil shall be redistributed on areas that will

10 be revegetated following construction; 5) new plantings shall be irrigated with drip irrigation on a

11 timer, and shall be weaned off of irrigation over a period of two to three years; 6) permanent impacts

12 to vegetation will be mitigated by replacement of all habitats except disturbed and developed areas

13 at a 3:1 ratio per impacted vegetation type for sensitive vegetation; and 7) replacement will occur via

14 permanent protection of existing habitat with the same functional value as impacted habitat, onsite

15 restoration, or both. Impacted vegetation types must be proportionally represented within proposed

16 habitat compensation area(s) to ensure in-kind mitigation. MM BIO-3 also requires the Project

17 Owner/Applicant to identify suitable compensation lands for permanent vegetation impacts and

18 record a conservation easement in a form approved by the County that protects the proposed

19 conservation area in perpetuity.

20 32. The SEIR also includes MM BIO-14 Indirect Impacts, which requires the Project operators

21 to take precautionary measures to control the spread of invasive weed species, which could establish

22 on site and displace native plant species or interfere with revegetation; topsoil removal and equipment

23 operation could reduce the ability of soils to support vegetation. This mitigation measure requires

24 preparation of a Weed Control Plan for all ground disturbance. The Weed Control Plan shall be

25 submitted to the County for review and approval and shall be updated and implemented for weed

26 eradication and monitoring for the life of the proposed Project The SEIR finds implementation of MM

27 BIO-14 will ensure impacts from nonnative invasive weeds are less than significant (Class II).

1 2. Project Impacts to Golden Eagle and Proposed Mitigation.

2 33. Golden eagles are extremely sensitive to additional mortality because: (a) they occur at very

3 low densities, and (b) a relatively high percentage of juveniles do not survive to breeding age The

4 likelihood that a wind energy project will kill eagles depends on how close the project footprint is to

5 an eagle territory. If the size of territories in the project region is not known, the USFWS

6 recommends that the developer consider the project a threat to all eagles associated with nests that

7 are within 10 miles of the Project footprint. Recent surveys in this proceeding have revealed the

8 presence of at least five eagle nests within 10 miles of the Project site.

9 34. Wind energy development can affect eagles in a variety of ways. The primary threat to eagles

10 from wind facilities is due to fatalities caused by colliding with structures such as wind turbines. Such

11 mortality effects may result in the permanent or long term loss of a nesting territory,

12 35. Project surveys have made numerous sightings of golden eagles in the air traveling through

13 the future range of the WTG rotor blades. The SEIR identifies likely bird mortality resulting from

14 collisions with the operating WTGs, and identifies this as a significant and unavoidable impact as

15 "currently there is no proven method to prevent such collisions.» The SEIR identifies the killing of

16 any golden eagle to be a significant impact.

17 36. As mitigation, the SEIR proposes : series of measures including 1) MM BIO-15a (micrositing

18 of WTGs); 2) MM BIO-15b (design features, early detection systems and aviation warning lights);

19 3) MMBIO-16 (monitoring and development of adaptive management plan where bird fatalities cross

20 a certain significance threshold); 4) MM BIO-16a (before/after control impact study); 5) MM BIO-16

21 b (bird/bat mortality study); 6) MM BIO-16c (removal of carrion near turbines); 7) MM BIO-16d

22 (adaptive management plan).

23 37. In addition, in the FSEIR, the Project added several new mitigation measures as follows: 1)

24 preparation of a Bat and Bird Conservation strategy; 2) requirement that obtain authorization from

25 USFWS for a take of golden eagles or a written statement that take authorization is not needed; and

26 3) implement a program to prevent carrion attractants to large raptors.

1 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of CEQA)
2
38. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
3
39. An EIR must also contain an adequate project description. County of Inyo V. City of Los
4
Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App.3d 185, 192-193. The SEIR's project description does not provide
5
full and accurate information regarding the siting and specific locations of Wind Turbine Generators
6 ("WTGs"), transmission lines, roads, and other associated infrastructure. The specific locations of
these Project components must be adequately presented so that Respondent, responsible and trustee
8
agencies, and the general public can accurately assess Project impacts to the Tarplant, golden eagle
9 and other plants and wildlife within the Project area.
10
40. An EIR must evaluate reasonable alternatives or mitigation measures capable of eliminating
11 any significant adverse environmental effects of a project, or reducing them to a level of
12
insignificance, even though such alternatives/mitigation may somewhat impede attainment of project
13 objectives, or may be more costly. Pub. Res. Code § 21002; 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15126.6; Citizens
14
for Quality Growth v. City of Mount Shasta (1988) 198 Cal. App.3d 433, 443 445. The SEIR fails
15 to consider a reasonable range of alternatives, including consideration of an alternative that would
16
avoid or substantially lessen the significant Project impacts on Tarplant, golden eagle and other plants
17 and wildlife within the Project footprint. The SEIR also improperly limits its consideration of
18
alternatives by defining its Project objectives in a manner that is too narrow such as by rejecting any
19 alternative that does not generate the 102 MW of power claimed necessary for the Project to be
20
"feasible.' Where a project impact will be significant, an EIR's failure to consider any alternative that
21
would avoid or substantially lessen that impact is contrary to CEQA. See Pub. Res. Code § 21002.
22
41. The SEIR acknowledge that Project facilities such as roads or WTGs would be located within
23 most of the mapped Gaviota tarplant polygons within the site. However, the SEIR fails to consider
24
or analyze adequately the indirect impacts of the Project on the Tarplant due to habitat fragmentation
25
and resulting isolation of remnant Tarplant occurrences within the critical Sudden Peak population,
26
trampling, altered hydrology, chemicals, fugitive dust, increased abundance of invasive plant and
27 animal species, decreased abundance of pollinators, and increased risk from stochastic events such
28 as wildfire. The SEIR instead asserts that indirect impacts cannot be quantified in terms of acreage,

10
Petitioner's Vcrified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

are less important than direct impacts and that the majority of Tarplant habitat would be subject to

2 little or no indirect disturbance. The SEIR's failure to consider indirect impacts on the Tarplant does

3 not meet CEQA's informational standards.

4 42. CEQA does not allow lead agencies to defer the impact analyses or development of mitigation

5 measures until after project approval unless: it is impracticable to develop mitigation measures during

6 the CEQA process, there is evidence that future mitigation is feasible, and the project is required to
meet specific performance standards. POET, LLC v. State Air Resources Bd. (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th

8 681, 736; CEQA Guidelines 15126.4(a)(1)(B). Here, the SEIR unlawfully defers the formulation

9 and implementation of the Tarplant Mitigation Plan, which was never subject to CEQA review, yet

10 which is 1) the central requirement for MM BIO-6; and 2) the critical document for determining how
11 and/or whether the performance objectives set forth in MM BIO-6 can be met. Further, in the absence

12 of the Mitigation Plan, the SEIR lacks substantial evidence to support its findings that the

13 performance objectives set forth in MM BIO-6 can be feasibly met or that Project impacts to the

14 Tarplant can be feasibly mitigated to a level of insignificance.

15 43. The SEIR also improperly defers mitigation intended to substantially lessen impacts on the

16 golden eagle including the formulation of a Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy, a plan for preventing

17 carrion attractants, a plan for 'active control technology' to avoid raptor impacts, an Adaptive

18 a Management Plan,, a before-after/control-impact study and a mortality a study. Such mitigation

19 deferral is contrary to CEQA. Further, the SEIR improperly relies as mitigation on authorization from

20 USFWS for 'take' of golden eagles, is which is contrary to Fish and Game Code § 3511(a)(2).

21 44. The SEIR fails to provide adequate information or analysis regarding the significant impacts

22 to golden cagles. The SEIR provides no information regarding the extent of expected golden eagle

23 fatalities due to collisions with the larger WTGs proposed for the project. The SEIR describes a

24 single golden eagle death as a threshold of significance but provides no further analysis or information

25 as to the degree of expected Project impacts on several local breeding populations of golden eagle.

26 Where a potential project impact is considered to be significant, CEQA requires a full disclosure and

27 discussion of the degree of that impact, particularly with respect to a fully protected, endangered

28 species such as the golden eagle. See Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal. Sth 502, 519.

1 VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Fish and Game Code 3511)

45.
3 46. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
The Project as proposed and approved by the County will cause "take' of golden eagles due

5 to collisions with the Project WTGs, which the SEIR identifies a as a significant and unavoidable

6 impact as "currently there is no proven method to prevent such collisions." The Project violates Fish

7 & Game Code § 3511(a)(1), which does not allow 'take' of golden eagles.
47.
8 The Project SEIR proposes as a mitigation measure for Project impacts to golden eagles that

9 the Project applicant obtain authorization from USFWS for a 'take' of golden eagles. However, any

10 'take' of a fully protected species such as the golden eagle cannot constitute CEQA mitigation. See

11 Fish and Game Code § 3511(a)(2); Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife

12 (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204, 232-233.
