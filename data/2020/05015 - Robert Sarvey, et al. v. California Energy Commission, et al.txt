INTRODUCTION

4 1. This action arises out of the application for the licensing of a power producing

5 facility (the project) by an entity known as MECP1 Santa Clara, LLC (MECP or Applicant)

6 which seeks to build a data storage facility with backup diesel generating units to serve tech-

7 based businesses in Santa Clara, California. Respondent California Energy Commission (CEC,
8 Commission, or Respondent) has granted MECP an exemption from the Energy Commission's

9 jurisdiction (Small Power Plant Exemption, or SPPE) and allowed MECP to proceed with local

10 approval rather than requiring an Energy Commission AFC license and simultaneously proposes

11 to adopt a mitigated negative declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act

12 (CEQA). Petitioner Robert Sarvey opposes all of these actions and seeks a writ of mandamus to

13 rescind the issuance of the SPPE and compel production of an Environmental Impact Report

14 (EIR) assessing the project more fully.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 2. Venue is proper because Respondent California Energy Commission is a state

17 agency based and holding its hearings in the County of Sacramento. The particular committee

18 appointed by the Commission to decide on MECP's application for an SPPE likewise held its

19 hearings on the matter in the California Energy Commission offices in Sacramento.

20 3. Petitioner Robert Sarvey is a private citizen residing in Tracy, California. He has

21 undertaken many activities to oppose inordinately polluting power plants in Northern California.

22 In particular, he is particularly concerned with the spate of proposed new power plants

23

appurtenant to data centers in the Silicon Valley area. Mr. Sarvey has commented at length on
*

2 the administrative proceedings underlying this complaint.

( 4. Petitioner Robert James Simpson is a private citizen residing in Castro a Valley,

4 California. Mr. Simpson is professional advocate and activist for environmental justice and co-

5 founder of Helping Hand Tools.

6 5. Petitioner Helping Hand Tools (2HT) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
7 | opposing polluting power installations and promoting environmental justice in California. 2HT

8 has members throughout northern California, including within the project's area of impact.

9 6. Applicant MECP, the real party in interest, is a limited liability corporation
10 headquartered in Santa Clara, California, which submitted an application to the Respondent in

11 Sacramento County for the purpose of obtaining an exemption and CEQA clearance to move

12 ahead with the proposed project. MECP's business touches all counties of the San Francisco Bay

13 Area.

14 7. Respondent Does are included to anticipate a relevant party or parties whose

15 actions have yet to come to light that may affect the disposition of this petition and whose

16 actions may fall under the causes of action included herein.

17 8. No adequate remedy at law exists because the CEQA process fills a unique role in

18 protecting California's environment, and the failure to prepare an EIR will damage that

19 environment in ways that are nigh impossible to assess and countermand without comprehensive

20 environmental review.

21 9. Administrative remedies have been exhausted because Respondent CEC has

22 ignored their own regulations in issuing the SPPE. Likewise, the adoption of an MND means that

23 the Commission has found that environmental impacts of the proposed project are likely to fall

A A PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE (CODE CIV. PROC. §§ 1085 & 1094.5) - 3

T under the threshold of significance under CEQA. Thus, Respondents have foreclosed on

2 meaningful opportunities to comment on and influence the CEQA decisionmaking process and

UJ thereby denied Petitioner's access to relief through administrative remedies.

4 STATEMENT OF FACTS

5 9. As part of their plan to construct a data storage facility in Santa Clara, California,

6 MECP intends to build a backup generating facility, known as the Laurelwood Data Center

7 (LDC). To serve potential supplementary power needs, the LDC is planned to include an array of

8 56 3.0 megawatt (MW) diesel generators, employing the combustion of diesel fuel to run engines

9 and supply emergency electrical power as needed to the facility. The LDC has applied to the

10 CEC to grant an SPPE, which the Commission is empowered to do by statute in cases where

11 generating capacity is below 100 MW.

12 10. Santa Clara only lists the project's IS/MND on the Santa Clara website, with no

13 application yet filed at BAAQMD for Authority to Construct permits.

14 11. By filing for an SPPE, MECP obliged the California Energy Commission to take

15 over as lead agency for the purposes of determining the need for environmental assessment unden

16 CEQA. Respondents CEC have relied partly on Santa Clara's Climate Action Plan to assess

17 likely air quality and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) impacts of the LDC.

18 12. In their application for the SPPE, Applicant states that the project is eligible for an

19 SPPE because it's maximum load for the project does not exceed 100MW. Likewise, MECP

P states in its initial application that it is under a contractual obligation not to exceed 100 MW of

2 generation.

UJ 13. Applicant states that its Nitrogen dioxide (NOx) emissions from the diesel

4 generating units is 94 tons per year (tpy)2, while the proposed offset measures would mitigate

5 only 28.4 tons of NOx emissions®, leaving an unmitigated total of 65.6 tpy.

6 14. Of a proposed seven data centers with diesel generation plant backup plans either

7 under consideration or already approved for licensing by CEC, the LDC stands to potentially

8 have the largest impacts in terms of total megawatt hours (MWh) of power generated and

9 commensurate GHG impacts. Together, these seven data centers will make up nearly 50% of
10 projected annual GHG emissions in Santa Clara*.

11 15. Respondent CEC relies in part upon the fact that the diesel generators proposed

12 for the project are not turbines in order to exempt the projects diesel generators from the CEC's

. 13 only regulation for computing generating capacity Section 2003 of the CEC' rules of practice

14 and procedure. This is despite the fact the CEC has previously used Section 2003 to compute the
15 generating capacity of diesel generators in three separate siting cases.5 The CFC then proposes a

2 Center case5.

•

3 16. Respondent CEC did not recirculate the Initial Study/Proposed MND (IS/MND)

4 after adding subsequent new proposed mitigation measures.

5 17. Respondent CEC failed to include BAAQMD as a responsible agency in its

6 provision of the (IS/MND) to the State Clearinghouse. Respondent failed to inform the State
7 Clearinghouse of the public opposition to the project.

8 18. Respondent CEC failed to allow for any public comment after revisions to the

9 IS/MND.

10 19. Respondent CEC in the Proposed Decision granting an SPPE failed to apply

11 BAAQMD's 100 hour testing standard in assessing GHGs and other emissions when it assessed

12 the project for eligibility for an SPPE.

13 20. Respondent CEC failed to adequately assess impacts on the surrounding
14 community, including a failure to account for environmental justice (EJ) impacts on non-English

15 speaking communities and emissions impacts outside of a few select zones in the project area.
16 No hearings or workshops were held in Santa Clara assessing community feedback regarding the

17 project.

18 21. Petitioner Robert Sarvey has long taken an interest in polluting power facilities,

19 starting with a dirty power plant proposed to be sited near his home in Tracy some years ago.

20 Petitioner Robert Simpson takes a professional interest as an activist and founder of 2HT to

21

23

PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE (CODE CIV. PROC. §§ 1085 & 1094.5) - 6

- oppose

2 unlawful diesel power installations. 2HT itself has as its purpose the oversight and
enforcement of laws regarding power facilities, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area.

4 Petitioners now seeks a writ of administrative mandamus under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1085 and

5 1094.5 asking the Court to set aside the grant of the SPPE as improper, to void the CEC's

6 adoption of the MND as both procedurally unlawful and substantively incorrect, and to order the

7 CEC and any other responsible parties to compel preparation of a full EIR as CEQA requires.

8 LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

9 22.

10 Proc. Petitioner requests the grant of a writ of mandate under both Cal. Code of Civ.

1085, which allows challenges to agency authority in a ministerial capacity; and Cal.

11 Code of Civ Proc. § 1094.5, which allows for challenges of an agency's exercise of

12 administrative authority.

13 23. Petitioner contends that Respondents have violated several California statutes and

14 regulations, both in the grant of an SPPE to MECP, and in the adoption of an MND authorizing

15 the LDC without a full environmental review under CEQA. Likewise, Respondents' provision of

16 notice and process allowing for public participation was clearly deficient, violating both

17 California statutes pertaining to these rights on behalf of stakeholders, and the due process

18 provisions of the US Constitution.

19 24. Respondent has authority to grant SPPEs for thermal generating facilities "not

20 exceeding 100 megawatts" under 20 Cal. Code of Reg. § 1934 et seq.

A A 20 Cal. Code of Reg. § 1936. PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE (CODE CIV. PROC. §§ 1085 & 1094.5) - 7

25. 14 Cal. Code of Reg. § 15051 empowers Respondent to act as lead agency for

2 making determinations under CEQA for all power plant siting cases in California.

3 26. CEQA, codified under Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq., requires the lead

4 agency to make a determination as to whether a proposed project may have significant impacts.

5 The lead agency may only approve a proposed negative declaration if there are no significant

6 impacts°; or in the case of an MND, if the proposed mitigation measures would bring the likely

7 level of impacts below the threshold for significance. The lead agency may adopt a negative
8 declaration"; or if the potentially significant impacts have been sufficiently mitigated in the

9 project's proposal, a mitigated negative declaration (MND)10 only if there is no substantial

10 evidence in the record of significant environmental impacts resulting from the project. Otherwise,

11 a lead agency must compel the applicant for project approval to prepare an Environmental

12 Impact Report (EIR)'' so that the public and governmental agencies may assess the full potential

13 environmental impacts of the project, as well as evaluate the potential mitigation measures

14 proposed to address these impacts.

15 27. Both CEQA and Title 20 of the Cal. Code of Reg. contain notice provisions,

16 requiring the lead agency to provide notice and a fair hearing to concerned stakeholders in power

17 plant siting proceedings. Adoption of an MND requires noticelz, posting at the sitel3, and

18 publication of the proposed MND14.

1 28. CEQA guidance denies the lead agency the power to adopt an MND and reject

2 preparation of an EIR, if:

3 a. There are feasible alternatives that would substantially lessen any significant adverse

4 impacts the project may have on the environment"; or

5 b. Notice of the proposed adoption of the MND is inadequate, or if the lead agency

6 provides insufficient opportunity for interested parties to comment on the proposed

7 plan'o; or

8 C. The lead agency does not specifically respond to evidence that the proposed activity

9 would have a substantial adverse impact on the environment7.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 29. Petitioner incorporates paragraphs 9-28 as if included fully herein.

12 30. The first cause of action is a violation of the statute governing the grant of an

13 SPPE. Petitioner contends that Respondent both applied an unlawful standard in assessing the

14 generating capacity of the proposed project; and did not fully assess the potential environmental

15 impacts of the project.

16 31. Respondent CEC has applied an underground regulation in calculating the
17 applicability of the project for an SPPE. This standard involves application of rules in opposition

18 to CEC regulations because the proposed generating units utilize diesel engines instead of

turbines, despite the fact that CEC has applied their applicable regulations to diesel engines in

2 the past.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 32. Petitioner incorporates paragraphs 8-27 as if included fully herein.

5 33. The second cause of action is a failure to apply the structures of CEQA in

6 adopting an MND for this project. Specifically, Petitioners argue that:

7 i. By incorrectly calculating the generating capacity of the proposed project in

8 violation of its own regulations and BAAQMD guidelines, CEC failed to comply

9 with CEQA; and

10 ii. CEC failed to comply with CEQA when it did not adequately address evidence of

11 excessive emissions from the proposed project; and

12 iii. CEC failed to comply with CEQA when it did not adequately address the

13 potential environmental justice impacts of the proposed project, including failing

.14 to comply with notice and recirculation provisions of CEQA; and

15 iv. CEC failed to comply with CEQA when it deemed inadequate mitigation

16 measures acceptable under CEQA.

17 V. CEC failed to properly estimate the indirect GHG emissions from the LDC as

18 required by 15064.4 of the CEQA Guidelines despite substantial evidence and a fair

19 argument to the contrary.

20 vi. CEC failed to properly apply the CEQA Guidelines of another agency, the

21 BAAQMD, in determining the significance of the projects emissions.

•

22 vii. CEC improperly relied on the failing GHG Climate Action Plan of the City of

23 Santa Clara to determine the LDC's GHG emissions were not significant despite
PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE (CODE CIV. PROC. §§ 1085 & 1094.5) -
AA 10

the fact that the LDC's emissions would not occur during the planning horizon of

2 the plan.

DAMAGES

34. Damages resulting from this action include potential emissions exceeding the
levels set by various federal, state, and local agencies, and subsequent adverse environmental

6 effects harming the health and safety of the surrounding community of the people of California.

This would also include direct adverse impacts on the designated environmental justice

8 communities nearby.

35. Failure to follow emissions standards as regards greenhouse gases also negatively

10 impact California's goals of combating climate change.

11 36. Additionally, CEC's adoption of an improper standard for issuing exemptions

12 from state power plant siting regulations may result in future cases where that improper standard

13 is applied to other applications, incurring similar adverse environmental effects and allowing the

14 construction of power production facilities that violate state law.

15

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 37. Petitioners ask that the court issue a peremptory writ, directing Respondent CEC

•* 18 to vacate their issue of an SPPE and direct Respondents to order LDC to prepare an EIR under

19 CEQA in order to proceed with the project.

20 38. Petitioners ask for declaratory relief in setting the standard for calculation of

21 generating capacity for purposes of the grant of a small power plant exemption for power plants
