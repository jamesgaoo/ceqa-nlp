To the Attorney General of the State of California:

3 Civil Procedure Section 388, that on December 15, 2020, Petitioners Costa Pacifica Estates
Homeowners Association, Robert Hatfield and Harold Orndorff filed a Petition for Writ of

5 Mandamus against Respondents County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the

6 County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents") in the above-referenced Court.

7 This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connection with the adoption of

8 Resolution No. 2020-243 for approval of a Temporary Commercial Outdoor Entertainment
9 License for up to six concert events in 2021 to be held at Santa Maria Raceway/Stadium 805
10 located at 1900 Hutton Road, Nipomo and determination that the project is exempt from the
11 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The claimed exemptions do not apply to the
12 Project and the project applicants intend on continuing and applying for ongoing events
13 beyond 2021. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors CEQA determination was piecemealed as
14 the "whole of the action" was not considered. 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15378(a). A project is

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors for the County of San Luis
Obispo ("County") approved an application of Real Party in Interest Nicholas M. Duggan for a 4

5 Temporary Commercial Outdoor Entertainment License for up to six concert events in 2021 to

6 be held at Santa Maria Raceway/Stadium 805 located at 1900 Hutton Road, Nipomo (Project).

7 However, Petitioners Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association, Robert Hatfield and

8 Harold Orndorff (*Petitioners") are informed and believe that the applicant will apply for

9 future permits to hold concerts on an ongoing basis and from year-to-year.

10 2. The County determined that the Project is not subject to the California

11 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"--Pub. Resources Code 21000 et seq.) claiming that the

12 Project is categorically exempt from CEQA under 14 Cal. Code Regs sections 15301,

13 "Existing Facilities," and 15323 "Normal Operations of Existing Facilities for Public

14 Gatherings."

15 3. Petitioners Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association, Robert Hatfield

16 and Harold Orndorff ("Petitioners") challenge the approval of the Project and adoption of the

17 Categorical Exemptions under CEQA because the Project does not fall within the scope of

18 these exemptions. See Save Our Big Trees v. City of Santa Cruz (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 694,

19 707; Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125; Wildlife

20 Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205.

21 4. On November 13, 2020, the County filed a Notice of Exemption, and, pursuant

22 to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 35 days thereof.

20 9. Respondent County of San Luis Obispo, through Respondent Board of

21 Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo (collectively, "Respondents"), is a political

22 subdivision of the State of California and has determined the Project to be categorically exempt

23 from CEQA. On November 10, 2020, Respondents approved the Project and determined the

24 Project to be categorically exempt from the provisions of CEQA.

25 10. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of

26 Does 1-15 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious

6 set forth herein.

7 20. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Costa

10 Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association reside in the County of San Luis Obispo, and

11 include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the

12 violations of CEQA. Approval of the Project and adoption of an exemption from CEQA will

13 adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association

14 and its members. Petitioner Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association and its members

15 have expressed their concerns and commented on the Project during the administrative

16 proceedings wherein the Project was considered. Accordingly, Petitioner Costa Pacifica

17 Estates Homรจowners Association is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public

18 Resources Code ยง 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that

19 participation in the litigation by individual members is not required.

3 who is dedicated to preserving the environment of the County of San Luis Obispo as set forth,

4 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.]

27.
6 Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 26 as if fully
set forth herein.
7
28.
8 Respondents' determination that the Project is categorically exempt from CEQA

9 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to act in a manner

10 required by law when they determined the Project to be exempt from environmental review

11 under the Class 1, "Existing Facilities," and Class 23, 15323 "Normal Operations of Existing

12 Facilities for Public Gatherings.' CEQA categorical exemptions. Petitioners are informed and

13 believe that the Real Parties in Interest intend to apply for future permits to hold concerts on an

14 ongoing basis and from year-to-year. Therefore, Respondents are engaging in piecemeal

15 environmental review because they claim an exemption for the first phase of the Project. The

16 CEQA Guidelines state that ''Project' means the whole of an action, which has a potential for

17 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable

18 indirect physical change in the environment [including] [a]n activity directly undertaken by

19 any public agency...." 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15378(a). A project is defined broadly in order

20 to maximize environmental protection. City of Santee v. County of San Diego (Santee) (1989)

21 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1452; McQueen V. Board of Directors of the Mid-peninsula Regional

22 Open Space District (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143 (disapproved on other grounds). A

23 project must be defined and accurately described to ensure an "intelligent evaluation of the

24 potential environmental effects of a proposed activity." Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport

25 Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592 (citing McQueen v. Bd. of Directors,

26 supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at 1143-44). "A narrow view of a project could result in the fallacy of

27 division, that is, overlooking its cumulative impact by separately focusing on isolated parts of

28 the whole." Id.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

29. Furthermore, Respondents interpret the exemptions contrary to law. The Class

2 exemption for Existing Facilities under CEQA Guidelines section 15301 only applies to uses

3 that involve "negligible or no expansion of existing or former use." 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง

4 15301. This approval is an expansion of the use. Similarly, the Class 23 exemption under

5 CEQA Guidelines section 15323 for Normal Operations of Facilities for Public Gatherings

6 does not apply because the concerts are not a part of the normal operation of the Santa Maria

7 Raceway, and such use is beyond the scope of the exemption. The interpretation of the

8 exemption presents a question of law for the Court's independent review. Moreover,

9 Respondents' factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence. Therefore,
10 environmental review is required.

11 VI

12 ATTORNEYS' FEES

13 30. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully

14 set forth herein.

15 31. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the

16 People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and

17 Real Parties in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of

18 Civil Procedure $ 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

19 VII

20 INJUNCTION

21 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 27 as if fully

22 set forth herein.

23 33. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

24 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

25 34. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

26 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

27 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

28 35. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

2 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

3 their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

36. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
are threatening to proceed with operation of the Project in the near future. Said
6 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

7 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

8 37. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

9 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,
10 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of San Luis Obispo and the State

11 of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions
12 described herein are not set aside.

13 38. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
14 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

15 39. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

16 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
17 Project and determination of exemption from environmental review.

18

19 PRAYER

20 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

21 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

22 aside Resolution No. 2020-243 and any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to,

23 approval of a Temporary Commercial Outdoor Entertainment License for up to six concert

24 events in 2021 to be held at Santa Maria Raceway/Stadium 805 located at 1900 Hutton Road,
25 Nipomo.

26 2. For an order staying Respondents and Real Parties from engaging in any

27 activity pursuant to the Project until Respondents perform environmental review and the

28 Project complies with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Dear Members of the Board of Supervisors:
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Costa Pacifica Estates Homeowners Association, Robert Hatfield, and Harold Orndorff will commence litigation against the County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connection with the adoption of Resolution No. 2020-243 for approval of a Temporary Commercial Outdoor Entertainment License for up to six concert events in 2021 to be held at Santa Maria Raceway/Stadium 805 located at 1900 Hutton Road, Nipomo and determination that the project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The claimed exemptions do not apply to the Project and the project applicants intend on continuing and applying for ongoing events beyond 2021. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors CEQA determination was piecemealed as the "whole of the action"* was not considered. 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15378(a). A project is defined broadly in order to maximize environmental protection. City of Santee v. County of San Diego (Santee) (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1452; McQueen v. Board of Directors of the Mid-peninsula Regional Open Space District (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143 (disapproved on other grounds); Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592 (citing McQueen v. Bd, of Directors, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at 1143-44).
This litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the CEQA (Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.). ยง
