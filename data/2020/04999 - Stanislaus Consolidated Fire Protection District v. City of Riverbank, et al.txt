NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

I TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and

3 Code of Civil Procedure section 388, that on January 29, 2020, Petitioner Stanislaus Consolidated

4 Fire Protection District (the "District") filed a First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and

5 Complaint Re General Plan Inconsistency and Declaratory Relief (the "First Amended Petition")

6 against Respondent City of Riverbank (*Respondent") in Stanislaus County Superior Court.

7 The District previously notified the Attorney General of the State of California of its

8 initial petition for writ of mandate and complaint (*Petition") in the above-captioned matter on or

9 about August 2, 2019.

10 As in the Petition, the District alleges in the First Amended Petition that Respondent
violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000, et seq.; "CEQA")
10 S3O1:0 MV1 06E ELINS '133HIS NIVW 'N L0OZ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 12 by certifying an environmental impact report (State Clearinghouse No. 2017032062) for the

15 Respondent approved the Project in violation of California's Planning and Zoning Law and that

16 the Project is not consistent with the City of Riverbank's General Plan.

17 The exact nature of the District's allegations and relief sought is described in the First

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Plaintiff and Petitioner STANISLAUS CONSOLIDATED FIRE PROTECTION

2 DISTRICT (hereinafter, "Petitioner" or "District") alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This action challenges the decision of defendant and respondent CITY OF

5 RIVERBANK ("Respondent" or "City") to certify an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for

6 the Crossroads West Specific Plan (the "Project") under the California Environmental Quality

7 Act ("CEQA") and approve the Project-a decision that potentially endangers the City's residents

8 and exacerbates the risk of fire hazards in the City.
9 2. The District has repeatedly apprised the City of the EIR's shortcomings and the

10 Project's inconsistency with the City's fire-related General Plan policies, but the City has paid

dO SEO30 MV1 390 LINS '1338LS NIVIN N LOOZ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 11 little heed to the District's concerns. Indeed, the City has dismissed the District's concerns by
12 erroneously contending, among other things, that "[a]dequate equipment, staffing, facilities and

13 response times for fire protection services are issues that are not physical impacts to the

14 environment that must be addressed through the EIR process, or require mitigation under CEQA."
15 The City contends that it has no obligation to analyze the Project's impacts on fire protection

16 services or to mitigate those impacts. The City is wrong. To protect the people it serves, the

17 District has no choice but to file this action.

18 3. The Project seeks to fundamentally transform a 380-acre swath of land ("Subject

19 Property") currently dedicated to agricultural purposes, including a cow dairy operation with 550

20 milking cows and row crops. The Project entails, among other things, development of the Subject

21 Property with at least 2,452 residential units (including high density residential units) and 577,000

22 square feet of mixed uses (including retail uses and up to 350 additional residential units). The

23 City concedes that the Project would result in population growth by bringing thousands of people

24 to the area.

25 4, Despite the obvious enormity of the Project, the City failed to properly analyze the

26 Project's impact on fire protection services or the Project's consistency with the City's fire-

27 related General Plan policies. Instead, the City ignored the District's repeated concerns, certified

28 the EIR, and approved the Project. In doing so, the City failed to properly exercise its duties as a • 2 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

2 lead agency under CEQA (Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. and California Code of

3 Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. [State CEQA Guidelines]) and failed to ensure the
Project's consistency with the City's General Plan.

4 5.

5 Through this lawsuit, the District seeks to enforce the provisions of CEQA as they

6 apply to this Project and to ensure the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. The

7 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by

8 protecting the public from the unmitigated and unanalyzed harms alleged in this First Amended
Petition and Complaint.

9 THE PARTIES

13 California, located in the County of Stanislaus, California. The District is charged with providing

14 fire protection and fire safety services as authorized under the general laws of the State.

7.

15 Respondent and defendant City of Riverbank is, and at all relevant times was, a

16 municipal corporation and general law city, organized and existing under the laws of the State of

18 all times mentioned herein was, the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. (State CEQA
Guidelines, § 15051.)

19 8.

20 The District is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and

21 Defendants DOES through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues those Respondents and Defendants

22 under fictitious names. The District will amend this First Amended Petition and Complaint to

23 show their true names and capacities when the Respondents and Defendants have been identified

24 and their capacities ascertained. Each of the Respondents and Defendants is the agent, employee;

25 or both of every other Respondent and Defendant, and each performed acts on which this action is

26 based within the course and scope of such Respondent's and Defendant's agency, employment, or

27 both. The District is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that each Respondent and

28 Defendant is legally responsible in some manner for the events and happenings referred to herein.

22 THE DISTRICT'S INITIAL PETITION,

23 AND ITS DISMISSAL OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY NAMED PARTIES

14.

24 The District filed its initial Petition in this matter with the Stanislaus County

25 Superior Court on July 26, 2019. In the Petition, the District named as Real Parties in Interest

26 each entity listed as a "Project Applicant" for the Project on the Notice of Determination filed for

27 the Project on or about March 25, 2019. In particular, the District named the City as Respondent

28 and Defendant and the following as Defendants and Real Parties in Interest in this litigation:
(1) Western Pacific Holdings, Inc.; (2) Harrigfeld Family; (3) Machado Family; (4) McGrane
Living Trust (*McGrane"); (5) Browman Development Company, Inc. and (6) Bosio 2003 - 4-

1 Family L.P ("Bosio").

2 15. McGrane and Bosio granted the entirety of their interest in the Subject Property

3 away via a Grant Deed recorded in Stanislaus County on July 8, 2019. Thereafter, the Parties

4 entered into a Stipulation to Dismiss Real Parties in Interest McGrane Living Trust and Bosio

5 2003 Family L.P. (*Stipulation"), and this Stipulation was filed with the Court on November 4,

6 2019. In the Stipulation, the Parties agreed, among other things, that (1) McGrane and Bosio no

7 longer have an interest in the Subject Property; (2) McGrane and Bosio are not necessary or

8 indispensable parties to the above-captioned action pursuant to any statute; and (3) the District

9 would dismiss McGrane and Bosio within five days of the Parties' execution of the Stipulation.

10 16. After the Stipulation was fully executed and filed with the Court, McGrane and

11 Bosio were dismissed from this action on November 4, 2019.

13 17. This Court has jurisdiction to review the City's findings, approvals, and actions; to

14 issue a writ of mandate; and to grant declaratory and/or injunctive relief, as well as all other relief

15 sought herein, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 1085 and 1094.5; Public

16 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5; and Government Code section 65000, et seq.

17 VENUE

18 18. The Superior Court of the County of Stanislaus is the proper venue for this action.
19 The Project and the property it concerns are located within the County of Stanislaus. The Subject
20 Property is bounded on the east by Oakdale Road, on the south by Claribel Road, on the north by

21 the Modesto Irrigation District Main Canal and the City of Riverbank city limits, and on the west

22 by those property lines approximately one-half mile west of Oakland Road. The approval of the

23 Project without proper compliance with CEQA and without consistency with the City's General

24 Plan will expose the City's residents (and the people the District is charged to serve) to

25 heightened risk of fire-related injury and serious adverse environmental impacts.

26 STANDING

27 19. The District and those whom the District serves will be directly and adversely
28 affected by the City's actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project. The District has no 5 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in that the District and those

2 whom the District serves will suffer irreparable harm if the Project is implemented.

3 20. The District provides fire protection services to the people and area surrounding
the Subject Property, and the District would be responsible for providing fire protection services

5 to the Project's future residents and businesses. The Project, however, will adversely impact the

6 District's fire protection operations absent adequate mitigation. Accordingly, the District has a

7 beneficial interest in any action that challenges the City's decision to approve the Project without

8 (i) fully disclosing the Project's significant impacts on the environment, (ii) imposing all feasible

9 mitigation measures to avoid such impacts, and (iii) ensuring the Project's consistency with the

10 City's General Plan.

21.

LAW OFFICES OF 2001 N. MAIN STREET, SUIT : 390 d11 HO3IUM 8 1S38 1S38 969t6 VINJOJITVO 'X3380 LONTVM 11 The District objected to the City's approval of the Project during and after the
12 public comment periods provided by CEQA, and the District repeatedly requested that the City

13 comply with CEQA. The District and/or other agencies, organizations and individuals raised or

14 affirmed each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint orally or in writing

15 prior to the City's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR.

16 22. The District and the people it serves will be directly and substantially affected by
17 the adverse environmental impacts of the City's actions, including impacts resulting from the

18 Project's inconsistency with the General Plan's policies relating to fire protection services. The

19 District seeks to promote and enforce the informational purposes of CEQA in this action, which

20 purposes are defeated by the City's attempt to approve the Project without sufficient or accurate

21 information. Ascertaining the true facts about the environmental impacts of projects and

22 disclosing those true facts to decision-makers and the public are purposes that are within the zone

23 of interests CEQA was intended to protect.

24 23. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA and all other

25 applicable laws when certifying the EIR and approving the Project; the City further has an

26 obligation to ensure that the Project is consistent with the City's General Plan. The issues in this

27 action are issues of public right and the object of the action is to enforce public duties in the

28 public interest.
- 6 -

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 24. The District has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and, unless a

2 temporary restraining order and injunction is issued, the City will be allowed to proceed with the

3 Project without complying with CEQA and without ensuring the Project's consistency with the

4 City's General Plan.

5 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

6 25. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Public Resources Code

7 section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The District has exhausted

8 all available administrative remedies by objecting to the City's approval of the Project during and

9 after the public comment periods provided by CEQA, requesting that the City comply with

10 CEQA, and requesting that the City ensure the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan.

11 The District and/or other agencies, organizations, or individuals raised or affirmed each of the
dO SEOIHO MVI 0BE BLINS 'L3RXLS NIVN N LO0Z BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 12 legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint orally or in writing prior to the City's
13 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

14 26. The District has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior

15 provision of notice to the City indicating its intent to commence this action. The notice and proof

16 of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

17 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

18 27. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action
19 under the Code of Civil Procedure, the Public Resources Code, the Government Code, and all

20 other applicable statutes.

21 CEQA Statute of Limitations

22 28. Public Resources Code section 21167 provides that an action or proceeding

23 alleging that a public agency has not complied with CEQA shall be commenced within 30 days

24 from the filing of a valid Notice of Determination. If a valid Notice of Determination has not

25 been filed, Public Resources Code section 21167 provides that an action or proceeding alleging

26 that public agency has not complied with CEQA shall be commenced within 180 days from the

27 date of the public agency's decision to carry out or approve the project.

2 The a City filed a Notice of Determination relating to the Project on March 25,

3 2019. The District does not concede that this is necessarily a valid Notice of Determination
triggering a 30-day statute of limitations. The District intends to seek additional documents from

4 the City as part of the administrative record process in order to determine whether the Notice of

5 Determination filed by the City qualifies as a valid Notice of Determination.

9 L.P. (collectively, the "Parties") entered into an agreement to toll all applicable statutes of

10 limitations (the "Tolling Agreement") as of April 12, 2019- -eighteen (18) days after the City
filed its Notice of Determination on March 25, 2019.

dT1 3OHIX 8 1S38 1S98 390 11 31. The Tolling Agreement provided for the tolling of the statute of limitations for the

LAW OFFICES OI WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 LINS '1338.LS NIVWN N 400Z 12

13 period between April 12, 2019 and the "Termination Date;" the Tolling Agreement defined the

14 Termination Date as May 12, 2019, and the period between April 12, 2019 and the Termination
Date was known as the "Tolling Period.3

15 32. Because 18 days had already run when the Parties entered into the Tolling

16

17 Agreement, the Parties understood and agreed that the 30-day statute of limitations (if applicable)
would run for at least an additional twelve (12) days after the Termination Date set forth in the

18 Tolling Agreement.

19 33.

20 The Parties subsequently executed four amendments to the Tolling Agreement,

21 and each amendment, among other things, lengthened the Tolling Period by extending the
Termination Date set forth in the Tolling Agreement.

22 34.

23 The Fourth Amendment to the Tolling Agreement lengthened the Tolling Period

24 by extending the Termination Date set forth in the Tolling Agreement to July 16, 2019. In
particular, the Fourth Amendment to the Tolling Agreement provides:

25 The Parties agree to further lengthen the Tolling Period by

26 extending the Termination Date set forth in the Tolling

27 Agreement-as amended by the First, Second, and Third

28 Amendmentsto July 16, 2019.

35.

2 The Tolling Agreement, as amended by the Fourth Amendment to the Tolling
Agreement, thus provided for an uninterrupted Tolling Period between April 12, 2019 and July

4 16, 2019. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the Parties' Fourth Amendment to
the Tolling Agreement.

5 36.

6 The Parties understood and repeatedly agreed that the 30-day CEQA statute of

7 limitations (if applicable) would not run until at least twelve (12) days after the Termination

8 Datei.e., until at least 12 days after July 16, 2019. Communications among the Parties

9 confirmed this understanding and interpretation of the Tolling Agreement and the amendments

10 thereto. The Parties memorialized their understanding that the statute of limitations would not
run until at least 12 days after the Termination Date in the Third Amendment to the Tolling

LAW OFFICES OI N LO0Z MAIN STREET, SUI . 390 d71HHOBIUM 8 1S38 1S38 WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 11

12 Agreement and the Fourth Amendment to Tolling Agreement. In particular, the following

13 language was included in the Third Amendment to the Tolling Agreement and the Fourth

14 Amendment to the Tolling Agreement: "The Parties further agreed and understood that with the

15 expiration of the Second Amendment on May 31, 2019, the statute of limitations would continue

16 for an additional twelve days, through June 12, 2019.3 The Parties agreed and understood this

17 language to mean that the statute of limitations would not run until at least 12 days after the

18 Termination Date (the Termination Date was May 31, 2019 as amended by the Second

19 Amendment to the Tolling Agreement; June 18, 2019 as amended by the Third Amendment to the

20 Tolling Agreement, and July 16, 2019 as ultimately amended by the Fourth Amendment to the
Tolling Agreement.)

21 This understanding and interpretation was confirmed in multiple
communications between the Parties.

22 37.

23 The District had at least an additional twelve days after the July 16, 2019

24 Termination Date (i.e., until July 28, 2019) in the Fourth Amendment to the Tolling Agreement to

25 file a CEQA claim against the City and to challenge the City's certification of the EIR under

26 Public Resources Code section 21167. The City timely filed this action against the City on July

27 26, 2019. This action has thus been timely commenced pursuant to all applicable statutes.

28 38. Statute of Limitations re General Plan Inconsistency

4 plan should be commenced within 90 days of the legislative body's decision.

5 Here, the District timely filed its claim against the City alleging the Project's

6 inconsistency with the City's General Plan. Notably, via communication among the Parties, the

7 Parties agreed not only to extend the applicable CEQA statute of limitations, but all statute of

8 limitations relevant to the District's claims herein. In particular, and as set forth in the Fourth

9 Amendment to the Tolling Agreement (attached hereto as Exhibit B), the Parties agreed:
On April 12, 2019, the Parties entered into a tolling agreement
("Tolling Agreement") by which the Parties agreed to toll all

14 Parties that relates to (1) whether the City complied with CEQA

15 before issuing the Project Approvals, (2) the Project's consistency
with the City

16 of Riverbank General Plan 2005-2025, and

17 (3) affirmative defenses related thereto, such as the extent to which

18 the District adequately exhausted its administrative remedies to

19 challenge the Project's consistency with the City of Riverbank

General Plan 2005-2025.

40.

20

21 The Tolling Agreement, as amended by the Fourth Amendment to the Tolling

22 Agreement, thus explicitly provides that the Parties agreed to toll the relevant statute of

23 limitations governing the District's claim relating to the Project's consistency with the City of
Riverbank General Plan 2005-2025.

41.

24

25 The City approved the Project on March 19, 2019; the Parties entered into the

26 Tolling Agreement on April 12, 2019, twenty four (24) days after the City's approval. The

27 District thus had sixty-six (66) days-i.e., 90 days less 24 days-after the Termination Date to

28 timely file its claim relating to the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. As
discussed above, the Fourth Amendment to the Tolling Agreement amended the Tolling
Agreement to provide for an uninterrupted Tolling Agreement between April 12, 2019 and July - 10

2 claim relating to the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. By filing this action on

3 July 26, 2019, the District timely commenced this lawsuit within the time limits imposed under
all applicable statutes for each cause of action alleged herein, including the District's claim

5 relating to the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan.

7 42. The District seeks issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the City to vacate and set
aside its approvals relating to the Project. As discussed above, the Project contemplates, among

9 other things, development of the Subject Property with at least 2,452 residential units and 577,000

10 square feet of mixed uses. On or about March 19, 2019, the City issued variety of approvals for 969¥6 VINHO!ITVO '3380 LNNTVM D6E BLLINS 'L338LS NIVIN 2001 N. 11 the Project. More specifically, the District seeks issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the City dT140 30130 1R 8 1 830 S3O1dJ0 MVI 12 to set aside the City's approval for each of the following:
13 Resolution No 2019-013, Certifying an Environmental Impact Report (State

15 (CEQA) Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Mitigation

44.

2 The City approved the Project and issued the Approvals despite the District's

3 repeated comment letters regarding the Project. Before the City's approval, the District provided

4 the City with comment letters dated July 30, 2018, February 15, 2019, and March 19, 2019

5 (collectively, "Comment Letters"). The District is informed and believes, and on that basis

6 alleges, that other comment letters were also received by the City that identified deficiencies in
the EIR for the Project.

7 45.

8 The District's Comment Letters objected to the Project, outlined the inadequacies

9 of the City's Draft and Final BIRs for the Project, and explained that the Project is inconsistent
with the City's General Plan.

10 46.

d1183OJI8N 8 1838 1S38 390 WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 969‡6 11 For example, the District noted that, under CEQA, a project is presumed to have a

AW OFFICES OF nS 'LE3ULS NIVW 'N LOOZ 12 significant environmental impact where it would "[c]onflict with any applicable land use plan,
policy, or regulation of an agency

13 (including ... the general plan ...) adopted for the purpose

14 of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect." (See State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G,

15 Section X [Land Use and Planning].) The District explained, however, that the City failed to

16 reference any of the City's General Plan policies concerning fire hazards-e.g., City General Plan

17 Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5-in the EIR's discussion of whether this threshold of
significance is met. Notably, in its February 15, 2019 letter, the District wrote:

18

19 The Fire District thus again requests that the City comply with its
statutory obligation under CEQA to analyze and discuss the

20

21 Project's consistency with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1,

22 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Absent such analysis, the EIR is fatally
defective as a matter of law.

23 47.

24 Despite the District's repeated requests, the City dismissed the District's concerns

25 and objections. Rather than comply with the law, the City forged ahead with the Project.

48. The District incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 47, above, as though 12 -

set forth in full herein.

2 49. The District is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City

3 violated CEQA in numerous ways. The City's failure to comply with CEQA includes, but is not

4 limited to, the following:

5 50. Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Consistency with the General

6 Plan: Under CEQA, the City must prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR before

7 approving any discretionary project, such as the Project here, that may have a significant adverse

8 environmental effect. The EIR must fully disclose and analyze the Project's significant adverse

9 effects.

10 51. Among other impacts, the EIR must disclose and analyze whether the Project
068 ELLINS '1338IS NIVN N LOOZ d11 H393IUX 8 1S38 1S38 11 would "[c]onflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency ...

AW OFFICES LNNTVM CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 (including ... the general plan ...) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an

13 environmental effect." (See State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G, Section X [Land Use and

14 Planning].) Here, the EIR failed to disclose or analyze whether the Project would conflict with

15 the City's General Plan policies concerning fire hazards-e.g., City General Plan Policies

16 PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Those General Plan Policies are collectively entitled "Fire

17 Protection Services, Staffing, and Deployment Adequate to Serve the Needs of Existing and

18 Planned Development" and provide as follows:

19 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.1: The City will ensure that adequate fire flow pressure is
20 available in relation to structure size, design, requirements for construction, and/or built-in

21 fire protection systems. Maintenance of adequate fire flows includes factors such as

22 adequate storage, system gridding, hydrant spacing, and spacing and sizing of water
23 mains, as specified in the City's Water Master Plan.

24 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.2: For new development, the City will require minimum

25 fire flow pressure of 1,500 GPM (sustainable for at least two hours) for residential use.

26 For new development, the City will require a minimum fire flow pressure of

27 approximately 3,600 GPM (sustainable for longer periods) for larger residences and for

other building types, depending on the particular use and structure characteristics, and in

2 coordination with the fire service provider.

3 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.3: The City will require that fire stations be located to

4 ensure the appropriate level of service (including adequate response time per Policy

5 Public 7.5), community compatibility, and efficiency, including the location of such

6 facilities relative existing and planned public parks, libraries, and other activity centers.

7 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.4: The City will coordinate with fire protection providers,

8 including through reciprocity arrangements, to ensure equipment, staffing, and facilities

9 for emergency medical services, urban search and rescue, hazardous materials emergency

10 response, and other relevant needs, as appropriate. The City will ensure consistency with
0B& ELLINS '1338LS NIVW N HOOZ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 11 National Fire Protection Association and Stanislaus Consolidated Fire Protection District

10 S3O1J0 MVT 12 response requirements.

13 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.5: The City will coordinate with fire protection providers
14 to an emergency response system capable of achieving the following standards in 95% of

15 all cases: first fire emergency response unit within six minutes of dispatch; full alarm

16 assignment within 10 minutes of dispatch; second alarm assignment within 15 minutes of

17 dispatch; and an Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating of Class 2 for areas within the City.

18 52. The EIR fails to properly disclose and analyze whether the Project would conflict

19 with any of these general plan policies  a violation of CEQA. (See State CEQA Guidelines,

20 Appendix G, Section X [Land Use and Planning].)

21 53. Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Temporary Impacts: Under

22 CEQA, an EIR must analyze not only permanent impacts, but also temporary impacts resulting

23 from the Project (e.g., the Project's impacts during construction of the Project or impacts that

24 would occur before mitigation takes place.) Here, the City vaguely contemplated that a future fire

25 station would be required as a result of the Project, but the City failed to analyze whether the

26 Project would result in any temporary inconsistency with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC

27 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 while the Project is being implemented, but before the future fire station

28 vaguely contemplated in the EIR is fully operational. 14.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

•
1 54. In its February 15, 2019 letter, the District explained that the EIR is fatally flawed

2 because it fails to analyze the Project's temporary inconsistencies with City General Plan Policies

3 PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Despite the District's comments, the City refused to analyze

4 these temporary impacts of the Project.

5 55. Failure to Mitigate the Project's Impacts: Under CEQA, the City is required to

6 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to the Project, to adopt all feasible mitigation

7 measures and/or alternatives, and to determine that proposed mitigation measures will or will not

8 be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the Project's significant environmental impacts.

9 56. In its February 15, 2019 letter, the District informed the City that "the EIR must

10 require all feasible mitigation necessary to ensure the Project's consistency with City General

11 Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 both before and after the future fire station's
d0 SHOIJO MV1 8SSS MINNOHTNB RN N LOOZ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 12 construction." Nevertheless, the City approved a Project inconsistent with the City's General

13 Plan, and it did nothing to mitigate the Project's inconsistency with City General Plan Policies

14 PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5.

15 57. In short, the City has statutory obligations under CEQA to analyze whether the

16 Project is consistent with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5, and if is

17 not consistent, to adopt mitigation measures to ensure consistency. The City approved the Project

18 and issued the Approvals without satisfying either of these obligations under CEQA. Moreover,

19 to the extent the City found the Project consistent with the aforementioned General Plan Policies,

20 the City's finding and determination was not supported by substantial evidence as required by

21 CEQA. The District thus requests the Court issue writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside

22 its Approvals and to comply with CEQA.

23 58. Attorneys' Fees: The District has had to employ attorneys to bring this litigation.

24 Furthermore, the District has incurred and will incur substantial attorneys' fees and litigation

25 costs because of the City's and Respondents' unlawful acts. This litigation, if successful, will

26 result in enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest. Such enforcement will

27 confer a significant benefit on a large a class of persons. The District is entitled to be reimbursed

28 for its attorneys' fees and costs because a it is functioning as a private attorney general pursuant to • 15 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The District is also entitled to attorneys' fees and
2 costs pursuant to Section 800 of the Government Code.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Inconsistency with the City's General Plan)

5 59. The District hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1

6 through 58 as though fully set forth herein.

7 60. The Project approved by is the City is inconsistent with the City of Riverbank

8 General Plan 2005 - 2025 ("General Plan") in violation of California's Planning and Zoning Law

9 and the City's Code of Ordinances, among other laws. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, § 65000, et seq.;

10 City of Riverbank Code of Ordinances, § 150.31 ["The General Plan establishes that land
068 BLINS '1338.1S NIVW N HOOZ d118303I8X 8 1S38 1S38 WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 94596 11 development shall not be permitted unless adequate capital facilities and/or infrastructure exist or
LAW OFFICES OF 12 are assured"].) Alternatively, the City approved the Project based on a finding that the Project is
13 consistent with the General Plan, but that finding is not supported by substantial evidence.

14 61. "The propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development
15 depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements.» (Families Unafraid

16 to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. El Dorado County Bd. of Sup'rs (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th
17 1332, 1336.) A project's "inconsistency with simply one general plan policy" may thus "be

18 enough to scuttle a project." (Id. at p. 1341; Spring Valley Lake Assn. v. City of Victorville (2016)

19 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 100-101 [project deemed inconsistent with general plan where it conflicted

20 with just one general plan policy].)

21 62. Here, the Project is inconsistent with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2,

22 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Notably, the Project would result in inadequate fire protection services, staffing,

23 and deployment adequate to serve the needs of existing and planned development. Consistency

24 with these policies is necessary and essential to the safety of the City's residents.

25 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Declaratory Relief - against all Respondents/Defendants)
27 63. The District hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1
28 through 62 as though fully set forth herein. - 16 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

64. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the District and the City.

2 The District contends that the City has not complied with the provisions of CEQA in certifying

3 the EIR and approving the Project. Moreover, the District contends that the Project is
inconsistent with the City's General Plan. The District believes that the Project will cause

5 irreparable injury for which the District has no adequate remedy at law and will have significant

6 adverse effects on the environment.

7 65. The District is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City

8 disputes the contentions of the District as described in the immediately preceding paragraph.

9 66. The District seeks a judicial declaration and determination that the City must abide

10 by its duties and,obligations under CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and the City's own 969+6 VINHOJITVO 'M33O1NNTVM D6E ELLINS 'I3EHLS NIVW V LOOZ 11 ordinances and regulations.
LAW OFFICES OF d77 8353I8N 9 1S38 1S38 12 67. A judicial declaration and determination is necessary and appropriate at this time
13 in order that the District may ascertain its rights with respect to the duties and obligations of the

14 City and in order to resolve all controversies between the parties hereto regarding such rights and

15 duties.

16 68. The District asks this Court for an award of attorney's fees and costs against the

17 City as permitted or required by law.

PRAYER 18

19 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, the District respectfully prays for the following relief

20 against the City, Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and any and all other parties who may

FOURTH AMENDMENT TO TOLLING AGREEMENT
This Fourth Amendment to Tolling Agreement ("Fourth Amendment") is entered into and shall be deemed effective as of June 27, 2019 (the "Effective Date") by and between WESTERN PACIFIC HOLDINGS, INC.; HARRIGFELD FAMILY; MACHADO FAMILY: MCGRANE LIVING TRUST; BROWMAN DEVELOPMENT COMPANY INC.; BOSIO 2003 FAMILY L.P. (collectively, "Real Parties in Interest"), the CITY OF RIVERBANK, a California municipal corporation ("City"), and STANISLAUS CONSOLIDATED FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT, a California fire protection distriot ("District"). The City, District, and Real Parties in Interest may be referred to herein individually as a "Party" or collectively as the "Parties."

RECITALS

The Parties agree to this Fourth Amendment with reference to the following facts:

A. On March 19, 2019, the City Council for the City of Riverbank ("City Council") adopted (1) Resolution No. 2019-013, certifying the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") for the Crossroads West Specific Pian ("CWSP" or "Project"), State Clearinghouse No, 2017032062, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub, Res.
