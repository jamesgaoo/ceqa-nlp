21 Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice (*Petitioner") hereby give

22 notice under Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 of the Verified First Amended Petition filed January 21,

23 2020 ("FAP"), attached hereto as Exhibit A, involving a California Environmental Quality Act

24 ("CEQA") Petition initially filed July 26, 2019.

25 The FAP challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Commerce ("City") in approving a

26 24-hour, 7-Eleven convenience store and gas station ("Project") at 2425 S. Atlantic Blvd. in

27 Commerce, California just a few feet from single-family residences. Specifically, on May 7,

28
-|-

NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

2019, the City approved the Project's conditional use permit and two variances (collectively

. 2 "Entitlements") absent any CEQA review whatsoever or having Project-related Health Risk

3 Assessment ("HRA") as required under the Commerce Municipal Code ("Code"). Thereafter, in
December 2019, and after Petitioner filed its lawsuit, the City adopted a resolution finding the
Project was categorically exempt from CEQA under four classes of exemptions ("Categorical

6 Exemption") without having the Code-required HRA (as pointed out by Petitioner's

7 environmental expert comments), relying on a ten-page traffic study riddled with flaws (as
pointed out by Petitioner's traffic expert comments), and absent substantial evidence. At a

9 minimum, the City was required to prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration to consider and

10 weigh the adequacy of proposed mitigation measures for the Project.

11 Petitioner respectfully urges the Attorney General to review the FAP given it raises

12 significant issues regarding the City's improper pre-commitment to approve the Project absent
13 CEQA review in May 2019, and the City's post hoc justification in December 2019 with its

14 adoption of the Project's Categorical Exemptions absent substantial evidence.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. By this First Amended Petition ("FAP"), amended by right pursuant to Code Civ.

3 Proc. § 472(a), Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice ("Eastyard" or

4 "Petitioner") challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Commerce and its agents (collectively

5 "City" or "Respondent") in approving the construction and use of a 24-hour, 7-Eleven

6 convenience store and gas station ("Project*) on a 20,395 square-foot ("SF") lot at the

7 intersection of S. Atlantic Boulevard and Washington Boulevard in the City of Commerce,

8 a California ("Site"), just a few feet from single-family residences. This Amended Petition amends

9 the original Petition filed July 26, 2019.

10 2. Specifically, Petitioner challenges the City's granting of Conditional Use Permit

11 No. 528 to allow a convenience store with gasoline sales on the Site ("CUP"), and Variance No.

12 18-01 to allow two variances from the Commerce Municipal Code ("CMC" or "Code") requiring

13 the Project to be located on a minimum 25,000-SF lot and a minimum of 300 feet from property

14 zoned for residential uses ("Variances"). Despite the City Planning Commission denying the

15 CUP and Variances (collectively "Entitlements") because the Project could not satisfy 14 of the

16 15 Code-required land use findings, the City Council approved the Entitlements in May 2019

17 absent a Code-required health risk assessment ("HRA"), absent any proposed findings of fact or

18 discussion of legally relevant facts, and absent any review under the California Environmental

19 Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code $ 21000 et seq., ("CEQA"). Thereafter, in December 2017, and after

20 Petitioner filed this lawsuit, the City adopted a resolution finding the Project was categorically

21 exempt from CEQA under four classes of exemptions ("Categorical Exemption") and made a

22 180-degree turnaround on the Code-required findings for the Entitlements (collectively " Adopted

23 Findings") none of the findings were supported by substantial evidence. At a minimum, the

24 City was required to prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") to consider and weigh

25 the adequacy of proposed mitigation measures for the Project. Furthermore, throughout 2019,

26 Petitioner submitted numerous requests pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Gov. Code

27 6250 et seq. ("CPRA") to access public documents concerning the Project's compliance with

28 -2-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 State and local zoning/CEQA requirements, which the City repeatedly refused to promptly
N disclose-prejudicing Petitioner's fair opportunity to present its case at the December 2019

3 hearing. Relevant documents were not timely produced before that hearing, and in fact, many
still have not been produced as of the filing of this FAP.
n 3. Petitioner seeks, among other things, that this Court invalidate the Project's

6 Entitlements, Categorical Exemption, and Adopted Findings (collectively "Project Approvals")

7 until the City satisfies the procedural and substantive requirements under applicable State/local

8 zoning laws, CEQA, and the CPRA.

9 JURISDICTION

10 4. This Court has jurisdiction under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 1085-1087, 1094.5 and/or

11 1094.6 (i.e., mandamus actions); Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5 (i.e., CEQA actions); Code

12 Civ. Proc. § 1085, Gov. Code §§ 6258 and 6259, and Art. 6 § 10 of the Cal. Const. (i.e., CPRA

13 actions); and Code Civ. Proc §§ 526-527 and 1060 (i.e., injunctive/declaratory relief). Venue is

14 proper in this Court because the parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County

15 with the City responsible for the Project's compliance with applicable State/local zoning laws,

16 served as the lead agency under CEQA, and the agency in possession of public records to which

17 Petitioner have a right to access under the CPRA. Additionally, the within action has been timely

18 brought within 90 days of the City's granting of the Entitlements and other Project Approvals

19 pursuant to Gov. Code 65009. Furthermore, because Petitioner is unaware of any properly filed

20 CEQA Notice of Exemption ("NOE"), the within action is timely brought within 180 days after

21 the City's adoption of the Categorical Exemption per Pub. Res. Code § 21167 and 14 Cal. Code

22 Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15112. Petitioner served a Notice of Intent to File its original

23 Petition on the City Clerk pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by mail on July 25, 2019, as

24 reflected in Exhibit A attached hereto. Concurrent with the filing of this FAP, Petitioner will

25 timely notify the Attorney General of the State of California of the filing of the FAP, in

26 accordance with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 PARTIES

2 5. Petitioner East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice ("Eastyard" or

A "Petitioner") is a non-profit corporation with its headquarters at 2317 Atlantic Boulevard,

5 Commerce California 90040 less than a quarter-mile from the Project Site whose members
include affected individuals who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this FAP.

6

7 Eastyard was established in 2001 by residents of the Commerce/East Los Angeles area who were

8 concerned with the increasing environmental health impacts of industrial pollution in their

9 community, as well as several pending expansion projects adjacent to homes, schools and parks.

10 Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development in the I-710 corridor

11 and informed decision-making by public officials in Commerce concerning consistency with

12 development regulations in the City and for the Site. Eastyard, through its representatives and

13 members (i.e., Mark Lopez, Cindy Donis, Laura Cortez, Jocelyn Del Real, Maria Becerra),

14 submitted verbally and written comments before the City at multiple public hearings held on the

15 Project, such as Planning Commission hearings held in 2018 and Council hearings held in 2019.

6.

16 Respondent City of Commerce ("City" or "Respondent") is a general law city

17 organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California and located in the

18 County of Los Angeles, California that permits the Project and serves, via its sub-agents, as lead

19 agency for the Project's compliance with CEQA. So too, the Respondent is a local public agency

20 within the meaning of Gov. Code § 6252(d) and is believed to be in possession of records sought
by this FAP.

21 7.

22 Real Party in Interest business entities Elliot Megdal & Associates and Megdal

23 Commerce, LLC and individual Taylor Megdal (collectively "Applicant" or "Real Party") are

24 believed to be businesses and/or individuals domiciled and operating in Los Angeles County and
recipients of the Project Approvals.

25 8.

26 The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

27 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who,

28 -4-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 therefore, sues said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

3 FAP to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

9.

4 Petitioner, individually and through its members, objected to the Project Approvals

Un orally, in writing, and/or by filling speaker cards during the public comment period before the

6 close of the Project's public hearing. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies, the

7 City's determinations are final, and no further administrative appeals are available under State or

8 local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this FAP were sufficiently raised and

9 disputed with the City before the Project Approvals were finally approved. The City was given

10 notice and the opportunity to act in compliance with CEQA, the CMC, and other applicable laws
but failed to do so.

11 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

12 10.

13 Project: The Project includes the demolition of a drive-through restaurant

14 structure (i.e., Church's Chicken) that has been vacant for at least three years, and the

15 construction/use of a 24-hour, 7-Eleven convenience store with a four-pump fueling station on a

16 20,395-SF Site zoned commercial/manufacturing ("C/M-1") adjacent to a single-family

17 residential zoned community as close as 20-100 feet from residential uses. To this end, the
Project requires the following Entitlements:

18

19 One Conditional Use Permit (i.e., CUP No. 528) to allow a convenience store with

20 gasoline sales on the C/M-1 zoned Site pursuant to CMC §§ 19.11.030.A, 19.31.400.A;

and

21

22 Two Variances (i.e., Variance No. 18-01) from CMC § 19.31.400.B that requires the

23 combination of a service station and mini-market "must" be a) located on a parcel at least

24 25,000 SF and b) located a minimum of 300 feet from property zoned for residential uses.
11.

25 Planning Commission Denial of the Project (Oct. - Nov. 2018): Between

26 October and November 2018, the City Planning Commission held multiple public hearings on the

27 Project where City staff recommended denial of the Entitlements. Staff expressed numerous

28 concerns with the Project, such as: the building location/orientation would conflict with Code

-5-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•

1 requirements concerning building design; two new curb cuts would cause additional traffic

2 congestion and possible turning hazards; and that the Project did not qualify for a Class 32 In-Fill
categorical exemption because it conflicted with the Zoning Code (i.e., deviating from 25,000-SF

4 lot and 300-foot buffer requirements). On November 28, 2018, the Planning Commission

5 unanimously agreed with staff's recommendation to deny the Entitlements, in part, because the

6 Commission could not make nine of the ten CUP findings (per CMC § 19.39.420.A) or any of

7 the five findings required for the Variances (per CMC § 19.39.510), including findings no. 1-5

8 and 7-15 summarized below:

9 Finding 1: The proposed use is one conditionally permitted within the subject zone and

10 complies with the intent of all applicable provisions of the Zoning Code;

11 Finding 2: The proposed use would not impair the integrity and character of the zone in
12 which it is to be located;

13 Finding 3: The subject site is physically suitable for the type of land use being proposed;

14 Finding 4: The proposed use is compatible with the land uses presently on the property;

15 Finding 5: The proposed use would be compatible with existing and future land uses

16 within the zone and the general area in which the proposed use is to be located;

17 Finding 6: There would be adequate provisions for water, sanitation, and public utilities

18 and services and would not be detrimental to public health and safety;

19 Finding 7: There would be adequate provisions for public access to serve the proposal;

20 Finding 8: The proposed use is consistent with the objectives, policies, general land uses,

21 and programs of the general plan;

22 Finding 9: The proposed use would not be detrimental to the public interest, health,

23 safety, convenience, or welfare;

24 Finding 10: The proposed design and elevations preserve and maximize the image,

25 character, and visual quality of the neighborhood;

26 Finding 11: That the strict or literal interpretation and application of the Zoning Code

27 would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general

28 -6-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

N purpose and intent of this Zoning Code, or would deprive applicants of privileges granted
to others in similar circumstances;
3

4 Finding 12: That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions

5 applicable to the property involved or the intended development of the property that do
not apply generally to other property in the same zone;

6

7 Finding 13: That the granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of a special

8 privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity classified in
the same zone;

9

10 Finding 14: That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the

11 public health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the

12 zone or neighborhood in which the property is located; and

13 Finding 15: That the granting of such variance will not create any inconsistency with any
objective contained in the general plan.

14 12.

15 Moreover, the City admittedly did not prepare an initial environmental study
pursuant to CEQA or any CEQA clearance.

16 13.

17 Appeal & Council Approval of the Entitlements (Dec. - May 2019): In

18 February 2019, the City Council accepted an appeal of the Planning Commission's denial of the

19 Project Entitlements ("Appeal"). Between April and May 2019, the Appeal appeared on multiple

20 City Council agendas where Eastyard members and other nearby stakeholders appeared and urged

21 Council to deny the Appeal and sustain the Planning Commission's decision, in part, because the

22 City could not make the Code-required findings and concerns regarding the Project's

23 environmental impacts on nearby residents and the surrounding area. These concerns were

24 echoed by a City Planning Commissioner who testified before the City Council about the

25 Project's inconsistency with applicable zoning laws and explicitly requested the Project not be

26 approved under CEQA via a categorical exemption. Furthermore, leading up to Council's final

27 action, City staff repeatedly raised concerns about increased traffic and driving hazards caused by

28 the Project and confirmed that no traffic study or other CEQA documentation had been prepared

-7.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 showing impacts would be less than significant. Notwithstanding these concerns, or the lack of

3 any environmental review, or any legally relevant discussion regarding the Code-required

4 findings, the City Council voted 3-1 to grant the Appeal and approve ? the Entitlements on May 7,

5 2019, and directed staff to prepare a resolution including the findings of fact and the requisite
environmental review for the City Council's consideration. At that meeting, the Council granted

6 the Appeal and approved the Entitlements with zero CEQA analysis and based on factors

7 unrelated to the Code-required findings (e.g., the City's need to 'bait the line' to encourage

8 economic development and increase tax revenue from gas sales).

9 14.

10 Petitioner's Lawsuit (Jul. 2019): On July 26, 2019, Petitioner filed its initial

11 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate challenging the City's May 7, 2019 granting of the Appeal

12 and approval of the Entitlements, in particular alleging that the Appeal had been granted and
Entitlements approved with no CEQA evaluation.

13 15.

14 Public Records Act Requests (May - Dec. 2019): Petitioner submitted CPRA

15 requests to the City in May, July, August, and November of 2019each asking explicitly for

16 emails and CEQA documents in connection with the Project. By December 5, 2019, the City had

17 provided minimal documents and a handful of old emails, informed Petitioner that the City had

18 no "CEQA document" in its possession, and that it had withheld approximately 30 emails under

19 various privileges and exemptions. On December 13th, after yet another request by Petitioner for

20 said traffic study, the City finally provided Petitioner with the Project's ten-page Traffic Impact

21 Analysis ("TIA") dated October 28, 2019seemingly prepared between three and six weeks

22 before Petitioner's November 21st and December 9th CPRA requests (respectively).2

16. As of the date of this FAP, Petitioner has received no emails from the entire Year

23

24 2019 related to the Project, nor any facts demonstrating how the claimed privileges/exemptions
apply to records requested.

25

26 As confirmed by the City's own Adopted Findings approved in December 2019.

27 2 On Friday December 13, 2019 (four days before the final December 17, 2019 Project hearing),

28 the City finally provided Petitioner the key TIA for the Project. It appears the City prejudicially sat on the TIA for more than six weeks before producing it.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 17. Post Hoc Approval of Categorical Exemption & Adoption of Findings (Dec.

2 2019): On December 17, 2019, more than four months after Petitioner sued demanding a CEQA

3 analysis, the City considered the Adopted Findings to post hoc justify the City's May approval of
ü p 00 -J O the Entitlements, including new findings that the Project was categorically exempt from CEQA
under the following classes of exemptions:
Class 2 Exemption for replacement or reconstruction of existing structures (see CEQA
Guidelines § 15302);
Class 3 Exemption for the new construction or conversion of small structures (id., §

9 15303);

10 Class 5 Exemption for minor alterations in land use limitations (id., § 15305); and

11 Class 32 Exemption for infill development projects (id., § 15332).

12 18. At the hearing, Petitioner submitted detailed comments-including two comment

13 letters from traffic and environmental experts-showing the Project failed to provide the Code-

14 required Health Risk Assessment on gas station impacts for the neighbors just feet away, did not

15 fall within any of the classes of CEQA exemptions, had significant traffic impacts, and that the

16 Adopted Findings lacked substantial evidence. Nevertheless, by a vote of 3-1, the City Council

17 approved the Categorical Exemption and Adopted Findings. Any reasonable person attending the

18 meeting or reviewing the meeting video/documents would conclude that the Council's action was

19 premised on the fact that it felt it had already granted the Appeal and approved the Project in May

20 2019.

21 19. The record is void of any specific facts or credible evidence to support the granting

22 of the Project Approvals. This lack of substantial evidence, in addition to the Council's own

23 statements, speaks volumes what this case is all about-baiting the line for economic

24 development, State/local law be damned.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Zoning Violations; Failure to Proceed in Manner Required by Law; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

3 20. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-19 as if fully set forth herein.

4 21. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that the City failed to proceed in a

5 manner required by law when it granted the Appeal and approved the Entitlements in May 2019

6 and adopted the Adopted Findings in December 2019 without a complete HRA submitted in

7 conjunction with the Project application. The plain language of the City Code states that

8 businesses involving the storage and transfer of hazardous materials and subject to South Coast

9 Air Quality Management District (*SCAQMD") regulation, such as the Project here, "shall be

10 required to complete and submit to the community development director, in conjunction with

11 any application authorized by this [Zoning Code], a health risk assessment that identifies the

12 chemicals or materials to be used and the potential risk to public health associated with the

13 hazardous materials associated with the proposed business or operation." CMC § 19.11.070,

14 emph. added. Petitioner is informed and believes that no such HRA has ever been prepared and

15 completed to date, much less submitted in conjunction with the Project application for the CUP

16 and Variances. This amounts to an abuse of discretion by the City failing to proceed in a manner a

17 required by law, which is a fatal flaw to the granting of the Project Approvals for a gas station a

18 few dozen feet from single-family residences.

19 22. An HRA is intended to estimate the human health and cancer risks associated with

20 hazardous operations, such as the case here where the gas station will operate approximately 20-

21 100 feet from residents and within 500 fect of school property and, thus, is a Project subject to

22 SCAQMD Rule 1401 and 1401.1. Absent this Code-required HRA, neither the City nor the

23 public had an opportunity to consider the potential impacts suffered by this environmental justice

24 community, or publicly vet the adequacy of any additional measures needed to protect the nearby

25 residents due to their proximity to the Site.

26 23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

27 sought in this FAP. Petitioner has public interest standing to ensure the City faithful execute a

28 -10-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 public duty, including the duty to grant land use approvals only when following Code-required

2 procedures. If the City does not revoke the Project Approvals and allow the development of the

3 Project, Petitioner, its members, and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which there is

4 no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence, and significant

5 adverse impacts occur contrary to State and local law.

6
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
7 (Zoning Violations; Inadequate Land Use Findings; Abuse of Discretion and Lack
Substantial Evidence; 8 CCP § 1094.5)

9 24. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-23 as if fully set forth herein.

10 25. An agency abuses its discretion where its land use decision is not supported by the

11 findings, or the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

12 See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5 subds., (b) & (c). Findings are the "legally relevant sub-

13 conclusions" that supports the agency's action, which bridges the "analytic gap between the raw

14 evidence and ultimate decision" of the decision-maker, and directs the "the reviewing court's

15 attention to the analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action."

16 Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515-516

17 ("Topanga"), emph. added. Among other things, legally relevant findings serve to "minimize the

18 likelihood that the agency will randomly leap" from evidence to action; "enable the reviewing

19 court to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis[;]" while also serving as "a public

20 relations function by helping to persuade the parties that administrative decision-making is

21 careful, reasoned, and equitable." Id. at 516-517, emph. added.

22 26. In zoning actions challenging the adequacy of the an agency's findings, judicial

23 review is "vigorous and meaningful" to ensure the agency fulfill its decision-making labor,

24 protect the interests of neighbors of the property at issue, prevent unjustified variance that

25 subverts the critical reciprocity upon which zoning regulation rests, and thwart against the

26 regulatory capture of zoning boards under threat by the undue influence from land use

27 lobbyist/expediters and the applicants they serve. Id. at 517-518; see also Stolman V. City of Los

28 -11-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Angeles (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 923 ("Stolman") ("Topanga makes it clear that despite the

2 applicability of the substantial evidence rule and the deference due to the administrative findings

3 and decision, judicial review of zoning variances must not be perfunctory or mechanically

4 superficial." Italics original, internal quotes omitted).

5 27. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that the City's May 2019 granting of the

6 Appeal and approval of the Entitlements were not supported by any findings, much less supported

7 by substantial evidence, nor premised on legally relevant factors required under CMC §§

8 19.39.420.A, 19.39.510 (i.e., the 15 CUP/Variance findings). Nor were the post hoc Adopted

Q Findings adopted in December 2019 supported by substantial evidence - they are instead replete

10 with boilerplate and conclusory statements, and void of relevant facts and analysis that explain

11 how the City was able to make a 180-degree U-turn on 14 of 15 findings that the City Planning

12 Commission had previously determined could not be made.

13 28. For example, for finding no. 11 (i.e., unnecessary hardship), the Adopted Findings

14 fail to evidence any financial hardship, much less adequate financial hardship beyond profit-

15 maximization; nor provide the specific facts of any similarly situated property in the vicinity

16 enjoying the same privilege sought under the Entitlements (i.e., operating under the 25,000-SF lot

17 requirement and within 300 feet of residential uses). This amounts to conclusory, boilerplate

18 recitation to the Code-required findings void of any concrete details.

19 29. For finding no. 13 (i.e., special privilege), the Adopted Findings fail to identify a

20 station on lots single property that is allowed by-right to operate a convenience store with a gas

21 less than 25,000 SF and less than 300 feet of residential uses. Nor do the Adopted Findings

22 address how granting of the Variances would not be a special privilege for the Site when

23 compared to the gas station/convenience store business a mere block away from the Site

24 ostensibly abiding by the 300-foot buffer requirement. The Adopted Findings fail utterly to

25 provide any data of legal significance that address the specific criteria under the Code.

L 30.

2 For finding no. 12 (i.e., exceptional/extraordinary circumstances), the Planning

3 Commission found that the Site was regularly shaped and was not prevented from being

4 developed for other uses, such as by-right convenience store without a gas station component.

5 Yet, the Adopted Findings make a 180-degree about-face stating the Site was inhibited from

6 being developed for other commercial uses (which is facially erroneous) because it was located

on

7 a corner lot (which is commonplace generally and here specifically) and subject to prior street

8 dedications like other lots near the Site (which is admittedly not unique for the area). These

9 justifications are not only self-contradicting but also amount to non sequitur arguments lacking
legal significance.

10 31.

11 For findings nos. 1 (i.e., compliance with all applicable zoning provisions), 3 (i.e.,

12 site physically suitable for proposed land use), and 5 (i.e., use compatible with existing and future

13 uses within the general area), the Planning Commission determined that these finding could not

14 be made because, among other things, the Project failed to meet the plain language of the 25,000-

15 SF lot area and 300-foot buffer Code requirements, and that the area was already adequately

16 served by four 7-Elevens and 14 gas stations (ten with convenience stores) within 1.5 miles of the

17 Site. Yet, the Adopted Findings make a 180-degree reversal on these findings claiming

18 unspecified conditions would purportedly protect nearby residence (which is ambiguous at best),

19 while also claiming surrounding buildings are utilized for commercial manufacturing uses (which

20 is facially inaccurate), and claiming the Project provides a necessity without altering existing

21 impacts to residents (again, facially wrong based on City's own evidence). So too, the Adopted

22 Findings claim the Project is consistent with applicable zoning provisions to grant the CUP upon

23 the pre-determined approval of the Variances, which is a circular argument that places the a

24 proverbial cart before the horse. No reasonable person could conclude the Project is consistent

25 with the City's zoning provision after reading the plain language of the Code and looking at the
location of nearby residents.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 32. Petitioner and its members live, work, and recreate in close proximity to the Site

2 and will suffer from air quality and traffic impacts from the Project, the very type of interest

3 served and protected under the Code. So too, Petitioner has public interest standing to ensure the

4 City faithful execute a public duty, including the duty to grant conditional use permits and

5 variances only when the City can make the Code-required legal findings supported by substantial

6 evidence.

7 33. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

8 sought in this FAP. If the City does not revoke the Project Approvals and allows the
development of the Project, Petitioner, its members, and the public will suffer irreparable harm

10 from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations

11 commence, and significant adverse impacts occur contrary to State and local law.

12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (CEQA Violations; Improper Pre-Commitment to Project Approval; Failure to Proceed in Manner Required by Law; Abuse of Discretion and Lack Substantial Evidence; CCP §
14 1094.5)

15 34. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-33, as if fully set forth herein.

16 35. CEQA review must be done "before" a lead agency grants its approval of a

17 project. CEQA Guidelines § 15004(a), emph. added; see also Laurel Heights Improvement Assn.

18 V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394 ("A fundamental purpose of an

19 EIR is to provide decision makers with information they can use in deciding whether to approve a

20 proposed project, not to inform them of the environmental effects of projects that they have

21 already approved. If postapproval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely

22 become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to support action already taken." Emph.

23 original).

24 36. To serve its basic purpose and prevent environmental reviews from becoming post

25 hoc rationalizations, CEQA bars an agency from pre-committing to project approval until the

26 agency has conducted an adequate CEQA review. For private projects, ". approval occurs upon

27 the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract,

28 -14-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 grant, subsidy, loan, or other form of financial assistance, lease, permit, license, certificate, or

2 other entitlement for use of the project." CEQA Guidelines 15352, emph. added. Numerous

3 agency actions have been deemed improper pre-commitment to project approval when they

4 committed the agency to a definite course of action regarding the project. See e.g., Save Tara v.
w City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 139 (held approval of development agreement
6 was a project approval when considering public announcements to proceed with the project,

7 relocated tenants, provided financial assistance, and agreed to convey property once City
g Manager decided "all applicable CEQA requirements" had been satisfied); RiverWatch v.
Olivenhain Mun. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186 (water district's contract to deliver

10 recycled water to landfill project, which envisioned future CEQA compliance, was a project

11 approval because it failed to reserve agency discretion to disapprove agreement or require

12 mitigation measures or alternatives after the EIR was completed).

13 37. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that the City granted the Appeal and

14 approved the Entitlements in May 2019 absent any CEQA review. All indicia, including the

15 City's own staff report and Adopted Findings, make clear that the City granted Appellant's

16 Appeal and approved the Entitlements in May 2019improperly leaving the post hoc

17 rationalization of undertaking the CEQA review and approving the Adopted Findings only after

18 Petitioner filed this lawsuit. In December 2019, when the City Council approved the Adopted

19 Findings, the members of the Council thought the Project had already been approved, and the

20 staff report for the hearing confirmed this.

21 38. In sum, the City committed itself to the Project when it granted the Appeal and

22 approved the Entitlements in May 2019 with no CEQA review whatsoever. The subsequent

23 CEQA review with a mishmash of inapplicable CEQA exemptions, a mere ten-page TIA, and no

24 HRA-undertaken only after Petitioner sued-merely served as a post hoc rationalization to

25 superficially justify the City's definitive course of action to approve the Project Approvals taken

26 in May 2019. This constitutes improper pre-commitment under CEQA.

1 39. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

public duty, including the duty to conduct adequate CEQA review before, not after, approving

4 projects.

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (CEQA Violations; Inadequate Findings; Abuse of Discretion and Lack Substantial Evidence; CCP § 1094.5)

40. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-39, as if fully set forth herein.

41. CEQA provides categorical exemptions for projects that are unlikely to have
9
environmental impacts. See Pub. Res. Code § 21084. In actions challenging an agency's use of a
10

11 categorical exemption, the agency's factual determinations are subject to the substantial evidence
test, which includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinions
12
supported by facts. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(5),
13
15384. Nevertheless, courts apply the rule that categorical exemptions are to be construed
14

15 narrowly and are not to be expanded beyond the scope of their plain language. See Castaic Lake

16 Water Agency v. City of Santa Clarita (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 1257; see also Wildlife Alive v.

17 Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205.

42. However, categorical exemptions are improper where exceptions to the
18

19 exemptions apply (e.g., cumulative impacts, unusual circumstances, etc.). See CEQA Guidelines
§ 15300.2; see also Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086,
20

21 1105. So too, categorical exemptions may not rely on project-specific mitigation measures or
minor steps taken to avoid a more demanding CEQA review. See Salmon Protection &
22
Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102, 1108 ("Reliance
23 upon mitigation measures (whether included in the application or later adopted) involves an
24
evaluative process of assessing those mitigation measures and weighing them against potential
25
environmental impacts, and that process must be conducted under established CEQA standards
26

27 and procedures for EIR'S or negative declarations." Emph. added); see also Azusa Land

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200

2 (observing CEQA Guidelines do not authorize consideration of mitigation measures with the

3 categorical exemption and that the project required at a minimum an MND).

4 43. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that the City's reliance on any categorical

5 exemption is improper. First, after its May 2019 approval of the Entitlements but before its

6 December 2019 approval of the Categorical Exemption, the City purportedly crafted key

7 mitigation measures to address concerns with the Project, such as the 'No Left-In' and 'No Left-

8 Out' traffic sign to address concerns with the Project's traffic circulation. This is a Project-

9 specific mitigation measure, albeit inadequate and not tethered to a properly prepared traffic study

10 (as pointed out in Petitioner's expert traffic comment letter), and could only be imposed pursuant

11 to the evaluation process involved in a more demanding CEQA-review (such as an MND where

12 mitigation measures can be adequately considered and weighed via the public-vetting process).

13 This is a fatal flaw to the City's use of a categorical exemption here. At a minimum, an MND

14 was necessary.

15 44. Second, the City failed to provide substantial evidence that the Project falls within

16 the plain language of the narrowly-construed classes of relied-on CEQA exemptions. For

17 example, the Project does not qualify under a Class 2 Exemption (i.e., replacement/reconstruction

18 of existing structures) because the proposed 7-Eleven gas station is fundamentally different from

19 the former Church's Chicken restaurant (e.g., hours of operation, circulation, traffic generation,

20 hazardous risk, etc.). Nor does the Project qualify under a Class 3 Exemption (i.e., new

21 construction or conversion of small structures) because the Project includes hazardous materials

22 and no Code-required HRA was provided demonstrating the amount of hazardous materials is not

23 considerable given the context of the surrounding area (as pointed out in environmental expert

24 comment letter). Nor does the Project qualify under a Class 5 Exemption (i.e., minor land use

25 alterations) when the Code makes clear that only "modifications" are considered "minor" and

26

27

28 -17-

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 only under limited circumstances (see CMC §§ 19.45.140, 19.39.560),3 none of which applied to

2 the Project that required two Variances for major deviations from the Code-required 25,000-SF

3 lot and 300-foot buffer requirements*- thus, the Project was not considered a "modification" or

4 "minor" land use alteration under the Code or CEQA. Nor does the Project qualify under a Class

5 32 Exemption (i.e., infill development) because the Project is inconsistent with zoning regulations

6 (i.e., requiring a CUP and two Variances), no Code-required HRA or noise study was provided

7 (i.e., showing no air quality or noise impacts), and the ten-page TIA was riddled with numerous

8 flaws (e.g., failing to provide any meaningful analysis of the Project's traffic impacts).

9 45. Third, the City failed to provide substantial evidence that the Project does not

10 involve cumulative impacts because no Code-required HRA was provided to assess Project-

11 specific impacts within the context of the impacts from the various other industrial/manufacturing

12 operations in the area, which cumulatively have a disparate effect on this well-known

13 environmental justice community. So too, the City fails to provide substantial evidence that the

14 Project does not involve unusual circumstances when the City fails to address the rarity of siting a

15 gas station in such close proximity to residential uses, in a unique environmental justice a

16 community, and at an exceptionally congested intersection.

17 46. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

18 sought in this FAP. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approval and allow the

19 development of the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which

20 there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence, and

21 significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law. So

22 too, Petitioner has public interest standing to ensure the City faithful execute a public duty,

23

24 * Under the Code, modifications are limited to only a 20 percent decrease in minimum required setbacks, ten percent increase in permitted building/wall/fence heights, or five percent increase of

25 maximum lot coverage. Modifications in excess of those cited shall require a variance.

26 4 In addition to not being cited under the modification Code section, the Project's 20-100-foot buffer from residential uses (i.e., 60-93 percent deviation from Code requirements) exceeded the

27 Code's analogous 20 percent max deviation from setback requirements, and the Project's 20,395- SF lot (i.e., 18.42 percent deviation from Code requirements) exceeded the Code's analogous five

28 percent max deviation from lot coverage requirements.

l including the duty to narrowly construe categorical exemptions to ensure projects do not evade

2 meaningful mitigation measures to protect the environmental and nearby residents. At a

3 minimum, an MND was required.
t4 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION (CPRA and Cal. Constitution Violations)

47.
a Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-46, as if fully set forth herein.

48.
7 Under the CPRA, upon request, any public agency must make publicly available

8 for inspection and copying any record that it prepared, owns, uses, or retains that is not subject to
the CPRA's statutory exemptions to disclosure. See Gov. Code § 6253.
9
49. In furtherance of the public's right to access public information, the CPRA
10
imposes critical duties on local governments and agencies. First, agencies are obligated to make 11
reasonable efforts to search for and locate requested records, such as assisting the requester in 12

13 identifying the records in question, and asking probing questions of agency staff and consultants.

14 See e.g., Gov. Code §§ 6253(c), 6253.1(a); Community Youth Athletic Center v. City of National
City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1418-1419 ("Community Youth"); Cal. First Amendment
15

16 Coalition v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 159, 166 ("Cal. First').

50. Second, agencies must "promptly" make available the public records to the
17
requester. Gov. Code § 6253(b), emph. added; see also 89 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 39, 3 (2006); 88 18
Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 153, 1-2, 12-13 (2005); Community Youth, 220 Cal.App.4th at 1405.
19
Moreover, the CPRA states that nothing therein "shall be construed to permit an agency to delay
20
or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records." Gov. Code § 6253(d), emph. added. 21
51. Third, before withholding any record responsive to a valid CPRA request, the 22

23 agency must "demonstrate[e] that the record in question is exempt under express provisions of
[the CPRA] or that on the facts of the particular case the public interest served by not disclosing
24

25 the record clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record." Gov. Code §

26 6255, emph. added. To this end, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating with specific facts
why non-disclosure clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record,
27

1 which is not satisfied by the mere invocation of the general policy behind any claimed exemption.

2 See e.g., Cal. First, 67 Cal.App.4th at 167; Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi (2012)

3 205 Cal.App.4th 296, 307.

52. When an agency fails is to satisfy its CPRA obligations, any person may institute

5 proceedings by verified petition for a writ of mandate to enforce her right to inspect or receive a

6 copy of any public record or class of public records. See Gov. Code §§ 6258, 6259. The court

7 shall decide the case after examining the record in camera, if permitted by Evid. Code § 915(b),

8 of the papers filed by the parties and any oral argument and additional evidence as the court may

9 allow. See Gov. Code § 6259(a). If the court finds that the failure to disclose is not justified, it

10 shall order the public official to make the record public. Id., subd. (b). So too, the court must

11 award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing petitioner, a to be paid by the agency

12 from which the petitioner requested the records. Id., subd. (d).

13 53. Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that the City failed to meet its CPRA

14 duties and frustrated Petitioner's and the public's State constitutional right to access public

15 information about this Project. First, the City repeatedly failed to make a reasonable search for

16 requested records by utilizing unduly narrow search parameters, failing to assist Petitioner in

17 aiding the City's efforts to identify requested records, and failing to adequately consult with City

18 staff and employees regarding the scope of the requested records. Second, the City repeatedly

19 failed to promptly provide Petitioner with requested records, such as the fact that zero Project-

20 related emails from 2019 have been disclosed despite more than eight months of requests. Third,

21 the City has repeatedly failed to provide the specific facts demonstrating that the claimed

22 exemptions apply to any of the withheld records, much less showing that non-disclosure clearly

23 outweighs the public interest served by disclosure of the record. This plainly prejudiced

24 Petitioner at the December 17, 2019 hearing where the Adopted Findings were approved, and

25 continued to prejudice Petitioner.

1 54. Petitioner and the public had a right to know the basis for the City's action so they

2 would have an adequate opportunity to present its case on December 17, 2019 why the City
should deny the Project Approvals. Despite Petitioner's best efforts for more than six months

4 (including four CPRA requests, numerous calls/emails to the City, and even initiating a lawsuit),

5 the City obfuscated and delayed the release of vital public records concerning the Project. The

6 City waited until mere days before the December 17, 2019 Project hearing before it would even

7 partially release the requested records, such as the TIA, putting Petitioner and the public behind

8 the proverbial eight-ball to present its case to Council. Many more records remain undisclosed

9 still as of today's date. This frustrated Petitioner's right to a fair opportunity to present its case to

10 the Council why the Project Approvals should have denied.

11 55. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

12 sought in this FAP. Petitioner has already suffered irreparable harm.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief:

15 1. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside
16 and void the Project Approvals for the Project (including CUP No. 528, Variance No. 18-01,

RE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE LAND USE/CEQA PETITION IN THE MATTER OF THE APPROVAL OF THE 7-
ELEVEN PROJECT (2425 S. ATLANTIC BLVD.; COMMERCE, CA 90040)

Dear Ms. Shumway and Mr. Tapia:
This is to inform you that Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice (*Eastyard" or "Petitioner") will be filing suit against the City of Commerce and its sub-agents (collectively "City" or "Respondents") challenging its approval of the 7-Eleven convenience store
and gas station development ("Project"), which includes the approval of a) a conditional use permit (i.e., CUP No. 528), b) two variances (i.e., Variance No. 18-01), and c) the apparent adoption of a categorical exemption (collectively "Project Approvals").
As agents of the Respondents, please take notice, under Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, that Petitioner alleges that the Project Approvals violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), as well as various local and state zoning laws applicable to the Project. Specifically, on May 7, 2019, the City granted the Project Approvals despite substantial evidence from Petitioner, City staff, and City Planning Commissioner that (a) the City could not make the necessary land use
findings required under the Commerce Municipal Code ("CMC" or "Code"); and (b) the Project's potential significant environmental impacts including but not limited to land use, traffic, and public safety hazard impacts. This was all done absent any documentation, citation to a specific
exemption, or other information/evidence in the record relevant to the Code-required findings or
environmental impacts of the Project. As such, Respondents abused its discretion when granting the Project Approvals absent substantial evidence tethered to evidence and analysis in the record- as required under the CMC and CEQA.
Furthermore, the City's granting of the Project Approvals is evidence of a pattern-and- practice of Respondents' failure to conduct adequate CEQA review of development projects as
further evidenced by the most recent approval of the Citadel Mall Expansion Project that included
the approval of, inter alia, Development Agreements 18-032 and 18-033 in reliance on a facially inadequate Final Environmental Impact Report (SCH # 2016091024).

Petitioner intends to pray for the following relief:

Ms. Ms. Shumway and Mr. Tapia
July 25, 2019
Page 2 of 2

1. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City, including all agents thereof, to set aside and void the Project Approvals for the Project (including CUP No. 528 and Variance No. 18-01) pending Respondents' full compliance with the CMC and governing law - including but not limited to making the necessary zoning findings, supporting all conclusions and determinations with substantial evidence, and providing the public with all
relevant documents prior to any future approval of the Project;

2. That the Court issue a temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or injunction ordering the Respondents to refrain from allowing the Project to proceed and issuing further permits while this Petition is pending;

3. That the Court issue : permanent injunction ordering the Project halted pending the Respondents' full compliance with the CMC, CEQA, and other governing law; and

4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.

You will be served with the Petition shortly.
