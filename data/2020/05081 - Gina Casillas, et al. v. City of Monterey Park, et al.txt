PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Respondents and Defendants the City of Monterey Park, the City Council of the

3 City of Monterey Park, and the Planning Commission of the City of Monterey Park (herein

4 collectively referred to as the "City" or "Respondents") have approved the Raising Cane's drive-
5 through development Project for the Real Parties in Interest and Defendants Raising Cane's
6 Restaurants, L.L.C., Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers LLC, Raising Cane's Franchising, L.L.C.,

7 PM Design Group Inc., Kristen Roberts, Chapman W. Lew, and Shiu Ling Lew, (these Real
8 Parties in Interest and Defendants are herein collectively "Developers,' "Applicants," or "Real
9 Parties'). Petitioners and Plaintiffs Gina Casillas and Rafael Casillas (herein collectively referred
10 to as "Petitioners") have continuously objected to the Raising Cane's drive-through project, as it
11 fails to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), due process under the U.S.
12 and California Constitutions, the Government Code, and the Monterey Park Municipal Code
13|| ("Municipal Code"), among other things. The Raising Cane's project has significant adverse
14 impacts to traffic and traffic hazards, planning and land use, hazard and hazardous waste and
15 substances, noise, air quality, cumulative impacts, and water quality, among other things, as is
16 demonstrated by substantial evidence.

17 2. The Project consists of a Raising Cane's drive-through on three parcels, including a
18 structure of approximately 17,863 square feet with two drive-through lanes, and two large menu
19 boards, on an extremely busy street, Atlantic Boulevard, and is separated by a narrow alleyway
20 from certain neighboring residents (the "Project"). Low-density residential property is to the north,
21 northeast, and east of the Project site, which the City has neglected to consider in its Project
22 approval and the Developers have mostly omitted from their reports. The Project will be on the
23 real property commonly known as 1970 S. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park, California, 91754
24 ("Project Site"). The Project Site was used for various gas stations for approximately 70 years,
25 from approximately 1953 to 2004.

26 3. The City initially sent out a notice stating that the Developers submitted a variance
27 application and a conditional use permit (CUP) application and afterwards submitted only a CUP
28 application for the Project and the City erroneously decided that the Project is categorically exempt

2

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

from CEQA based on CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332, Class 32 exemption for in-fill
2 development. The City eliminated the variance request, even though the Project remained the
same. The City has failed to conduct proper environmental review and Petitioners are aggrieved
4 residents and persons who live toward the eastern boundary of the Project site, as their property
abuts the alleyway that the drive-through Project intends to use as one of its driveways to enter and
exit the Project Site. Petitioners have resided on their property for over 29 years and care about the
environment and the community in which they reside.

8 4. The City Planning Commission denied Project approval on March 10, 2020.
9 Raising Cane's appealed the Planning Commission's denial to the City Council. Erroneously, the
10 City Planning Commission held a second hearing on May 12, 2020 and voted to approve the
11 Project, instead of allowing the Raising Cane's appeal to proceed to the City Council. Petitioners
12 appealed the Planning Commission's entire May 12 decision to the City Council. On September 2,
13 2020, the City Council held a hearing, decreased the Project's daily closing time from 1:00 a.m. to
14 10:00 p.m., and approved the Project. The City is biased in favor of the Developers, demonstrated,
15 for instance, in allowing the Developers to proceed with two hearings before the Planning
16 Commission until the Developers could obtain Project approval, failing to provide the public with
17 access to the Project file, failing to adequately notify the public, including residents surrounding
18 the Project Site, of the change from a variance and CUP to only a CUP, and failing to give proper
19 notice of its intent to adopt purported emergency ordinances to expedite Project approval, among
20 other things.

21 5. As required by CEQA, the City should have required the Developers to prepare an
22 environmental assessment, an Initial Study, and environmental impact report (EIR). Wrongfully,
23 the City merely issued a categorical exemption for the Project, knowing the Project has significant
24 adverse impacts to traffic and traffic hazards, planning and land use, hazard and hazardous waste

25 and substances, noise, air quality, cumulative impacts, and water quality, among other things.
26 6. The City's Project approval must proceed with the proper notice and procedure
27 regarding the Project and conduct CEQA environmental review, including review through an EIR,
28 and comply with the Municipal Code, the Government Code, the U.S. and California Constitutions,

3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

and all applicable law. The City Project approval, including the Resolutions approving the Project
2|| and attached conditions of approval, has inadequate findings, lacks substantial evidence, is
3 erroneous, arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and is a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

4 7. Petitioners respectfully request that the City's Project approval be set aside and that
5 the City conduct proper procedure to review the Project through an Initial Study and EIR and
6 comply with all applicable law.

7 PARTIES

8 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Gina Casillas is the owner of the real property commonly
9 known as 1937 S. Bradshawe Avenue, Monterey Park, California, 91754. Said property is located

11 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Rafael Casillas is the owner of the real property commonly
12 known as 1937 S. Bradshawe Avenue, Monterey Park, California, 91754. Said property is located
13 to the east of the Project Site.

17. Real Party in Interest and Defendant Kristen Roberts is an individual believed to be

2 a Project Site applicant.

3 18. Real Party in Interest and Defendant Chapman W. Lew is an individual and Project

4 Site owner.

5 19. Real Party in Interest and Defendant Shiu Ling Lew is an individual and Project Site

6 owner.

7 20. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real

8 Parties in Interest and Defendants Does 1-100, and sue such Real Parties in Interest and Defendants
9 by fictitious names. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and, based on such
10 information and belief, allege that the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest and Defendants
11 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition.
12 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13 21. The Project Site was constructed with the first gasoline station around 1953 and is
14 part of Tract Number 15897, Lots 190, 191, and 192, in Monterey Park, California. Petitioners'
15| real property is Lot 108 of the same Tract.
16 22. The Project Site is zoned S-C, but most of the areas surrounding the Project Site are
17 || low-density residential and zones R-1, including the residences to the north, northeast, and east of
18 the Project Site. The City and Developers have failed to mention or consider these residential
19 areas when describing and approving the Project. In addition, residential properties lie to the
20 northwest of the Project Site, by the intersection of Atlantic Blvd. and Brightwood Street. The
21 Project Site is located in an unusual island that is bounded by an alley to the east and southeast and
22 has several intersections in close proximity. For example, Brightwood Street, to the north of the
23 Project Site, intersects with Atlantic Blvd., the Atlantic Frontage Road, and the north end of the
24 alley, all within less than 100 feet. To the south of the alley, the alley intersects with the north end
25 of the adjacent Atlantic Square Mall and also intersects with Atlantic Blvd., within less than 25
26 feet. A blind curve exists on Atiantic Blvd. to the south of the alley, Also, on the same island, to
27 a the north of the Project Site, there is a Cook's Tortas restaurant and a multi-tenant commercial

28 building.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

23. Petitioners are concerned about the Project's significant adverse impacts, such as
traffic and traffic hazards, planning and land use, hazards and hazardous waste and substances,
noise, air quality, cumulative impacts, and water quality.

24. The City represents that in or about December 2019, the Developers submitted
5 applications for a variance and CUP for the Project. Without providing or disclosing a reason, the
6 City decided to approve the Project through only a CUP application, CUP 19-13. Petitioners
7 repeatedly requested that the City provide the public and them with access to the complete Project

8 file, but the City refused to do so. Consequently, neither the public nor Petitioners have had the
9| ability to review the entire Project file.

10 25. In or about January 2020, the City mailed notice to certain residents stating that the
11 City would hold a hearing to approve the Project's variance application and CUP application. A
12| hearing was set for February 11, 2020 before the Planning Commission.
13 26. On or about January 31, 2020, Gina Casillas contacted the City and specified
14 Project problems and asked questions. For instance, Mrs. Casillas stated that the parking demand
15 was 25 parking spaces, not the proposed 18, It was her understanding that the proposed variance
16 was for the reduced vehicle backup. She also stated that the drive-through took priority over the
17 actual use of the property. In addition, among other things, Mrs. Casillas asked whether the
18 Applicant submitted a civil/grading plan for review; whether the Applicant submitted a turning
19 radius template/plan to ensure that the 90 degree stalls that back onto the alley could maneuver
20 safely; whether the Project complied with the 25-foot setback requirement from the face curb; how
21 the City intended to support the variance a findings for a brand new development project; and what
22 special circumstances existed such that the new project qualified for a variance where a redesign
23 could meet City requirements. Gina Casillas is a City planner for a different City and has been a
24 planner for over 16 years.
25 27. a The City prepared a March 10, 2020 Staff Report. Said Report stated that the
26| Project is categorically exempt from additional environmental review pursuant to CEQA
27 Guidelines Section 15332 as a Class 32 categorical exemption (In-Fill Development Projects). The
28 Staff Report without substantial evidence, further stated that the Project will not result in any

6

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality and that the project can be
2 adequately served by all required utilities and public services. In the executive summary, said
Report states that pursuant to the Municipal Code Section 21.10.040(I) a drive-through is a
conditionally permitted use and that based upon the application, it appears that the proposed uses

5 are consistent with the General Plan. The City lacks substantial evidence to support its
6 conclusions. Further, the Project fails to comply with the Municipal Code development standards
7 and the General Plan. Moreover, Petitioners repeated ly requested that the City make the Project
8 files available for public review, including the Project Plans, Project applications, and everything
9 else in the file, but the City failed to do so. While the Staff Report mentions the R-1 single-family
10 zoned lots to the east, it fails to mention the R-1 and low-density residential areas to the north and
11 northeast of the Project Site. The Staff Report acknowledged that the Project requires a 25-foot
12 setback and that the Developers were requesting a 15-foot setback, whereas a materially reduced,
13 non-compliant setback. The Staff Report is signed by Mark A. McAvoy, Director of Public
14 Works/City Engineer/City Planner. Mr. McAvoy was also the Planning Commission Secretary
15 simultaneously. Mr. McAvoy lacks independence and neutrality to advise the Planning
16 Commission or the City Council. The Staff Report attached a draft resolution, site elevation plans,
17 and a Kimley-Horn Traffic Report dated in 2018. The draft resolutions lack substantial evidence to
18 support their findings and conclusions. The site, floor elevation plans were reduced in size,
19| illegible in certain portions, and are not to scale, so the public and Petitioners required access to

20 actual Project plans and file. The Kimley-Horn Traffic Report iS over one year old and is not
21 signed nor stamped by a licensed engineer, among other deficiencies. Accordingly, the Kimley-
22 Horn Traffic Report lacked the required signature and stamp from an engineer pursuant to Business
23 and Professions Code Section 6735(a), (b). The Staff Report and the Kimley-Horn Traffic Report
24 fail to mention or consider the low-density residential area to the north, northeast, and east of the
25 Project Site, the multiple street intersections and segments that surround the island on which the
26 Project Site is located, and the blind curve on Atlantic Blvd., immediately south of the Project Site,
27 and the residences to the northwest of the Project Site.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

28. On or about March 10, 2020, the City held hearing before the Planning
Commission. Three commissioners were present at the hearing and two were absent. Petitioners

3 and Developers attended said hearing. Neighboring residents did not understand the hearing
process or what was occurring regarding the Project. Petitioners submitted oral and written

5 opposition comments to the City. For example, Mrs. Casillas stated that she is City Planner and
6 processes land use entitlements and evaluates projects for compliance with CEQA for a different
city; that the Project fails to qualify for a categorical exemption under CEQA, including a Class 32
8 exemption; and the Project fails to meet the setback requirements under the Municipal Code,
9 including the front yard setbacks, among other things. Mr. Casillas stated he is a licensed Civil
10 Engineer, traffic impacts were significant, acceptable noise decibel levels were being exceeded,
11 and the Project lacked compliance with the development standards in the Municipal Code, among
12| other things.
13 29. In its usual process, the Planning Commission voted on whether to approve the
14 Project. During the Planning Commission deliberation the following points were made, among
15 others:

16 On March 10, 2020, Commissioner Brossy de Dios expressed concerns about the
17 Project including mitigation for mechanical equipment and noise that was not
18 addressed, queuing for the drive-throughs, level of service E at the alley and Atlantic
19 Blvd. intersection and potential gridlock
20 The Planning Commission also stated that noise and hours of operation are not
21 consistent with the surrounding neighborhood
22 Commissioner Brossy de Dios stated that he is not accustomed to granting CUPs that
23 are in conflict with the Municipal Code
24 The Project is not: compatible land use
25 Commissioner Salazar requested that the Developers consider the neighbors, meaning
26 that the Project had negative impact
27 Two commissioners voted to approve the Project and one voted against the Project. The Project
28 did not receive the requisite votes to approve the Project, so Project approval was denied.

8

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

30. On March 12, 2020, two days after the Planning Commission hearing, Raising
Cane's submitted an appeal to the City Council. The title of the appeal form is, "APPEAL, CITY
OF MONTEREY PARK," the "Appellant's name" on the form is Kristen Roberts, the form states
the "appellant" requests review of the Planning Commission decision, the form states the
relationship of "appellant' to the project or decision is "Applicant," the form has "Appellant's"
a 6 signature, and the form has a box titled, "Statement of Circumstances." [Emphasis added.] That

7 box states, "On a separate page, describe in detail the circumstances of the decision and your

8 reason for the appeal." Attached to this form is a page titled, "Statement of Circumstances."
9 Toward the bottom, the form states, "Appeal applications must be filed with the City Clerk within
10 the prescribed appeal period. An appeal fee is required at the time of application." [Emphasis
11 added.] The one-page appeal form has the words "appeal" or "appellant" eight times.
12 31. Raising Cane's Statement of Circumstances, as part of its appeal to the City
13 Council, states:

14 "On 03/10/2020 the subject project was brought before the Planning Commission (PC) for

15 consideration of staff's recommendation of approval. Due to scheduling conflicts (other obligations) and illness two (2) of the five (5) commissioners were not able to attend said
16 PC. After deliberation of the commissioner's [sic] present, the subject was denied on a 2-1 (yay-nay) vote. The appeal of ruling is based on the fact that the decision made does not
17 take into consideration the vote/input of the commissioners not present and that the approval/denial for the project is based on a body majority and not a present majority. The 18 applicant believes that the project has substantial support from City staff members and

19 PC to be approved at a hearing where all members are present." (Emphasis added.)

20 Interestingly, the Developers knew why two of the Commissioners were absent, knew that the

21 Project had substantial support from the Planning Commission and City staff members, including

22 Mark McAvoy, who simultaneously is the City Planner, Commission Secretary, City Engineer, and
23 Director of Public Works, and cannot objectively advise the Planning Commission and City
24 Council. Moreover, the Developers admitted that the Planning Commission denied Project

25 approval.

26 32. On May 12, 2020, instead of proceeding with Raising Cane's City Council appeal,

27 the City proceeded with an illegal and improper second hearing before the Planning Commission.

28 This was an online Zoom meeting where attendees could only call in. Even though two

9

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

commissioners were newly appointed by the two newly elected City Council members, it was still

a second hearing before the same Planning Commission. Petitioners and neighboring residents
3 attended the hearing and presented verbal and written comments and objections and personal
observations based on fact. The neighboring residents that attended and submitted oral and written
comments were Rodger Tanaka, Julissa Noe, Heidi Dumke, Scott Dumke, and Petitioners.
Alejandro Acevedo presented verbal comments. Written comments were also submitted by
Melinda Santoyo, Oscar Santoyo, Eileen Romero, Christopher Romero, Johnathan Widjaja, Carlos
8 Lozano, Teresa Lozano, Diane Wright, Angel Kuo, Kurt Chen, Michelle Kang, Irma Garcia,
9 Madeleine Garcia, Manuel Duran, Amy Choi, Minoku Sake, and Kiyo Sake. Among the many
10 opposition comments submitted are the following:
11 The Project is very close to existing homes
12 Increased traffic is in a highly residential area
13 Noise levels are overwhelming
14 Related disturbances

15 The alleyway was not designed for heavy traffic
16 Homeowners' backyards directly face the Project direction
17 Existing restaurants currently have their lights facing the residences
18 Constant litter and trash is within the alley
19 Existing loitering and noise in the alley
20 Project is too close to homes
21 Ms. Noe lives 900 feet away from the Project Site
22 Atlantic Blvd. has existing heavy traffic
23 Adding over daily 800 daily trips adds traffic, noise, pollution, car horns, engine noises,
24 and wrap-around lines
25 Project impedes residents' ingress and egress to property
26 Air quality will impact children with asthma
27 Intersection of Atlantic Blvd. and Brightwood Street is already a challenge
28 Many people park on streets and leave trash on sidewalks

5 35. On May 12, 2020, as Raising Cane's stated and knew in its March Appeal

6 Statement of Circumstances, the Planning Commission voted to approve the Project, including the
7 CEQA categorical exemption and the CUP, by a 4 to 1 vote.

8 36. On May 22, 2020, Petitioners filed an appeal to the City Council. The Statement of
9 Circumstances attached to the appeal described the City's Project approval having inadequate
10 findings, lacking substantial evidence, being erroneous, arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and a

11 prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Statement of Circumstances proceeds to state the reasons the
12 CEQA class 32 categorical exemption is inappropriate and inapplicable and why Project approval
13 should be denied and set aside. The Statement of Circumstances also proceeds to state the
14 inadequacies and deficiencies of the purported findings in the Resolution. The attachments to the
15 Statement of Circumstances include the following:

hearing Petitioners and surrounding residents submitted written comments to the City in opposition

2 to the Project. These comments are substantial evidence and personal observations based on fact.
3| The surrounding neighbors include Minoku Sakae, Kiyo Sakae, Julissa Noe, Amy Choi, Rodger

4 Tanaka, and Eileen Romero. Petitioners and residents submitted various photos depicting, among

5 other things, potential fire hazard inside the commercial business to the north, semi-trucks running

6 compressors, fire next to hillside community, view from Project Site and proximity to low-density
residential homes, alley narrowness, hillside, Atlantic Blvd. and Atlantic Shopping Center
8 intersection with the alley, residential garage on Brightwood Street off of the alley, Atlantic
9 Frontage Road, four vehicles stacked on Brightwood Street, alley and circulation, among many
10 others. Petitioners' written comments included the following:

11 Fire danger

12 Existing noise in backyard

13 Increase in traffic accidents

14 Increased traffic in alley

15 Alley not designed for high traffic, impact on hillside

16 Dry branches on island pet store adjacent to Project Site

12 Commissioner Salazar requested that the Developers consider the neighbors, meaning

13 that the Project had negative impact

14 38. At the May 12, 2020 Planning Commission hearing, Planning Commissioners also
15 expressed concerns. For example, Commissioner Tam was concerned with noise and moved to
16 add a condition that a noise study be conducted prior to the City issuing a certificate of occupancy.

17 In addition, Commissioner de Brossy asked why the Project was before the Planning Commission

18 again and stated that he had already voiced his comments at the previous hearing. Moreover, the
19 Commissioners changed the Project's closing time hours from 3:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Fridays
20 and Saturdays, so the Project will close at 1:00 a.m. every day.

21 39. On July1, 2020 Attorney Mejia also submitted written opposition comments to the
22| City including the following:

23 A. The Public, Gina Casillas, and Rafael Casillas have been denied Access to the Project

24 File, Required Before Project Approval

25 B. The Planning Commission Illegally Held a Second Hearing to Approve the Project

26 C. The Agenda and Staff Report for the City Council Hearing Were Not Posted on the

20 At the July 1, 2020 online hearing the City Council stated that it would continue the

21 July 1, 2020 hearing to September 2, 2020, because it needed additional time to review Petitioners'
July 1, 2020 opposition letters. Petitioners did not have sufficient time to review the July 1, 2020

22

23 Staff Report that consisted of hundreds of pages. On or about June 30, 2020 the City posted
Raising Cane's attorneys' June 25, 2020 letter to the City by attorneys at Cox, Castle. At no time

24 did the City provide Petitioners with notice of the June 25, 2020 letter. Petitioners did not have

25 sufficient time to review the Cox, Castle letter by July 1, 2020. The City failed to provide

26 Petitioners with notice that the City had received a June 25, 2020 letter from the Developers'

27 attorneys at Cox, Castle. Although the Cox, Castle letter is dated June 25, 2020, the City did not

28 post it along with its Staff Report for the July 1, 2020 hearing. Instead, the letter was posted as an

16

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

• "addendum" to the July 1, 2020 Staff Report. The City has not posted Petitioners' July 1, 2020

2 letters.

3 41. In its June 25 letter, Cox, Castle requested to continue the July 1, 2020 hearing to
4 allow the City Council to consider the pending zoning regulations, including reducing setback
5 requirements for drive-through aisles on commercially zoned properties. On June 25 the City had
6 not publicly disclosed that it intended to reduce setbacks for drive-through aisles, yet Cox, Castle

7 knew.

8 42. At the July 1, 2020 hearing, the City Council did not acknowledge that it was it
9 continuing the July 1, 2020 hearing per the request of Cox, Castle. Instead, the City Council
10 misleadingly stated that it was continuing the hearing to read Petitioners July 1, 2020 written
11 comments. In addition, the City Council erroneously stated at the hearing that its comments about
12 continuing the hearing were not part of the administrative record.
13 43. After July1, 2020, Petitioners learned that the City intended to adopt a Land Use
14 Phase II of the Monterey Park Business Recovery Plan (Land Use Phase II) through purported
15 | "emergency" ordinances. Through the Land Use Phase II, the City sought to expedite Project
16 approval as a drive-through that was non-compliant with the City's Municipal Code and the
17 General Plan.

18 44. The City has been deceptive in adopting these purported "emergency" ordinances to
19 approve the Raising Cane's drive-through Project on an expedited basis. Below are certain

20 Sections of ordinances 2184 and 2185 that expedite Project approval despite the Project's failure to
21 comply with the Municipal Code and the General Plan. Raising Cane's has had much influence on
22 the Planning Commission and City Council, to the extent the City has adopted ord inances that
23 specifically benefit and will approve the Raising Cane's Project on an expedited basis.

20 46. These expedited AUP procedures allow for the City Planner to approve the Raising
21 Cane's Project in a matter of days, without the required public notice, without the hearings before
22 the DRB and the Planning Commission, and without complying with the Municipal Code and
23 General Plan, all under the pretext of Covid19. As is clear, City Planner Mark McAvoy has

20

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2 City, including in its City's Staff Reports, have failed to address, analyze, or disclose Petitioners'

In email correspondence Mr. Pollock, the Developers' Kimley Horn Traffic Engineer
stated to City planner Ms. Tewasart that the alley and Atlantic Blvd. intersection is not

O currently operating at an acceptable level of service in the evening peak hour

9 In email correspondence between Mr. Pollock and City planner McAvoy, to push the

8 project through, the City and Developers adjusted the traffic data numbers to decrease
the apparent traffic impacts, even though the decreased numbers reach untrue

conclusions

12 the alley as opposed to the Atlantic Blvd. driveway entry to the Project Site

13 The Project's cumulative impacts are not analyzed, such as the drive-through project

19 Exhibit 7 is a true and correct copy of attorney Maria Mejia's August 5, 2020 letter

20 to the City Council in opposition to the Land Use Phase II, on behalf of Gina and Rafael Casillas

21 50.
22 On September 2, 2020, the City Council held an online hearing and Petitioners and

23 neighboring residents spoke in opposition to the Project and submitted additional substantial

24 evidence, including and personal observations based on fact and expert opinion. Several letters

25 that were submitted by Petitioners and neighboring residents for the September 2 hearing were not
read into the record on September 2, but they remain part of the administrative record and provide
26 substantial evidence. The Developers also attended in support of Project approval. The
27 Developers' attorney stated that the Project is fully consistent with the City's zoning regulations
28 and added that last month the City passed the Business Recovery Program which authorizes the
23

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

City Engineer, who is Mark McAvoy, to approve the drive-through plan that provides for setbacks
2 that differ from the underlying zone by way of AUP and that the Project is fully consistent with the
City zoning regulations. The Developers' attorney introduced Mr. Sami and Mr. Pollock. Mr.

4 Sami does not have the credentials to sign off on the Terracon Phase I ESA that is over one year
5 old. The Terracon Phase ESA must be redone and is not an authorization for the City to disregard

6 the need for environmental review of the Project Site through an EIR. The Kimley Horn Traffic
Report also lacked the required signature and stamp or seal from an engineer as required pursuant
8 to Business and Professions Code § 6735(a), (b). The Developers' Traffic and Phase I ESA
9 Reports lack the required signatures and qualifications of experts, among other things, SO the City
10 cannot rely on them to approve the Project. Councilmember Fred Sornoso asked Mark McAvoy
11 whether the Project was using the alley. Councilmember Henry Lo asked whether the Project was
12 going to use the alley for queuing. Mr. McAvoy stated that the Project is going to use the alleys.
13 The Developers have no right or authorization to interfere or take Petitioners' and other
14 neighboring residents' rights to the alley.

15 51. The City Council voted to approve the Project, with an additional condition that the
16 Project closing hours be reduced from 1:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The City Council has adopted
17 Resolution No. 12194, which is inaccurate, lacks substantial evidence and adequate findings, and is
18 a prejudicial abuse of discretion. For instance, in Section 3, the Resolution omits many substantive
19| comments submitted by Petitioners, including expert opinions, and Section 4 states there is no
20 substantive evidence in the record supporting Petitioners' appeal. The Resolution omits any
21 reference to the August 28, 2020 and September 2, 2020 letters including expert opinions
22 submitted by Petitioners before the September 2 hearing. The City Council 2 disregarded
23 Petitioners' and other residents' substantial evidence, including personal observations based on fact
24 and expert opinions, with regard to the several significant adverse reports to traffic and traffic
25 hazards, planning and land use, hazard and hazardous waste and substances, noise, air quality,
26 cumulative impacts, and water quality, among other things. The City Council also disregarded the
27 Project's substantial adverse impacts and detriment to the health, safety, and general welfare of the
28 public. Thus, City Council has illegally approved the Project and Report approval should be set

24

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

aside and an Initial Study and EIR should be required.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND

3 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

52. Petitioners have exhausted all available City administrative remedies in objecting to
the approval of the Project, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21177.

53. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section
7 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City, a copy of which is
8 attached hereto as Exhibit A.

54. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a

10 copy of the original petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of the letter of
11 notification is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

12 55. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested
13 writ of mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the proposed Project. In the absence
14 of such a remedy, Respondents' approval violates the State environmental law, the City's
15 Municipal Code, the California and U.S. Constitution, and the Government Code. Moreover,

16 Petitioners and neighbors will suffer irreparable harm through this Project that is in their
17 community and immediately adjacent to them. Petitioners and neighbors have a clear, present, and a
18 substantial right to the performance of Respondents' duty because they reside in proximity to the
19 Project Site and have an interest in preserving the environment, including traffic and traffic
20 hazards, land use and planning, hazards and hazardous waste and substances, noise, air quality,
21 cumulative impacts, and water quality as well as the character of the community in which they
22 reside.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Respondents' and Real Parties in Interest' Failure to Consider and Prepare CEQA Review,
25 including Initial Study and an Environmental Impact Report in Violation of Public Resources Code §21000, et seq., and 14 California Code of Regulations §15000, et seq.)
26
56.
27 Petitioners hereby incorporate paragraphs 1 through 55, inclusive.

28

25

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

57. As set forth above, the City has violated Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. and
14 California Code of Regulations §15000 et seq. by granting the Developers a categorical
3 exemption and failing to prepare an Initial Study and an EIR and in approving the Developers'
4 Project when the record reveals that the Project would have significant, unmitigated adverse effects
5on the environment. The City also failed to provide the public, including Petitioners, with fair and
6  adequate notice and review. The record demonstrates, based on substantial evidence, including
expert opinion and personal observations based on fact, that the City should have required an EIR
8 for the Project, including, but not limited to, the following:
a. The City failed to adequately address the traffic and traffic hazards;
10 b. The Project approval failed to sufficiently discuss any inconsistencies between the
11 proposed Project and the General Plan;

12 C. The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan;

13 d. The City has failed to adequately address the Project's significant adverse impact on
14 factors, such as traffic and traffic hazards, planning and land use, hazards and hazardous
15 waste and substances, noise, air quality, cumulative impacts, and water quality;
16 e. The City failed to provide the public and Petitioners with access to the Project files;
17 f. The City failed to provide the public and Petitioners access to the administrative record.

18 g. The City failed to adequately disclose the Project;

19 h. The City has failed to provide adequate notice and public comment period;
20 i. The City improperly issued a categorical exemption; and

21 j. The City improperly purports to mitigate the Project through the categorical exemption,
22 rather than prepare an initial study and EIR.
23 58. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents and Real Parties have
24 abused their discretion, failed to comply in a manner required by law, and lack substantial
25 evidence, violating their duties under CEQA. Accordingly, the Project CUP and categorical
26 exemption approval must be set aside, and an Initial Study and EIR are required.
27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Respondents' and Real Parties in Interest' Violation of Monterey Park Municipal Code)
3 59. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs
4 through 58, inclusive.
5 60. The evidence presented to the City during the approval process demonstrated that
6 the Project violates the Monterey Park Municipal Code for several reasons, including, but not
7 limited to, failing to comply with development standards, noise standards, appeal requirements,
8 and CUP requirements. For example, the following Municipal Code requirements have been
contravened: MPMC §§ 21.10.040, 21.04.754, 21.22.38, 21.10.100, 9.53.040, 1.10.01, 21.32.060,
10| 21.10.020, 1.10.080, 21.32.140, and 21.32.020.
11 61. The proposed location will harm the public convenience and welfare. The location
12 of the Project use is improper in relation to adjacent uses or the development of the community.
13 The location of the Project use will be materially detrimental to the character of development in the 14 immediate neighborhood. The proposed Project use is inconsistent with the various elements and 15 objectives of the General Plan. The conditions imposed fail to protect the best interests of the
16 surrounding property and neighborhood or to lessen or prevent any detrimental effect.
17 62. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents and Real Parties have
18 violated their duties under the Monterey Park Municipal Code, including abuse of discretion,
19 failure to proceed in a manner required by law, and lack substantial evidence and adequate
20 findings. Therefore, the Project approval, including the CUP and categorical exemption, must be
21 set aside.
22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
23 (Respondents and Real Parties in Interest Violation of Government Code) 24 63. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 25 through 62, inclusive.
26 64. The Government Code requires that Project approval comply with the General Plan, 27 hazards and hazardous waste and substances, and the protection of the health, safety, and general
28

27

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

welfare of the public. As set forth above, the City and Real Parties have failed to comply with the

2 General Plan, disclosing and evaluating the hazards and hazardous waste and substances on the
3 Project Site, and have acted against the public's health and safety and general welfare. The

4 proposed location will harm the public convenience and welfare. The location of the Project use is

5 improper in relation to adjacent uses or the development of the community. The location of the
6 Project use will be materially detrimental to the character of development in the immediate
neighborhood. The proposed Project use is inconsistent with the various elements and objectives
8 of the General Plan. The conditions imposed fail to protect the best interests of the surrounding
9 property and neighborhood or to lessen or prevent any detrimental effect.

10 65. Accordingly, in disregarding the requirements of the General Plan, the hazards and
11 hazardous waste and substances, and the public's health, safety, and general welfare the
12 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest failed to comply with the Government Code.
13 66. The City and Real Parties have failed to proceed in a manner required below, lack
14 adequate findings, and lack substantial evidence.

15 67. The Project does not qualify for a categorical exemption because it is on Cortese
16 lists. The Project also fails to comply with the Cortese list disclosure requirements and other
17 hazardous waste and substance requirements. For example, the Project fails to comply with
18 Government Code Sections 65962.5, 65860, 65357, 65901, 65906, 65906.5, 65911 and 68352.
19 68. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
20 have violated their duties under the Government Code. Therefore, Project approval, including the
21 CUP and categorical exemption, must be set aside.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Respondents and Real Parties in Interest Violation of the California and U.S. Constitutions)
24 69. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs
25 through 68, inclusive.
26 70. Respondents and Real Parties in Interest have violated Petitioners' procedural and
27 substantive due process rights. Petitioners and other residents have significant and substantial
28 property interests that the City and Real Parties have violated. For example, the City failed to
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

provide Petitioners fair hearing with the opportunity to be heard and the City is biased toward the
2 Developers. The bias and unfair hearings are demonstrated in instances such as where the City
failed to provide Petitioners with adequate notice, where the Planning Commission held two
4 hearings until it approved the Project, the City Council adopted "emergency" Land Use Phase II to

5 expedite Project approval, City Planner Mark McAvoy holds several simultaneous City positions
6 and advises the Planning Commission and City Council, even though he has predetermined to give

7 Project approval and the City Council approved the Project and denied Petitioners' appeal.

8 71. Therefore, the Project categorical exemption and CUP approval must be set aside.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Declaratory Relief against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

11 72. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs
12 1 through 71, inclusive.
13 73. An actual controversy now exists between Petitioners, Respondents, and Real
14| Parties in Interest regarding their rights and duties with respect to the CUP and CEQA categorical
15 exemption approval. Petitioners contend that the City has no legal right to issue the CUP and
16 CEQA categorical exemption and that Real Parties in Interest have no legal right to obtain the CUP
17 and CEQA categorical exemption where the Project Site is listed as a hazardous waste and
18 substance site on the Cortese list and has significant adverse impacts to traffic and traffic hazards,
19 planning and land use, hazards and hazardous waste and substances, noise, air quality, cumulative
20 impacts, and water quality. To do so, as described in this petitioned complaint constitutes an
21 illegal violation of CEQA and CUP requirements.

22 74. Petitioners are informed and believe that Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
23 contend their actions are legal and in compliance with CEQA and the CUP requirements.

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:

26 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs seek peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Code of
27 Civil Procedure Public Resources Code Sections 21168.5 and 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure
