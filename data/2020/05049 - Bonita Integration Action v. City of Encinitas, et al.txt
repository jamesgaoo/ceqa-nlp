Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of Encinitas ("City" or "Respondent")

3 ofa tentative map, density bonus, design review permit, and coastal development permit for the Bonita

4 Drive Density Bonus Subdivision Project (18-086), located at 754 Bonita Drive in Encinitas,
California ("Project"), and the related determination of an exemption under the California

6 I Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
2. The City violated its General Plan, Local Coastal Program ("LCP"), and Municipal Code in

8 approving the Project. The Project is substantially inconsistent with several important land use

9 restrictions.

10 3. The City also violated CEQA, Pub. Res. Code ยง 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among

11 other things, the City failed to adequately consider the environmental impacts associated with the

12 Project, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible

13 alternatives and mitigation.

14 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

15 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

16 PARTIES

17 5. Petitioner Bonita Integration Action is a non-profit corporation, whose mission is dedicated to

18 ensuring that development projects in Old Encinitas are developed with appropriate steps to follow correct

12 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

13 11. The Project site is 2.37 acres located within the community of Old Encinitas. It is

14 designated Residential 3 (R-3) in the City's General Plan and is zoned Residential 3 (R-3).

15 12. The existing site includes a detached single-family residence and an accessory building also

16 used as a residence,

17 13. The Project area developed primarily in the 1970's through mid-1990's.

18 14. The site is surrounded by single- and multi-family residential uses to the north, south and

19 west, and is bordered by a school and wetland to the east.

20 15. The Project applicant sought approval of a tentative map, density bonus, design review

21 permit, and coastal development permit from the City in order to develop a ten-unit detached single-

22 family home residential subdivision with nine market rate units and one unit the applicant described as
23 "affordable," each on their own separate lot.

24 16. The Project would include construction of a private road, landscape, street improvements,

25 the installation of a water and sewer main to serve the proposed parcels, undergrounding of utiliites,

26 and grading for building pads.

27

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 3
Writ Petition

17. The Project applicant sought waivers for development lot standard modifications, including
reduction in net lot area, setbacks, lot coverage and lot dimensions, a private road to service more than
ten units, and to provide one single-story home where two are required.
18. The Project applicant also sought a concession/incentive to allow the two-story units to
exceed the height limit for the zone as measured from the lower of natural or finished grade for nine of

the ten lots.

19. The Project was presented to the City Planning Commission at its September 19, 2019

8 meeting. City staff represented the "Residential 3 zone is intended to provide for single-family

9 detached residential units with minimum lot sizes of 14,500 net square feet and maximum densities of

10 three units per acre, as a rural to suburban transition."

11 20. City staff also represented the Project was exempt from environmental review under

12 CEQA, citing CEQA Guidelines Sections 15332 and 15301(I).

13 21. Petitioner and others, including in several letters prior to the Planning Commission meeting

14 and at the meeting, noted several problems with the Project and the City's approach to the Project,

15 including that the Project violates the General Plan, LCP, and Municipal Code. Petitioner and others

16 also noted the Project is not exempt from CEQA.

17 22. Comments noted, among other things:

18 a. The Project could not rely upon the density bonus provisions because it would lead to

19 adverse impacts on public health and safety and because the Project was not replacing

20 all currently affordable units on the site;

21 b. The Project is inconsistent with existing land uses in the neighborhood and community

22 character;

23 C. The Project applicant failed to comply with Citizens Participation Program

24 requirements;

25 d. The Project would lead to a loss of parking spaces;

26 e. The Project failed to comply with California Fire Code requirements, including having

27 access that was not consistent with road width requirements, having a road that was not

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 4
Writ Petition

uniformly wide and accessible, and having a road that is often obstructed such that the
mandated minimum width was not achieved;

f. The Project's drainage was insufficient and would lead to flooding of neighboring
properties and roads;
g. The Project would pose health and safety impacts not adequately analyzed by the
applicant and the City;

h. The Project would pose traffic impacts not adequately analyzed by the applicant and the

8 City;

9 i. The Project would pose erosion, soil, and stability impacts not adequately analyzed by

10 the applicant and the City;

11 j. The Project would pose water quality and habitat impacts not adequately analyzed by
12 the applicant and the City;

13 k. The Project would pose road maintenance impacts not adequately analyzed by the

14 applicant and the City;

15 1. The Project violates the City's Climate Action Program;

16 m. The Project violates the Encinitas Design Guidelines; and

17 n. The Project violates the LCP.

18 23. The Planning Commission voted unanimously to continue the Project and requested the

19 applicant to work with staff to address several concerns.

20 24. The Planning Commission again considered the Project, as well as the applicant's responses

21 to its requests, at its October 17, 2019 meeting.

22 25. Again, Petitioner and others, including in letters prior to the Planning Commission meeting

23 and at the meeting, noted several problems with the Project and the City's approach to the Project, as

24 well as with the inadequacy of the applicant's responses to Planning Commission requests.

25 26. Again, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to continue the Project and requested

26 the applicant to work with staff to address several concerns.

27 27. The Commission also encouraged the Project applicant to work with the community;

28 however, the applicant subsequently failed to even meet with community representatives.

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 5
Writ Petition

1 28. The Planning Commission again considered the Project, as well as the applicant's responses

2 to its requests, at its November 21, 2019 meeting.

3 29. Again, Petitioner and others, including in letters prior to the Planning Commission meeting
and at the meeting, noted several problems with the Project and the City's approach to the Project, as

5 well as with the inadequacy of the applicant's responses to Planning Commission requests.

6 30. Despite these concerns, the Planning Commission voted to approve the Project with
conditions, including approval of Resolution PC 2019-42.
31. Petitioner filed a timely appeal of the Planning Commission's approval.

9 32. The Project was presented to the City Council at its February 12, 2020 meeting.

10 33. Again, Petitioner (including in a February 11, 2020 letter) and others noted several

11 problems with the Project and the City's approach to the Project, including that the Project violates the

12 General Plan, LCP, and Municipal Code.

13 34. Petitioner and others also noted the Project is not exempt from CEQA.

14 35. Petitioner and others also noted the proposed findings for the Project were insufficient and

15 could not be made.

16 36. Despite these concerns, the City Council voted to approve the Project, including approval

17 of Resolution No. 2020-01 affirming the decision of the Planning Commission.

18 37. A Notice of Exemption was filed by the City on February 13, 2020.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

21 38. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

22 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

23 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

24 hearings.

25 39. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

26 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

27 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 6
Writ Petition

40. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
41. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of
the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

6 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.
42. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

8 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the MND. In the absence of
such remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will

10 suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the

11 Project.

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW, GENERAL PLAN, LCP, AND MUNICIPAL CODE)

14 43. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set

15 forth herein in full.

16 44. The Project violates numerous goals and policies of the City's General Plan, including the

17 following:

18 a. HE Policy 3.8 which states: "Adapt residential development to the terrain." The

19 Project's proposed grading, inadequate landscaping plan, and scale of development fail

20 to adapt the proposed residential development to the surrounding terrain;

21 b. HE Policy 3.12, as the Project failed to adequately address the issue of view blockage

22 during design review;

23 C. LUE Policy 2.2 which states: "Discourage development that sacrifices long-term goals

24 in preference to short-term needs." The Project, including its multitude of deviations

25 from development standards, sacrifices the long-term goals of the General Plan and

26 LCP in preference to the short-term need for affordable housing for a minimal one (1)

27 affordable unit;

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 7
Writ Petition

d. LUE Policy 2.7, as the Project fails to implement mechanisms to ensure the
preservation of significant environmental areas by, among other things, failing to
conduct the appropriate environmental review as required by CEQA;

4 e. LUE Policy 2.10 as the Project's inadequate review failed to guarantee that the required
access, utilities, and services, were available prior to development. For example, the

6 Project fails to ensure that the required recreational area in the community is available

7 prior to development pursuant to Recreational Element Policy 1.5;

8 f. LUE Goal 6 which states: "Every effort shall be made to ensure that the existing

9 desirable character of the communities is maintained." The Project's scale, intensity,

10 and failure to conduct the appropriate review pursuant to CEQA is inconsistent with this

11 goal;

12 g. LUE Policy 6.5 as the Project fails to consider the adjacent existing development's

13 constraints and opportunities. The Project's reduced setback and large scale of several

14 of the proposed structures is incompatible with the adjacent existing development;

15 h. PSE Policy 1.14 which states: "Where development creates the need for new public

16 safety services and/or equipment, that development shall be responsible for the cost of

17 such services/equipment." As comments noted, the access road for the Project will

18 require improvements to meet the requirements of California State Fire Code Sections

19 503.1.1 & 503.2.1. The Project must be responsible for the cost of any required

20 improvements to the access road;

21 i. RME Policy 3.6, which provides: "Future development shall maintain significant
22 mature trees to the extent possible and incorporate them into the design of development

23 projects." The Project proposes extensive grading and will remove all vegetation at the

24 Project site, including, among other things, multiple mature trees;

25 i. RME Goal 5, which provides: "The City will make every effort to participate in

26 programs to improve air and water quality in the San Diego region. (Coastal

27 Act/30231)." The attempt to exempt the Project from CEQA review violates this goal,

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 8
Writ Petition

1 and fails to ensure the Project's air and water quality impacts are appropriately analyzed

2 and addressed;

3 k. RME Policy 7.1, which provides: "Require that paleontological, historical and

4 archaeological resources in the planning area are documented, preserved or salvaged if

5 threatened by new development. (Coastal Act/30250)." The Project fails to include any

6 such review, documentation, or preservation efforts;

7 1. RME Policy 7.2, which provides: "Conduct a survey to identify historic structures and

8 archaeological/ cultural sites throughout the community and ensure that every action is

9 taken to ensure their preservation. (Coastal Act/30250/30253(5))." The Project fails to

10 include any such survey;

11 m. RME Goal 9: which provides: "The City will encourage the abundant use of natural

12 and drought tolerant landscaping in new development and preserve natural vegetation,

13 as much as possible, in undeveloped areas. (Coastal Act/30240/30251)." The Project's

14 landscape plan provides nearly no vegetation and relies on future homeowner to install

15 their own landscaping; thus, failing to ensure the abundant use of natural and drought

16 tolerant landscaping. Additionally, the Project fails to analyze its potential impacts to

17 vegetation in the surrounding area, including the adjacent canyon;

18 n. RME Policy 9.2 which provides: "All drainage courses should be maintained in

19 natural or semi-natural vegetation utilizing existing topography as opposed to concrete

20 ditches or pipes. (Coastal Act/30231/30240)." The Project's extensive grading and

21 drainage plan are inconsistent with the policy to maintain natural or semi-natural

22 vegetation;

23 0. RME Policy 11.8 which provides: "Preserve and promote the right to produce unique

24 horticultural crops and community gardens in Encinitas." The Project's failure to

25 conduct CEQA review violates this policy's requirements as they relate to the Ocean

26 Knoll Elementary Farm and associated community garden;

27

28

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas Page 9
Writ Petition

1 p. RME Goal 13 which provides: "Create a desirable, healthful, and comfortable

2 environment for living while preserving Encinitas, unique natural resources land use

3 policies that will preserve the environment. (Coastal Act/ 30250/30251);

4 q. RME Policy 13.5 which provides "The City shall promote and require the conservation

5 and preservation of natural resources and features of the area in their natural state and

6 avoid the creation of a totally urbanized landscape. Encourage the planting of trees and
7 other vegetation, especially native species, to enhance the environment. (Coastal

8 Act/30240/30251)." The Project's impacts related to, among other things, grading,

9 removal of all vegetation on Project site, and construction of the large proposed
10 residences with inadequate setbacks will contribute to urbanizing the landscape in

11 violation of this policy;

12 r. RME Policy 14.1 which provides: "The best strategy to reduce erosion and

13 sedimentation is to reduce to the maximum extent feasible, grading and removal of

14 vegetation. It is the policy of the City that, in any land use and development, grading

15 and vegetation removal shall be limited to the minimum necessary. (Coastal

16 Act/30240/30250)." Among other things, the Project's construction impacts and

17 removal of vegetation violate the City's policies concerning erosion and sedimentation;

18 and

19 S. RM Policy 14.4 which provides: "Revegetation and appropriate landscaping of all

20 areas graded and scraped of vegetative cover shall be required with land use and
21 development. Plantings, hydroseeding, and irrigation systems used shall be selected on
22 the bases of minimizing erosion and conserving water. (Coastal Act/30251)." The

23 Project's landscaping plan fails to ensure that the Project site is adequately revegetated

24 following the Project's grading and clearing of existing vegetation.

25 45. The Project violates numerous provisions of the LCP, including the policies identified
26 above.

27 46. The Project violates the State density bonus law, and related Municipal Code provisions,

28 including the requirement in Government Code Section 65915 to have "at least the same number of

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas V. Page 10
Writ Petition

1 units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and

2 occupied by, persons or families in the same or lower income category as those households in
occupancy."
47. The Project violates the City's Design Guidelines and Municipal Code, including Design
Guidelines Section 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 3.2.12, 4.1.5, and 7.3.8, and Municipal Code Chapter 23.08, which

6 requires a project to be consistent with the City's Design Guidelines.
48. The Project violates numerous provisions of the Municipal Code, including the following:
a. Encinitas Municipal Code Section 10.04.010;
b. Encinitas Municipal Code Chapter 23.24;

10 C. Encinitas Municipal Code Section 30.16.010;

11 d. Encinitas Municipal Code Section 30.80.090;

12 e, Encinitas Municipal Code Sections 23.08.070 & 23.08.080.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CEQA PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS)

15 49. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

16 forth herein in full.

17 50. The City improperly considered the Project exempt from CEQA, inconsistent with, among

18 other things, Public Resources Code Sections 21159.21 and 21159.23 and CEQA Guidelines Sections

19 15192, 15301, and 15332.

20 51. Among the reasons the Project is not exempt are the following: (a) the Project is

21 inconsistent with the City's General Plan, LCP, and Municipal Code; (b) the Project would result in

22 significant effects, including to traffic, parking, community character, fire and emergency services,

23 noise, air quality, drainage, and water quality; (c) the Project cannot be adequately served by all

24 required utilities and public services; and (d) there is a reasonable possibility that the Project would

25 have a significant effect on the environment or the residents of the Project due to unusual
26 circumstances and cumulative impacts.

27 52. Even if the Project were properly subject to an exemption, exceptions to that exemption

28 apply pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, including significant effects due to unusual

Bonita Integration Action v. City of Encinitas
Writ Petition Page 11

circumstances and significant cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same types in the same
place.
53. The City failed to prepare an Initial Study to determine what environmental analysis was
necessary, as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15063.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (FAILURE TO CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT AND RELATED ACTIVITIES)
54. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

8 forth herein in full.
55. The City failed to consider all aspects of the Project and related activities.

10 56. The City failed to consider future development that foreseeably will occur as a result of Project

11 approval.

12 57. The City improperly segmented the Project, piecemealing or otherwise avoiding reasonably

13 foreseeable impacts, and separately focusing on isolated parts of the whole.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (FAILURE TO PREPARE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS REQUIRED BY CEQA)

16 58. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if set

17 forth herein in full.

18 59. The City failed to prepare environmental analysis consistent with CEQA, including Public

19 Resources Code Section 21084 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15063.

20 60. Even if the Project were properly subject to an exemption, exceptions to that exemption

21 apply pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, including significant effects due to unusual

22 circumstances and significant cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same types in the same

23 place.

24 61. The City failed to consider feasible alternatives, including but not limited to, alternatives

25 requiring less impacts that meet some or all of the Project objectives.

26 62. The City failed to consider feasible mitigation measures, failed to mitigate for each

27 environmental effect, illegally deferred mitigation, and failed to provide for effective and enforceable

28 mitigation.
