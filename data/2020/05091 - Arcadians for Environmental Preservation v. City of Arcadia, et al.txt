27 INTRODUCTION
Petitioner ARCADIANS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION ("AEP or "Petitioner")
28 | alleges as follows:

-(-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1. Petitioner challenges certain discretionary land use decisions made by respondent

2 City Council of the City of Arcadia ("Council") as the elected legislative body for respondent

3 City of Arcadia ("City"). (The Council and the City are hereinafter collectively referred to as
4 "Respondent.") Specifically, Petitioner challenges Respondent Council's denial of the appeal

5 of the City Planning Commission's approval of Homeowner's Association Appeal No. HOA 20-

6 01 and Minor Administrative Modification No. Minor AM 20-09, and the Council's affirmation

7 of the Planning Commission's rejection of the findings of the Arcadia Highland Homeowner's
8 Association Architectural Review Board and approval of the application submitted by "WYF
9 Architecture" on behalf of Julie Wu, to completely remodel and redesign the existing single-
10 story single-family residence at 2011 Highland Oaks Drive, converting it into a two-story
11 structure, including (without limitation) the "Class 1" categorical exemption approved in
12 connection therewith (collectively, the "Project").
NNVI 2 NOANTIOOT CIOEIIT A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 2. Petitioner contends the City's use of a "Class 1" categorical exemption to approve
14 the "Project" and approval by the Council (including an unelected subordinate body thereto),
15 violate specific provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code
16 §§ 21000, et seq.: "CEQA") and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA (Title 14, Cal.
17 Code of Regs., §§ 15000, et seq.: the "Guidelines"), a statutory and regulatory framework often
18 referred to as the "Holy Grail" of California's environmental laws.
19 3. Petitioner is challenging the Project because (among other things) it will result in
20 significant impacts on the environment that the City failed to adequately assess or mitigate in
21 accordance with CEQA and the Guidelines. Respondent ignored fair arguments supported by
22 substantial evidence showing significant unmitigated environmental impacts would result from
23 the Project's cumulative impacts on the environment and unusual circumstances.
24 4. In approving the Project, Respondent disregarded or treated as a mere a formality
25 the specific and substantive requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines.
26 5. Petitioner also contends that Respondent's approval of the Project violates specific
27 requirements of the California Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq.: the

28 "PZL"). Petitioner alleges the Respondent ignored its duty to consider the City's General Plan

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 policies as well as the Council's Resolution No. 7272, setting forth the City's Single Family
2 Residential Design Guidelines, thereby rendering Respondent's decision unlawful.

3 6.

4

5 Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside Respondent's approval of

6 the Project by issuing a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or
1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. These claims

7 are based on the following allegations:

8 7. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9

10 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094.5, and
187 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and/or 21168.5 of the Public Resources

Code.

11 8.

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 12 because Respondents, the Project, and the property are located in Los Angeles County.
13 Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles County Superior Court

14 9. PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST
Petitioner is a grassroots unincorporated association composed of and supported
15 by community members and others devoted to the preservation of the environment. Petitioner
16 brings this action for the purpose of (among other things) assuring Respondent's compliance
17 with the State's environmental laws. Petitioner's members reside within the

18 rent real property within the City. On behalf of these and other City residents, Petitioner
19 challenges Respondent's approval of the Project. City and own or

20 10.

21 Petitioner has associational standing to bring this action and is a party beneficially
interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief (i) because in
22 accordance subdivision (c) of Public Resources Code section 21 177, Petitioner is an organization
23

24

25 formed after the approval of the Project to maintain an action against Respondent under CEQA,
and (ii) because at least one member of Petitioner complied with subdivisions (a) and (b) of

26 commenting on and objecting to the Project both orally and in writing. Unless this Court grants
27 Public Resources Code section 21177 and exhausted administrative remedies by timely

the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from Respondent's decision to approve the
28 Project will extend to areas in which Petitioner's members live and will directly and adversely

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

affect their health and living environment. Consequently, Petitioner is directly and beneficially
2 interested in the issuance of the requested writ of mandate,

3 11.

4

5 Petitioner believes Respondent City is a general law city organized and existing
under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California, and is situated in the County of

6 the City, including (but not limited to) implementing and complying with the provisions of

7 Los Angeles. The City is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in all areas within

8

9 CEQA, the Guidelines, the PZL, the Government Code and the City's own adopted regulations
and guidelines.
12.

10

11 Respondent Council is the duly constituted legislative body of the City. The
Council is responsible for the formulation and implementation of land use plans in the City (and,

LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 13 in some cases, areas within the City's sphere of influence), including the preparation and
12 certification of EIRs.

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
14 interest Julie Wu [Hsieh] is an individual and the owner of the property at 2011 Highland Oaks
15 Drive where the Project is located.

16 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that real party in
17 interest Wallace Y. Fu, Architect, a Professional Corporation, doing business as "WYF
18 Architecture," and was identified in Project documents as the Project applicant.
19 15.

20 Corporation ("WYF"), as the real parties in interest in this action, Petitioner has fully complied
21 By naming Julie Wu ("Wu") and Wallace Y. Fu, Architect, a Professional

22 with subdivision (a) of Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.
16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the respondents named
23 herein as DOES 1 through 10, and the real parties in interest named herein as DOES 11 through
24 25, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents and real parties in interest by such fictitious
25 names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of those Doe
26

27 parties when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that each
of the parties designated herein as a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events and
28 actions referred to herein.

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all relevant
2 times the City, the Council, Wu and WYF (collectively, "RPIs"), and the Doe respondents and
real parties in interest were and are the agents of each other, authorized to do the acts herein
alleged, each of which was ratified by the others.

18. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of Does
through 25 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues Does 1 through 25 by such fictitious
names. Petitioner will amend this petition to allege the true names and capacities of the Doe
respondents when the same becomes known to it. Reference to "City", "Council," or
"Respondent" herein shall mean the named respondents and Does 1 through 10, and references

10 to "RPIs"' herein shall mean the above-named real parties in interest and Does 11 through 25.

11 19. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent, real
12 parties in interest, and each of the Does proximately caused the acts, omissions to act, and/or
NNVI 2 NOCNIIOOIN CIOEIHT A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 injuries herein alleged.
14 20. Respondent is, and at all times relevant herein has been, charged by law with the
15 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines, including (but not limited to)
16 the preparation of factually accurate and legally adequate environmental documentation for the
17 Project.

18 21. Petitioner has exhausted all legally available administrative remedies against
19 Respondent's decision to use a "Class 1" categorical exemption to approve the Project as being
20 in compliance with CEQA and the Guidelines. The decision of Respondent to approve the
21 Project is a final determination. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed for herein,

22 Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury for which it has no adequate remedy at law, there will
23 be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in this
24 action ineffectual.

25 22. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
26 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service, written notice of this action to Respondent.
27 A copy of the written notice Petitioner provided to Respondent is attached hereto as Exhibit A
28 and incorporated herein by this reference.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 23. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
2 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing a copy of this Verified Petition

3 for Writ of Mandate to the California Attorney General in accordance with Public Resources

4 Code section 21167.7.

5 ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

6 24. In the 1950s, the area now known as the Arcadia Highlands was developed.
a 7 (There are a scattering of perhaps five homes from the 1920s that pre-date this development.)
8 25. The major developer was George Elkins, who bought 14 tracts. Between 1948 and
9 1957, he established covenants, codes and restrictions ("CC&Rs") for the tracts that included
10 a design review component giving him exclusive design review of each proposed home.
11 26. George Elkins sold each lot to a "homeowner" and did not sell more than two lots
12 per a tract to a single developer because he was creating an affluent enclave and did not want
NNVI & NOINIIOOW CIOELHI A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13| "tract homes." He retained exclusive design review until the 1970s, at which time the residents
14 voted by a majority to adopt a "design review zone" which would allow design review to stay
15 within the purview of the residents. A homeowners association ("HOA") was enacted with
16 articles of incorporation and bylaws to oversee the appointment of the HOA's architectural
17 review board ("ARB"). The bylaws set out annual elections of the HOA board, and the board
18 then elects a president who in turn appoints the ARB chair.
19 27. Four other areas within the City adopted similar design review ordinances. All
20 five areas were given a "Design Review Zone" designation by the City.
21 28. In 1973, the Council adopted Resolution 4335 pursuant to City Ordinance 1479,
22 granting design review authority to the ARB already in existence under the Arcadia Highlands
23 HOA's CC&Rs which apply to the approximately 550 homes within the Arcadia Highlands
24 HOA's boundaries.

25 29. In 1986, the Council adopted Resolution 5289, superseding Resolution 4335, with
26 the qualification that "All findings and statements of purpose in related Resolutions which
27 preexisted this resolution or prior covenants, conditions, and restrictions constitute part of the
28 rationale for this Resolution and are incorporated by reference."

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 30. In 1994, the residents of an area adjacent to the 14 tracts of the George Elkins
2 development voted to join the Highlands Oaks HOA in response to "mansionization." (The City
3 was allowing the "mansionization" of South Arcadia but the HOAs established in North Arcadia

4 protected the design review zones.) That same year, the Council enacted Ordinance No. 2021,
5 adding approximately 300 more homes to the HOA's design review zone, noting "over 60% of
6 the homeowners within this area signed a petition in support of joining the Highlands Oaks
7 Homeowners Association," satisfying the criteria of Arcadia Municipal Code section 9272.2.5.

8 31. For years the HOAs enjoyed design review authority and exercised their power
9 according to the City's adopted Resolutions incorporating the HOAs' CC&Rs into City law.
10 Appeals to the Council were provided and were evaluated using the language:
11 "control of architectural appearance and use of materials shall not be so exercised
12 that individual initiative is stifled in creating the appearance of external features
13 of any particular structure, building, fence, wall or roof; except to the extent NOLI VHOJHOD TYNOISSTHONJ V NNVIN & NOCNITOIN ITOENHT 14 necessary to establish contemporary accepted standards of harmony and
15 compatibility acceptable to the ARB or the body hearing an appeal in order to
16 avoid that which is excessive, garish and substantially unrelated to the
17 neighborhood."

18 32. The Council decided appeals of ARB denials under a standard of review according
19 deference to the ARBs. For example, on June 17, 2003, the Council heard the appeal of the
20 Lower Rancho HOA/ARB's denial of a new front door at 821 San Vincente Road and denied

21 it because it found neither gross negligence nor abuse of discretion in the HOA/ARB's denial.
22 33. Similarly, on July 20, 2004, the Council upheld the Highlands Oaks HOA/ARB's
23 denial of a roof after the owner installed it without obtaining prior HOA/ARB approval.
24 34. On or about January 3, 2012, the Council adopted Resolution 6770 pursuant to
25 Ordinance 2285, to replace all five HOA Resolutions with a single resolution. However,
26 language for appeals was unaltered from 1986's Resolution 5289.
27 35. Resolution 6770 delegates design review responsibility in the Arcadia Highlands
28 to the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB, consisting of five elected residents. Pursuant to

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

3 Resolution 6770, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB is charged with reviewing building plans

4 for consistency with the principles of "harmonious design" directed by the City's General Plan
as well as the Single-Family Residential Design Review Guidelines the Council established in

5

6 2006, and updated in 2009, in response to (among other things) community concerns about
increased "mansionization" that was negatively impacting the City and home values.
36.

7 Resolution 6770 added that:

8
9 "The impacts on adjacent properties shall be addressed, including impacts on

10 privacy and views. First story and second story elements should be designed and
articulated to reasonably address these issues, and windows and balconies shall be

11 located to reasonably protect privacy and views of surrounding homes and yards."
37. Since July 2012, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB has reviewed applications to

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 12 replace or remodel 30 homes in Arcadia Highlands. Nearly all of these applications sought
13 drastic increases in square footage, and many applications more than doubled the size of the
14 existing homes. In contrast to the neighborhood's existing 850 homes, which average closer to
15 2,600 square feet, these new houses often exceeded 6,000 square feet and contained two master
16 bedroom suites, 2-3 additional bedrooms, multiple kitchens, multiple rooms that could be used
17

18 as additional bedrooms, and multiple entrances.

38.

19 Following the Council's adoption of the Development Code Update in 2016,
the City turned its attention to the Citywide Design Guidelines and Resolution No. 6770 as the
20 last set of documents that needed to be updated in order to implement the City's General Plan,
21 which was substantially updated in 2010. Because of the fast pace of mansionization develop-
22 ment in recent years and the change in the types of development being proposed, the guidelines
23 needed to be updated to provide clear and useful recommendations for the design,
24 construction, review, and approval of residential projects in the City.
25 39. On or about June 2018, Wu and WYF submitted an application to the Arcadia
26 Highlands HOA/ARB for its review of the initial version of their Project.
27 40. After objections were made at the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB's January 2019
28 hearing over the Project's height and massing, and inaccuracies in its architectural plans, the

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB requested the drawings be resubmitted, and the hearing was
2 continued.

3 41. On June 11, 2019, the continued hearing on the Project took place, and more

4 objections were raised regarding the Project's overall height, massing, compatibility, privacy and
5 obstructed views. The Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB requested additional modifications to the
6 Project's design, and the hearing was again continued.

7 42. On August 16, 2019, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB held a third hearing on the

8 Project. Due to continuing concerns over the Project's massing, height, neighborhood
compatibility, privacy, views, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB asked RPIs to put up story
10 poles. When RPIs refused this request, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB made the decision to
11 deny the Project. RPIs did not appeal that decision.
12 43. After working with stakeholders and the HOAs between 2016 and 2019 to update
NNVIN 3 NOINHIOOW CIOEHT A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 and modernize the Citywide Design Guidelines, on October 15, 2019, the Council adopted
14 Resolution 7272, amending regulations applicable to properties in the five single-family
15 homeowner's association architectural design zone areas.
16 44. The following month, RPIs submitted a new a regular review application to the
17 Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB for a modified version of their Project.
18 45. April 2, 2020, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB conducted a hearing on the
19 modified Project by teleconference. Due to continued concerns with overall mass, height, and
20 compatibility, the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB again asked RPIs for story poles. RPIs again
21 refused, and the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB voted unanimously (5-0) to deny the Project,
22 making written findings that the Project IS NOT consistent with the Resolution 7272 guidelines
23 and General Plan Policy LU-3.5. A true and correct copy of those findings is attached hereto
24 as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.
25 46. On April 13, 2020, RPIs filed an appeal. On May 26, 2020, that appeal was heard
26 by the City's Planning Commission. In response to City Planning Service staff recommending
27 approval of the Project, an AEP member submitted a written point-by-point rebuttal of staff's
28 report that ignored the written findings made by the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB in denying

1 the Project. A true and correct copy of this rebuttal is attached hereto as Exhibit C and

2 incorporated herein by reference.

3 47. the Planning Commission approved the Project with a few changes and a new

4 condition and, on June 8, 2020 an AEP member filed appeal of that decision to the Council. A

5 true and correct copy of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit D and incorporated herein by
6 reference.

7 48. On August 4, 2020, the Council opened the teleconference hearing on the appeal

8 of the Project and, by a vote of 4-1, denied the appeal and upheld the Planning Commission's
9 approval of the Project despite the findings of the Arcadia Highlands HOA/ARB.
10 49. CEQA notices are filed with and posted by the State Clearinghouse and/or the
11 Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, and the notices are made available to
12 download on their websites. As of September 9, 2020, a search of those websites shows that a

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION NNVW  NOUNIIOOW CIOHINT 13 CEQA Notice of Exemption for the Project has not been filed.
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Against Respondent)
16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17 50. Petitioner realleges paragraphs 1 through 49.

18 A. Violation of CEQA and the Guidelines:
19 51. CEQA serves two basic, interrelated functions: ensuring environmental protection
20 and encouraging governmental transparency. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors
21 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) It accomplishes this by requiring full disclosure of a project's
22 significant environmental effects so that decision-makers and the public are informed of these
23 consequences before project is approved to ensure government officials are held accountable
24 for these effects. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco v. Regents of the
25 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)
26 52. CEQA applies to all "governmental agencies at all levels" and requires lead
27 agencies to review the environmental impacts of all projects. Under Public Resources Code
28 section 21065, a project is any discretionary "activity which may cause either a direct physical

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 environment."

3 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

53.

4 CEQA directs the Governor's Office of Planning and Research to prepare the
CEQA Guidelines and to include in them "a list of classes of discretionary projects that have

7 been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and that shall be exempt
6 from [CEQA]."
54.

8 Section 15301 through 15033 of the CEQA Guidelines list the 33 "classes" of
projects that are "categorically exempt" from CEQA.
55.

10

11 However, these 33 categorical exemptions are not absolute, and section 15300.2

12 of the CEQA Guidelines specifies exceptions to them. For example, all classes of categorical
exemptions "are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive project of the same type

A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION LEIBOLD McCLENDON & MANN 13 in the same place, over time is significant."
56. In approving the Project, the City exempted it under a "Class 1" categorical
14 exemption for "existing facilities." It was the City's burden to prove the proposed Project fit
15 within this class of categorical exemption [California Farm Bureau Federation v. California
16 Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186], but the City failed to meet this
17 burden.

18 57.

19

20 As defined by CEQA Guidelines section 15355(b), "[t]he cumulative impact from
several projects is the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of
the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
21 probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively
22

23 significant projects taking place over a period of time."
58. Cumulative impact analysis is important because "One of the most important
24 environmental lessons evident from past experience is that environmental damage often occurs
25 incrementally from a variety of small sources." (Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford
26 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720.) For example, the court in San Franciscans for Reasonable
27 Growth v. City and County of San Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, found that, absent
28 meaningful cumulative analysis, there would never be any awareness or control over the speed

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and manner of development in downtown San Francisco and concluded that San Francisco's
2 refusal to take into account other similar development projects violated CEQA. (Id. at 634.)

3 "Without that control, 'piecemeal development would inevitably cause havoc in virtually every
4 aspect of the urban environment." (Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, at 720.)

5 59. Similarly, without an adequate cumulative analysis of the ongoing mansionization

6 of the City, the City is already losing control over development in its neighborhoods.

7 60. The City had before it incontrovertible evidence of the Project's cumulative

8 environmental impacts particularly in light of the fact that the City was previously sued and
settled another lawsuit challenging the ongoing mansionization of the City using categorical
10 exemptions. Despite this, the City still has not assessed impacts on aesthetics, neighborhood
11 character, traffic generation and congestion, noise, or any other impact area mandated by CEQA
12 caused by this ongoing process. Instead, the City has approached each proposed mansionization
NNVI  NOCNIIOOW IIOHTIT A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 project on a piecemeal, case-by-case basis and finding each one categorically exempt from
14 environmental review under CEQA.

15 61. The City's reliance on a "Class 1" categorical exemption for the Project further
16 violates CEQA because mansionization projects are having both direct and cumulative impacts
17 on historic resources. According to urban planner John Uniack, the Arcadia Highlands "has one
18 of the finest intact collections of mid-century suburban houses in Southern California." The
19 neighborhood's homes are unique, architect-designed homes, some by noted architects. The
20 original homes being targeted by these mansionization projects are over 50 years old, thereby
21 reaching the threshold for a historic resource review. Since mid-2012, more than 30 of these

22 homes have been slated for demolition or disfigurement.
23 62. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require environmental review to evaluate the
24 "whole of a project" and not simply its constituent parts when determining whether it will have
25 a significant environmental effect.
26 63. The City's practice of approving individual mansionization projects - each with a
27 categorical exemption to avoid environmental review - is causing widespread mansionization
28 in the Arcadia Highlands without any consideration of the aesthetic, traffic, noise, energy, or

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 other impacts of increased population density in the neighborhood. This piecemeal allowance
2 of increased building size and reduced setbacks without any consideration of whether the

3 projects are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood is effectively nullifying the City's

4 Single-Family Residential Design Review Guidelines for the Arcadia Highlands without

5 environmental review. The California Supreme Court has cautioned that "environmental

6 considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones
7 each with a minimal potential impact on the environment - which cumulatively may have
8 disastrous consequences." (Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Commission (1975) 13 Cal.3d
9 263, 284.) Simply put, "A public agency is not permitted to subdivide a single project into
10 smaller individual subprojects in order to avoid the responsibility of considering the
11 environmental impact of the project as V. whole." (Orinda Assn v. Board of Supervisors (1986)
12| 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.)
NNVW Y NOMNTIOOW I'IOEIIT A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 13 64. Categorical exemptions also "shall not be used for an activity where there is a
14 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to
15 unusual circumstances."

16 65. Here, the Project is "unusual" to say the least, because it does not even qualify for
17 a "Class 1" categorical exemption. CEQA Guidelines section 15301 states (in pertinent part)
18 that the "Class 12 categorical exemption can be used for "[a]dditions to existing structures
19 provided that the addition will not result in an increase of more than: (1) 50 percent of the floor
20 area of the structures before the addition, or 2,500 square feet, whichever is less... ." (Italics
21 added.) According to the staff report prepared by the City's own Planning Service, the original
22 Wu home, built in 1960, is 1,960 square feet. The Project consists of a total of 3,360 square feet:
23 a 1,400 square foot expansion that is greater than 50 percent of the size of the original home.
24 66. Consequently, before the City may lawfully approve the Project, it needed to
25 prepare an initial study that addressed all potentially significant impacts of the Project-as well
26 as the ongoing mansionization in the City that is destroying its unique aesthetic character,

Findings and Action Report

File No.: 0-009-2019 _Date: 4/2/2020

Project Address: 2011 Highland Oaks Dr.

Applicant: WYF Architecture
Owner (if different) _fulie Wu
Project Description: Complete remodel/redesign and addition of second story

FINDINGS

I. SITE PLANNING - The proposed project IS NOT consistent with the Site Planning Guidelines. Setbacks, heights, proportions, rooflines, and architectural features of the new construction second story do not complement the building orientation due to the roof line over 2 of the front windows calling additional attention to the height of the structure, the rooflines having additional pitch over a 3:12 pitch and the second floor plate height in excess of the first story plate height which all added additional height and mass to a home that is oriented well above street level. However, the proposed addition to existing homes does consider the potential for impacts on privacy of neighbors by having only one window on each of the South and North sides of the second story and having the glass on those windows obscured.
II. MASSING - The proposed project IS NOT consistent with the Massing Guidelines. The finish
elevation of the foundation is roughly u feet above the street at the center of the home and with the
proposed new structure with a height of 24 feet and 9 inches, the top of this structure would be approximately 36 feet above the street which presents massing and scale issues in comparison to the neighboring homes. The height of this structure could have been partially mitigated with a lesser pitch roof and a lower plate height on the second floor. Objective 3 of the City's Single-Family Residential Design Guidelines is to ensure home additions are consistent in scale and massing with the
surrounding neighborhood. This objective is not being met when the proposed home is starting roughly one story above the street and then needlessly adding additional overall height to the structure that will be effectively 3 stories above the street. Building elements that emphasize a structure's verticality were also included in the design over two of the three windows on the second
story,

HII. FRONTAGE CONDITIONS - The proposed project IS NOT consistent with the Frontage Condition Guidelines. Homes should not have significantly greater height at the front of a property than that of adjacent homes. Adjacent homes are single story or split level homes and the proposed
Page 1 of 4

second story addition may be seen from the street and adds needless additional height: to the second
floor due to the second floor plate height and elements in the roofline that emphasize the
structure's verticality.
IV. GARAGES & DRIVEWAYS - The proposed project IS consistent with the existing structure of the
garages and driveways.
V. ARCHITECTURAL STYLE - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines. Homes in
the immediate neighborhood exhibit siding and nature stone at the base of the home.
VI. HEIGHT, BULK & SCALE - The proposed project IS NOT consistent with the Guidelines. The
proposed second floor plate height of 9 feet does not consider existing second story plate heights
established within the immediate neighborhood of 8.5 feet Or less. Including a larger plate height than the first floor and what is established in the area adds to the overall height of the proposed
home and a roof peak à that would be roughly 36 feet above the street. The proposed structure's size
and bulk does not complement the predominant massing types of the neighborhood.
VII. ROOFLINES - The proposed project IS consistent with the Roofline Guidelines based on the roof
plan and material (concrete tiles) being compatible with the Highlands requirements. The roof plan is
compatible with the proposed architectural style and design of the home. However, elements in the
roofline do emphasize the structure's verticality which emphasizes that the second story eves ate
approximately three stories in height above the street.
VIII. ENTRY - The proposed project IS consistent with the Entry Guidelines. The proposed entry
addition is architecturally compatible with the style of the proposed project.
IX. WINDOWS & DOORS - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines. The window
placement and window material on the second story have been designed to minimize direct views
into neighboring residences and actively-used outdoor spaces of neighboring properties.
X. ARTICULATION - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines. The second story
windows and surrounding window structure provide articulation that provides interest through the use
of thoughtful integiation of key elements while avoiding a disordered appearance.
XI. FACADE DESIGN - The proposed project IS generally consistent with the Facade Design Guidelines based on the home's overall design.
XII. COLORS & MATERIALS - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines. The
proposed project utilizes stone at the base of the home and an earth tone color pallet.
XIII. ACCESSORY LIGHTING - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines.
XIV. ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines for Additions and Alterations as it does exhibit a consistent architecture style throughout, largely due to the entire exterior being remodeled within the proposed scope.
XV. - HILLSIDE PROPERTIES - The proposed project IS NOT consistent with the Guidelines. It is
questionable if the second story step-backs from downhill slope to the street are adequate to
Page 2 of 4

mitigate height, bulk and scale issues due to the existing topography. Some of the roof pitches are not parallel with the existing slopes and therefore emphasize the structure's verticality. The proposed project does minimize the need for additional grading.
XVI. - FENCES, WALLS, GATES, & HEDGES - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines and most of the materials are existing.
XVIT. LANDSCAPE & HARDSCAPE - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines. Existing landscaping is to remain and hardscape design is proposed to be consistent with the
existing.

IX. FENCES & WALLS • The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines for Fences and Walls.

X. ARCHITECTURAL STYLE - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines.
XI. ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS - The proposed project IS consistent with the Guidelines for Additions and Alterations as it does exhibit a consistent architecture style throughout due to the entire exterior being remodeled within the proposed scope.

XIII. MINIMUM FLOOR AREA & SETBACKS - The proposed project IS consistent with the Minimum Floor Area and Setback Guidelines. However, it would be the largest home on the subject street that is within 300 feet. It would also have the greatest floor area ratio ("FAR"), at 0.262 to 1. The subject's proposed FAR is in excess of 30% greater than the average of the homes with 300 feet of the subject property.
XIV. AFFECT ON ADJACENT PROPERTIES & NEIGHBORHOOD - The General Plan Land Use Policy LU-3.5 requires that, "new construction, additions, renovations, and infill developments be sensitive to neighborhood context, building form, scalc and colors." The proposed project is not consistent with the Single-Family Residential Design Guidelines primarily due to the scale of the project in the context of the topography of the subject parcel. The proposed project does not integrate design that mitigates the massing and scale issues with respect to the streetscape as well as adjoining properties.

EXHIBIT C

Rebuttal to Planning Service Staff Report
Planning Commission Appeal Hearing 5/26/2020
Regarding a 2-story Addition Project at 2011 Highland Oaks Dr.

The Planning Service has issued a staff report, which recommends conditional approval
of the two-story project. However, several findings deserve attention.

Privacy Concerns

Figure 1 of the report exhibits an outdated photo of the subject property showing
overgrown trees that hide the property from its southern neighbor. However, those trees
are presently trimmed to be much smaller than what is shown in the photo, which
exposes the property to observers from every viewing angle (e.g., from Elkins Ave).
Natural barriers, including trees, may be removed in the future for various reasons,
further exposing privacy.

The staff findings include the statement *ARB did not state any concerns with privacy
impacts." Yet, its analysis includes the statement "second story addition...mitigates
privacy concerns of both...neighbors by adding only one window on each side" which
contradicts the initial finding of no privacy impacts. The report also states "neither of
these windows will have any direct sightlines into adjacent homes...impacts to
privacy….not anticipated", which is false. Privacy concerns were raised at all four
ARB hearings. The ARB report dated 4/2/2020 summarized "having only one window
on each….South and North sides of the second story..glass on those windows
obscured." However, the moment those windows are opened, the occupants would
have a direct view into neighboring properties. And while the West facing windows on
the second story would also view into neighboring properties and pose privacy issues,
no modification to the West facing windows were made to address significant privacy
concerns. At the minimum, the North and South facing windows of the second story
should be removed and not simply obscured.

Comparisons with Three Larger Houses

The staff report compares the proposed project of 3,360 SF total living space to three
larger properties:

2011 Oaks Place: 3714 SF, a single-story
2032 Elkins Place: 4052 SF, a two-story

2025 Elkins Place: 3614 SF, a split-level

The staff's comparisons don't support the proposed two-story project because of the
following reasons. First of all, 2011 Oaks a Place is a single-story and has a much larger
lot size. In addition, single-story additions will be allowed without any ARB public hearing regardless of lot size or location so long as there are no significant changes in height, mass, etc.. Secondly, 2032 Elkins Place was a highly contested project
decades ago and was allowed to proceed on a large scale despite considerable
neighborhood protest. It is simply not convincing to use a grandfathered "mistake"
(per current design standard) allowed by the Planning Dept. decades ago as an
example for comparison.

Fast forward to the present date, and again many neighbors are against the
two-story project at the 2011 H.O. location due to its inappropriate size and mass for
the location. It is many neighbors' desire and determination that no designs such as the one at 2032 Elkins Place should be allowed on the narrower and steeper part of the
street of Highland Oaks Drive just north of Elkins Ave. Many neighbors driving by or
walking by this part of Highland Oaks Drive can see the tall 2-story house of 2032
Elkins Place, which exposes itself without any barriers and negatively affects the
streetscape of its neighboring street.

Finally, 2025 Elkins Place is a split-level (1.5-story) house since it sits on uneven
ground. The garage sits on the lower side (south) and the upper floor directly above it is
relatively small compared to the first-floor on the higher side (north) and in the back. In
addition, the huge front-yard setback on the lower side helps minimize the visual impact of the upper floor. Most importantly, the foundations on both the lower side (south) and the higher side (north) are not much higher than the street. The entire property at 2011 H.O., however, sits 12 feet above the street.

Comparison with 2017 H.O.

The staff report mistakenly states that 2017 H.O. is "not much larger than the proposed
project" when in fact it is smaller than the proposed project at 2011 H.O.. Indeed,
approval of this project would result in the subject property "having the largest home
along this portion of Highland Oaks Drive". Given the fact that the lot size of 2011 H.O.
is one of the smallest on the block and it sits 12 feet above the street, it is neither
harmonious nor compatible to build the biggest 2-story house of the block on this site.

As for the owner at 2011 H.O., in her appeal letter, the owner makes repeated reference
to her north neighbor's home at 2017 H.O., a split-level house that was completely
rebuilt from the ground up in 2013. In 2011 or 2012, the City's Planning Dept. approved
the demolition of the old house and yard and approved the complete rebuild of the
current house without any HOA/ARB public hearing, even if there were obviously
significant changes in height, mass, size, and architectural style. If standard procedures
were followed by allowing for public input, that structure would not have existed today,
as it continues to receive considerable negative reviews from many neighbors. That
structure would not have been a focal point of comparison for the owner of 2011 H.O.
had the City's Planning Dept. requested a proper HOA/ARB public hearing. Therefore, it
is inappropriate to compare one's project to an architectural "mistake".

Consequences of Insensitive Designs and Development

Elkins Place (the street west of Highland Oaks Dr, north of Elkins Ave) provides many
examples of what happens when large scale developments are approved in this
community. Around 1992, the 4052 SF two-story mansion was proposed and built at
2032 Elkins Place despite considerable neighborhood protest. It was approved by the
City despite repeated objections from neighbors. This paved the way for the
construction of a 4772 SF two-story mansion next to it at it 2038 Elkins Place, which
was built around 2009. The project also faced heavy protests from neighbors, but the
Planning Dept. approved it nevertheless. In 2017, a 4807 SF two-story house with a
basement was proposed and approved at 2039 Elkins Place, which is currently under
construction. The new house is now taller than both the split-level on the south, at
2035 Elkins Place, and the split-level on the north, at 2045 Elkins Place.

Did the neighbors anticipate the inharmonious height difference? Perhaps a story pole
demonstration would have led the community to request a reduction in the second-story
a roof to a more reasonable height. Neighbors can only expect the next two-story project
to come along and outdo the 4807 SF two-story at 2039 Elkins Place. These are the
many examples that should concern all members of this community.

The homeowners along the 2000 block of Highland Oaks. as well as the majority of this
community, do not want the progression of increasingly larger two-story homes being
built on the relatively narrower street of Highland Oaks, as the two-story houses will
inevitably block the views of many neighbors on this part of Highland Oaks. The
approval of a two-story home at 2011 Highland Oaks would surely trigger this surge in
development.

Horizontal Additions Possible

Backyard Space

Another concern raised in the staff report is whether an addition in the backyard of 2011 H.O. is practical. It finds that the 1,140 SF can be accomplished by covering "3/4 of the total rear yard area." This would require the "existing swimming pool..to be removed." The owner had already planned on redesigning the pool in order to build additional first floor living space. Therefore, removing the pool, and extending the first floor living space further back can achieve the increased living space of 1,140 SF without adding on any second floor. This would still leave some rear yard space for a garden or play area. This is highly practical as it would accomplish the desired living space without harming the neighborhood enjoyment of views, privacy, and harmonious compatibility in the community.

As can be seen from the aerial view, 2011 H.O. has a relatively much larger flat backyard than its adjacent neighboring properties on the west side of the 2000 block of Highland Oaks Dr. Therefore, for 2011 H.O., even with the current reduced-size pool plan, there is plenty of space on the south side of the backyard for significant first-floor addition, which will reduce the size of the second floor or eliminate it all together.

Subground Garage

Since the owner of 2011 H.O. identifies with the north neighbor's architectural style, she has the option to use the space in front of her garage and relocate her garage underneath there by creating a subground garage under her first floor living space, which would allow considerable first floor remodeling without adding on a second story. 2011 H.O. could incorporate the existing garage into its first floor living space, and create a garage that sits underneath the living area. This design would enable attaining the same living space that 2017 H.O. has accomplished, without having to remove the pool, and keeping the entire backyard as a play area.

The Story Poles

The story poles requested by the ARB are appropriate because it is unclear from it the architectural drawings how tall the overall structure will be relative to both adjacent properties. In fact, the measurements indicate that the proposed two-story structure will

exceed the height of the property to the north. In addition, the architectural drawings
have demonstrated several shortcomings during each variation of submission. The
photos have been outdated showing landscape and trees that were large, but which
have been significantly cut back since then. Furthermore, the drawings show that
properties at 2011 H.O. and 2017 H.O. have the same roof-top level. How could this be,
if the height of 2017 H.O. measures 28'2", and the height of the proposed two-story at
2011 H.O. measures 28'9" (relative to the foundation of 2017 H.O.)?

The owner states in her appeal letter "the completed project will never be perceived as the 2-D drawings depict." That statement does support the ARB's concerns that the
existing 2-D drawings fail to show the massing effect that story poles would clarify.
Therefore, it is necessary to have a story-pole setup in order for everyone involved,
whether expert or untrained observer, to see the actual mock up, in order to ensure that
the structure being built actually reflects what is shown on 2-D drawings.

Furthermore, the architectural drawings indicate that a 6-foot person standing at the curb may or may not perceive the height of the roof. However, the massing effect and
its impact on the neighbors are not limited to the view at this single focal point, but
rather can be perceived at various points along the curb (keeping in mind the varying
front-yard setbacks from the north to the south along the street), at the opposite curb,
and from the perspective of all neighboring homeowners. Therefore, it is fully justified to
request a story pole demonstration in order to fully evaluate the massing effect of this
proposed structure, and to ensure that the community will not be significantly affected
by adding an upper level at this specific location, where the foundation is 12 feet higher
than the curb and the street slopes upward.

ARB vs. Planning Department

In her appeals letter, the owner states that she addressed the issue of story poles with the City Planning Administrator, "the ARB was then informed that they cannot ask
homeowners to do what is non-standard." Why would the owner make this statement,
which suggests that the City Planning Department is speaking on behalf of the ARB? If
the City Planning is directly influencing the ARB in their review of homeowner's projects,
what is the purpose of the ARB? Is there not already in place a process of review by the
ARB, and an appeals process with the Planning Commission and City Council, which
establishes the relative independence of the ARB?

Factors for a More Reasonable Second-Story Addition

If, however, a second-story addition is the Planning Commission's determination, the
owner should be asked to reduce the size of the second story (by adding more
first-floor space towards the backyard as discussed before) and to shift the second
story further towards the north. The owner proposes a second story with a 24' 4"
setback from the south neighbor versus a 24'11" setback from the north neighbor.
Because of the following two reasons, It will be more appropriate to shift the second
story towards the north by at least another 6 feet: 1) the existing property has a
much larger front-yard setback on the north side than on the south side (45'7" on the
north corner vs. 34'10" on the south corner), and 2) the two-story house at 2011 H.O.
will be much taller than the house at 2001 H.O. but will be of similar height as the house
at 2017 H.O.. This shift northward would have the effect of grouping two similarly-sized
masses, while minimizing the mismatch in size when juxtaposed with the smaller,
single-story structure at 2011 H.O.. In addition, the second-story windows on the north
and south sides should be removed to mitigate privacy issues, as discussed earlier.

Furthermore, the second-story plate height should be reduced to 8'0", which would
reduce the overall height an additional 6", as the height of the first floor is 8'0" and "the
new second floor should match the height of the first floor". The second-floor plate
height of 8 feet is not unheard of, as it is part of the design of the second-story addition
proposed at 2200 Highland Vista Drive, whose owner has also removed windows facing
north and south for privacy issues in expressing a desire to minimize the height impact
of his two-story addition upon the neighbors and community.

These changes, which include reducing the size of the second story, shifting the
second floor further north, removing north and south facing windows on the
second floor to preserve privacy, along with reducing the second story plate to 8'0",
and reducing the roof pitch to 3:12, will help to reduce the roof height, reduce
massing, and decrease the impact upon the neighbors.

EXHIBIT D

The Planning Commission issued a decision on May 26 to overturn the ARB's denial ruling and grant approval of the two-story project at 2011 HOD. I am appealing this decision because I believe a two story project is inappropriate for this location in this neighborhood. Furthermore, am appealing because the Planning Commission based its decision on the summary report provided by the City Planning Department, which was flawed in its analysis and which neglected to sufficiently address many concerns and objections to the two-story project that have been raised by neighbors since its inception. In addition, the Planning Commission neglected to pursue path of careful in-depth, fact-finding analysis prior to rendering its quick decision.
Resolution No. 7272 Design Guideline Violations:
The Design Guidelines outlined in Resolution 7272 and referenced in the Planning report call upon the consideration of "impacts of...remodels, additions, alterations…on adjacent properties….including impacts on privacy and views.' Furthermore "windows and second-floor....should be located to minimize direct
views into neighboring residences and actively-used outdoor spaces of neighboring properties." "Landscaping should not obstruct..views enjoyed by…adjacent properties." "The stronger the existing neighborhood pattern, the more important it is for an owner to reinforce and respect those existing patterns."
The proposed two-story project at 2011 HOD has violated the above quoted design guidelines. Details of the violations will be given in subsequent paragraphs.
Concerns on Strong Existing Neighborhood Patterns:
The existing patterns that are strongly in place in this neighborhood include mountain/city views and harmonious and compatible single story, traditional, Ranch style homes that line the 2000 block of Highland Oaks Drive. These existing features should be respected and reinforced as referenced in Resolution 7272, since these features are the main reasons that residents are attracted to this
area of the Arcadia Highlands.
The proposed two story structure, sitting 12 feet above the street, will disturb these existing patterns, as it will appear like a pinnacle when compared with its lower- level neighbors on the south and on the east. Furthermore, the 1,140 SF new, second story structure will block the city views from its northern neighbors and from the neighbor at 2026 Elkins Place, when these neighbors are standing in their backyards looking south.
Privacy Concerns:

Figure of the report exhibits an outdated photo of the subject property showing overgrown trees that hide the property from its southern neighbor. However, those trees are presently trimmed to be much smaller than what is shown in the photo, which exposes the property to observers from every viewing angle (e.g., from

"foliage (to) reduce visual massing", including trees, as these may be removed in the future for various reasons, further exposing privacy.
The Planning staff findings include the statement "ARB did not state any concerns with privacy impacts." Yet, its analysis includes the ARB statement "second story addition.mitigates privacy concerns of both..neighbors by adding only one window on each side" which conflicts with the Planning staff's initial statement of no
privacy impacts. The report also states "neither of these windows will have any direct sightlines into adjacent homes..impacts to privacy.not anticipated", which is incorrect. Privacy concerns were raised at all four ARB hearings. The ARB Findings and Action Report dated April 2 summarizes a recommendation regarding "impacts on privacy of neighbors by having only one window on eachSouth and North sides of the second story and having the glass on those windows obscured." Clearly, the ARB was concerned by privacy issues to recommend obscure glass on the south and north facing, second story windows.
However, the problem with obscuring the glass, instead of altering the placement of the windows, is that when windows are open, the occupants are given a direct view into neighboring properties. The hedges along the north property line are not
very tall. Thus, the north facing, second story window will be seen from the street
looking directly into its neighbor's backyard. The same will be true for the south facing, second story window, especially whenever the hedges along the south property line are cut short or damaged/removed for any reason.
While the west facing windows on the second story also have direct views into neighboring properties and pose privacy issues, no modification to the west facing windows were made to address significant privacy concerns (reference Resolution 7272). Although the owner has argued that the west facing windows are required for lighting and ventilation, the windows can be elevated above 6 feet to serve that purpose and eliminate the direct view into neighboring properties.
However, the north and south facing windows are unnecessary for lighting and ventilation, as the west facing windows address these requirements for the second story rooms. Therefore, the north and south facing windows should be eliminated
for privacy concerns as discussed above. At the minimum, they should be elevated above 6 feet and not simply obscured, if they cannot be eliminated from
the design.

Comparisons with Three Larger Houses:

The staff report compares the proposed project of 3,360 SF, total living space to three larger properties:

2011 Oaks Place: 3,714 SF, a single story;
2025 Elkins Place: 3,614 SF a split-level; 2032 Elkins Place: 4,052 SF, a two story.

The staff's comparisons don't support the proposed two story project because of the following reasons. First of all, 2011 Oaks Place is a single story and has a much larger lot size. In addition, single story additions will be allowed without any
ARB public hearing regardless of lot size or location. Secondly, 2032 Elkins Place was a highly contested project decades ago and was allowed to proceed on a large scale despite considerable neighborhood protest. It is simply not convincing to use a grandfathered "mistake" (per current design standard) allowed by the Planning Dept. decades ago as an example for comparison.
Fast forward to the present date, and again many neighbors are against the two story project at 2011 HOD due to its inappropriate size and mass for the location, which is well summarized in the ARB report outlining issues "due to the scale of
the project in the context of the topography of the subject parcel", and it "does not integrate design that mitigates the massing and scale issues with respect to the streetscape (and)..adjoining properties. It is many neighbors' desire and determination that no designs such as the one at 2032 Elkins Place should be allowed on the narrower and steeper part of the street of Highland Oaks Drive just north of Elkins Ave. Many neighbors driving by or walking by this part of Highland Oaks Drive can see the tall two story house of 2032 Elkins Place, which exposes itself without any barriers and negatively affects the streetscape of its neighboring street.

Finally, 2025 Elkins Place is a split-level (1.5 story) house since it sits on uneven ground. The garage sits on the lower side (south), and the upper level directly above it is relatively small compared to the first floor on the higher side (north) and in the back. In addition, the huge front yard setback on the lower side helps minimize the visual impact of the upper level. Most important of all, the foundations
on both the lower side (south) and the higher side (north) are not much higher than the street. The entire property at 2011 HOD, however, sits 12 feet above the
street.

Comparison with 2017 Highland Oaks:

The staff report mistakenly states that 2017 HOD is "not much larger than the proposed project" when in fact it is smaller than the proposed project at 2011 HOD. Indeed, approval of this project would result in the subject property "having the largest home along this portion of Highland Oaks Drive". Given the fact that the lot size of 2011 HOD is one of the smallest on the block and it sits 12 it feet above the street, it is neither harmonious nor compatible to build the biggest two story house on this site.

As for the owner at 2011 HOD, in her appeals letter, the owner makes repeated
reference to her north neighbor's home at 2017 HOD, a split-level house that was
completely rebuilt from the ground up in 2013. In 2011 or 2012, the City's Planning Dept. approved the demolition of the old house and yard and approved the

complete rebuild of the current house without any HOA/ARB public hearing, even if there were obviously significant changes in height, mass, size, and architectural style. If standard procedures were followed by allowing for public input, that structure would not have existed today, as it continues to receive considerable negative reviews from many neighbors. That structure would not have been a focal point of comparison for the owner of 2011 HOD had the City's Planning Dept. requested a proper HOA/ARB public hearing. Therefore, it is inappropriate to compare one's project to an architectural "mistake".
Consequences of Insensitive Designs and Development:
Elkins Place (the street west of Highland Oaks Dr, north of Elkins Ave) provides many examples of what happens when large-scale developments are approved in this community. Around 1992, the 4052 SF, two story mansion was proposed and built at 2032 Elkins Place despite considerable neighborhood protest. It was approved by the City despite repeated objections from neighbors. This paved the way for the construction of a 4772 SF, two story mansion next to it at 2038 Elkins Place, which was built around 2009. The project also faced heavy protests from neighbors, but the Planning Dept. approved it nevertheless. In 2017, a 4807 SF, two story house with a basement was proposed and approved at 2039 Elkins Place, which is currently under construction. The new house is now taller than both the split-level on the south, 2035 Elkins Place, and the split-level on the north, 2045 Elkins Place. The unmitigated large-scale, two story developments that are permitted throughout this neighborhood have cumulative impacts on views, natural resources, population density that exact a heavy strain and irreversible toll on the Arcadia Highlands.
In regards to the development at 2039 Elkins Place, did the neighbors anticipate the inharmonious height difference? Perhaps a story pole demonstration would have led the community to request a reduction in the second story roof to a more reasonable height. Neighbors can only expect the next two story project to come along and outdo the 4807 SF, two story structure at 2039 Elkins Place. These are the many examples that should concern all members of this community.
The homeowners along the 2000 block of Highland Oaks Dr, as well as the majority of this community, do not want the progression of increasingly larger, two story homes being built on the relatively narrower street of Highland Oaks, as the two story houses will inevitably block the views of many neighbors on this part of Highland Oaks. The approval of a two story home at 2011 HOD would surely trigger this surge in development, with significant environmental impacts.
Environmental Impacts:

The staff report neglects to consider the environmental impact of expanding the additional first floor living space, altering the backyard landscape, reshaping the pool, handling/removing hazardous waste, in the absence of soil studies to a determine the effect of adding a second story, excavation, altering the topography

in a hillside terrain, and the potential adverse effect on neighbors' health and living environment.

In mandating that "landscape screening..be installed along the southern property line between the homes at the project site and 2001 Highland Oaks Drive", that "this condition shall be met by the existing trees on the project site", the Planning Commission neglects to consider the location of the trees and their adverse impact, including obstruction of views (reference Resolution 7272) and damage to neighboring property. In this situation, the trees referenced in the Planning Commission Decision Letter are toppling the cement retaining wall that protects
the property at 2001 HOD. Environmental impact analysis would uncover the risks posed by the City's insistence on the retention of the trees, that these trees may need to be treated, modified, possibly removed immediately to mitigate property damage, which would also lead to exposure of neighbors' privacy. The dependence on three trees to fully address the widely expressed privacy issues is misguided at this time, particularly in the absence of a more thorough environmental quality and impact analysis. One Planning Commissioner did ask the other members to engage in a more thorough, in-depth, fact-finding analysis- while referencing many of the concerns raised by project opponents--rather than rush to render an immediate decision on the project.
The environmental impact of the two story addition should also be considered within the context of the ensuing two story projects to develop along this street of single story, Ranch style homes, as an approval of this project would encourage
homeowners to build upward instead of into their backyards, for a multitude of reasons, including recapturing scenic views. The cascade of ensuing building developments throughout the neighborhood creates a cumulative environmental impact that is harmful and which must be anticipated and which should be analyzed, so that steps can be taken beforehand to mitigate the damage. Look no further than Elkins Place, an adjacent street to the west, where incrementally larger and larger two story structures have developed in close succession. While a single large scale project has obvious environmental impact, a collection of relatively small-scale projects has the potential to exert significant, cumulative, harmful environmental impact.
This sampling list underscores the multitude of two-story projects in the Arcadia Highlands, along with the aforementioned developments on Elkins Place, that were recently approved or built, or are seeking approval: 276 Monte Place, 270 Monte Place, 211 Monte Place, 2146 Canyon Road, 2125 Canyon Road, 2200 Highland Vista Dr, 2216 Highland Oaks Dr, 2020 Highland Oaks Dr, 1727 Highland Oaks Dr, 1129 Highland Oaks Dr, 11 E. Orange Grove Ave. The environmental impact of these many large-scale projects and their close proximity to fire zones cannot be overemphasized.

Cumulative impact analysis is important because history has shown that environmental damage often occurs from the accumulation of a variety of relatively smaller projects over time. The City has not addressed the impacts on the

neighborhood character, natural resources, increased runoff, effects on water quality, fire risk, energy consumption, traffic and noise pollution, among various
other vital considerations mandated by CEQA.

Horizontal Addition Possible:

Backyard Space

Another concern raised in the staff report is whether an addition in the backyard of
2011 HOD is practical. It finds that the 1,140 SF can be accomplished by covering "3/4 of the total rear yard area." This would require the "existing swimming pool..to be removed." The owner had already planned on redesigning the pool in order to build additional first floor living space. Therefore, removing the pool, and extending the first floor living space further back can achieve the increased living space of 1,140 SF, without adding on any second floor. This would still leave some rear yard space for a garden or play area. This is highly practical as it would accomplish the desired living space without harming the neighborhood enjoyment of views, privacy, and harmonious compatibility in the community.
As can be seen from the aerial view found in the Planning report, 2011 HOD has a
relatively much bigger, flat backyard than its adjacent neighboring properties on the west side of the 2000 block of Highland Oaks Dr. Therefore, for 2011 HOD, even with the current reduced-size pool plan, there is plenty of space on the south side of the backyard for significant first floor addition, which will reduce the size of the second floor or eliminate it all together.

Subground Garage
Since the owner of 2011 HOD identifies with the north neighbor's architectural style, she is encouraged to incorporate the existing garage into the first floor living space and relocate the garage by digging underneath the top of the steep driveway in front of her existing garage to create a subground garage. The area above this subground garage can be additional living space, which would allow considerable first floor addition without adding on a second story. This design would result in a much flatter driveway and enable attaining the same living space that 2017 HOD has accomplished, without having to remove the pool, and keeping the entire backyard as a play area.

The Story Poles

The story poles requested by the ARB are appropriate because it is unclear from
the architectural drawings how tall the overall structure will be relative to both adjacent properties. In fact, the measurements indicate that the proposed two story structure will exceed the height of the property to the north. In addition, the
architectural drawings have demonstrated several shortcomings during each variation of submission. The photos have been outdated showing landscape and

trees that were large, but which have been significantly cut back since then. Furthermore, the renditions show that properties on 2011 HOD and 2017 HOD have the same rooftop level. How could this be, if the height of 2017 HOD measures 28'2", and the height of the proposed two-story at 2011 HOD measures 28'9", relative to the foundation of 2017 HOD?

The owner states in her appeal letter "the completed project will never be perceived as the 2-D drawings depict." That statement does support the ARB's concerns that the existing 2-D drawings fail to show the massing effect that story poles would clarify. Therefore, it is necessary to have a story pole setup in order for everyone involved, whether expert or untrained observer, to see the actual mock up, in order to ensure that the structure being built actually reflects what is
shown on 2-D drawings.

Furthermore, the architectural drawings indicate that a 6 foot person standing at the curb may or may not perceive the height of the roof. However, the massing effect and its impact on the neighbors is not limited to the view at this single focal point, but rather can be impressive at various points along the curb (keeping in mind the varying setbacks from the north versus the south along the street), at the opposite curb, and from the perspective of all neighboring homeowners. Therefore, it is fully justified to request a story pole demonstration in order to fully appreciate the massing effect of this proposed structure, and ensure that the community won't be harmed by adding an upper level at this specific location, where the foundation is 12 feet higher than the curb and the street slopes upward.

Factors for a More Reasonable Second-Story Addition:

The excessive height of the proposed two-story structure has been a recurrent
concern to the ARB as well as City Planning. The ARB Findings and Action Report states "the proposed project IS NOT consistent with ..Guidelines..the rooflines having additional pitch over a 3:12 pitch and the second floor plate height in excess of the first story plate height." The ARB expressed concern that the project "all added additional height and mass to a home that is oriented well above street
level." The ARB report further reiterates this concern by stating, "needlessly
adding additional overall height to the structure that will be effectively 3 stories
above the street." And despite the Architectural Plan design in its current form,
with the second story setback, the ARB report emphasizes the lack of consistency with Frontage Guidelines, "homes should not have significantly greater height at the front of a property than that of adjacent homes." These concerns resulted in a unanimous decision to deny the project.
The City Planning staff also expressed concern regarding massing when it stated in its analysis supporting a "reduction in the roof pitch going from 4:12 to 3:12". The analysis also calls for a "lowering of the second floor plate height...to be consistent with the first floor height." It further states "the new second floor should
match the height of the first floor, which is echoed in the ARB Findings and Action Report. However, the Planning staff recommended a lowering of the "second floor

plate height from 9 feet to 8.5 feet." The Plans show that the existing first floor height is 8 feet, which should have led the Planning staff to recommend lowering the second floor plate height from 9 feet to 8 feet. 8
On May 28, had a conversation with City Planning & Community Development Administrator Lisa Flores. asked her about the point I had raised at the May 26 Planning Commission hearing on lowering the second floor plate height from 9 feet to feet. Lisa stated that it would not match the first floor height which she claimed was 8.5 feet. I attempted to correct her by referencing the Architectural Plans showing the first floor height at 8 feet, but instead of reviewing the Plans to confirm accuracy, she adamantly stated it was 8.5 feet. believe that the Planning staff would have recommended to the Planning Commission lowering the second floor
plate height from 9 feet to 8 feet, if they had not mistakenly believed the existing first floor height to be 8.5 feet. That recommendation would be consistent with the ARB recommendation to bring the second floor plate height down in line with the
first story plate height, as explained earlier. The City Planning analysis would then read as follows: "This would result in decreasing the overall height and thereby minimizing the overall massing of the structure when viewed from the street by 2 feet, with a new height of 22'-9" (proposed at 24'-9")".
must also point out an error here in the City Planning analysis which states "ARB asserted that the height of the proposed structure could be additionally reduced with.a lower plate height of 8.5 feet or less on the second floor." The ARB did not make this assertion in its Facts and Finding Report dated April 2. Instead, the ARB
states, "the second floor plate height in excess of the first story plate height..added additional height and mass". This statement expresses concern for a second floor plate height that exceeds the first story plate height, which contributes to the undesirable size and massing effect. The ARB report goes on to state, "the proposed second floor plate height of 9 feet does not consider existing second
story plate heights established within the immediate neighborhood of 8.5 feet or
less." Taking both statements together, one should interpret the ARB findings as a recommendation that the second floor plate height match the first story plate height, which the Plans show to be currently 8 feet and which would be consistent
with the neighborhood range. Unfortunately, the Planning staff misread or
misinterpreted the ARB report, resulting in a flawed analysis, summary, and
recommendation being issued to the Planning Commission.
During the May 26 Planning Commission hearing, in view of the City Planning's rejection of advocating single story expansion, I requested that the owner reduce the size of the second story (by adding more first floor space towards the backyard as discussed before) and shift the second story further towards the north. The owner proposes a second story that sits closer to the neighbor on the south, with a 24'4" setback from the south neighbor versus a 24'11" setback from the north neighbor. Because of the following two reasons, it is reasonable to shift the second story towards the north by at least another 6 feet: 1) the existing property has a much larger front yard setback on the north side than on the south side (45'7" on the north corner VS. 34'10" on the south corner); and 2) the two story

house at 2011 HOD will be much taller than the house at 2001 HOD, but will be of
similar height as the house at 2017 HOD. This shift northward would have the
effect of grouping two similarly-sized masses, while minimizing the mismatch in size when juxtaposed with the smaller, single story structure at 2011 HOD. As stated in Resolution 7272, "the proposed height and bulk of structures should respect existing structures on neighboring properties and not overwhelm them with
disproportionate size and scale." I have pointed out that the foundation at 2011 HOD is at least 5 feet higher than the foundation at 2001 HOD, which is a single a story residence. Adding on a second story to 2011 HOD will overwhelm the
smaller existing neighboring property, so shifting it away will help to mitigate the
size and massing effect.
In addition, I had requested that the second story windows on the north and south sides be removed to mitigate privacy issues, as discussed earlier. I also asked that the roof pitch be lowered to 3:12, as recommended by the ARB and the Planning staff report. The owner stated that lowering the roof pitch would reduce the allowable attic headroom for HVAC servicing. However, one Planning Commissioner asked that the architect seek alternatives for placement of the HVAC for improved servicing. I share those sentiments and ask that the architect seek out solutions for HVAC placement that will allow for the reduction in roof pitch to 3:12. In consulting with an outside architect, I was shown easy solutions to the HVAC placement, leading me to believe that the owner's architect has perhaps intentionally made suboptimal effort at addressing this issue for reasons unclear.
Since the house has been expanded significantly, there iS no need for an attic storage room (about 100 SF) if floor plans are well thought out, nor is there any difficulty in housing HVAC somewhere else other than the attic. For example, the high ceiling, grand stairway can be modified to provide more storage space. Furthermore, on the second floor, there are two large closets next to a den of 502 SF-this den may in the future be easily divided into a fifth bedroom and a smaller den. Therefore, in order to lower the total height of this two story house and mitigate its negative impact on adjacent neighbors, it is reasonable to it reduce the roof pitch to 3:12 and eliminate the attic storage room.
also asked the Planning Commission to mandate a reduction in the second story plate height to 8'0", which would lower the overall height an additional 6", as the height of the first floor is 8'0" (see Architectural Plans) and, as stated in the Planning report and echoed by the ARB report, "the new second floor should match the height of the first floor". The second floor plate height of 8 feet is not unheard of, as it is part of the design of many single story homes and second story additions throughout the Arcadia Highlands, and as supported by the ARB Findings and Action Report, "existing second story plate heights (are) established within the immediate neighborhood of 8.5 feet or less."
In addition, I suggest keeping the existing recessed entryway and removing the proposed construction of a protruding front porch. The existing recessed entryway is much more modest and harmonious with the overall ranch style of the house.

The protruding front porch, however, will add bulkiness to the house, and it would not be compatible with the ranch style of the house.
In conclusion, I object to the two story proposed project as inappropriate for this location. In view of City Planning's unwillingness to support a single story remodel, must reiterate the modifications I also expressed at the May 26 hearing, which include reducing the size of the second story, shifting the second floor further north, removing north and south facing windows on the second floor to preserve privacy, along with reducing the second story plate to 8'0", reducing the roof pitch to 3:12, and removing the protruding front porch, will help to reduce the roof height, reduce massing, and decrease the impact upon the neighbors. Finally, I request soil studies and environmental quality impact analysis to address various vital considerations mandated by CEQA. These are essential elements to consider in preserving the quality and attractive character of
this unique neighborhood for the enjoyment of the community and future
generations.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
