Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint

F (collectively "Conservation Groups") hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate against defendant

2 and respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and by this Verified Petition for Writ of

3 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorney's Fees (*Verified

4 Petition") hereby allege as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

7 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC') section 21000 et seq., the Delta Reform Act ("DRA"),

8 Water Code section 85000, et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action to

9 challenge DWR's March 27, 2020, Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for

10 the Long Term Operation of the California State Water Project ('Project"), and Project approval. In

11 taking these actions DWR violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine.

12 2. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public agencies to

13 examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect
14 California's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency

15 actions.

16 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider
17 alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does neither.

18 4. The Project, as approved, is intended to allow DWR to operate the State Water Project

19 ("SWP") under an incidental take permit ("ITP") issued by the California Department of Fish and

20 Wildlife ("CDFW") pursuant to the Califomnia Endangered Species Act ("CESA"). Yet DWR failed to

21 present a stable project description, adequately examine the environmental impacts of the Project,

22 consult with impacted tribes, and comply with other applicable state laws intended to protect the
23 environment.

24 5. The Delta Reform Act requires agencies' covered actions to be consistent with the Delta

25 Stewardship Council's Delta Plan and with the coequal goals of the Delta Reform Act. Yet DWR failed
26 to make the required consistency findings before approving the Project.

27 6. The Public Trust Doctrine mandates that DWR consider public trust resources, including

28 fisheries, and act to protect those resources by all feasible means. Contrary to that mandate, DWR failed

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 2 -

4 1 to adequately consider and protect these resources in issuing the Project approvals.

2 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

3 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

4 ("CCP*) sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus);

5 PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California

6 Constitution.

7 8. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers),
395 (actions generally), and 401(1) (actions against state agency in any county where Attorney General
has office) because the Attorney General maintains an office in the City and County of San Francisco.
10 Conservation Groups were unable to file a verified petition and complaint in Sacramento, where DWR's

11 offices are located, as the Sacramento County Superior Court has declared a holiday due to the ongoing

12 public health pandemic and is not currently accepting case-initiating documents in cases arising under

13 CEQA.

14 9. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a

15 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely

16 served DWR with notice of this suit. Although not required by PRC section 21167.6.5, petitioners have

17 also named the Bureau of Reclamation (the "Bureau") as a real party in interest and are timely serving

18 this verified petition and complaint on the Bureau. The Bureau is neither a necessary party under Code

19 of Civil Procedure section 389(a) nor an indispensable party under Code of Civil Procedure section

20 389(b).

21 PARTIES

22 10. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit
23 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was

24 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of

25 excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and

26 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds

27 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North

28 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 3 -

1 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the

2 Project.

3 11. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ('IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt

4 organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the communities

5 that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR

6 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR

7 seeks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has
8 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection

9 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR
10 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.

11 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to

12 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.

13 12. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS
14 ("PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

15 San Francisco, California. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

16 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined
17 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial
18 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's
19 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific
20 salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

21 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing
22 livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta

23 and its associated ecosystems.

24 13. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
25 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats
26 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in

27 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento

28 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint

community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich

2 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco

3 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DWR's Project approval because it would threaten

4 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected

5 ecosystems.

6 14. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal

7 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The

8 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural

9 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of

10 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta"). The

11 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced

12 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other

13 environmental harms that implementation of the Project will allow.

14 15. Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

15 ("DWR") is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of

16 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on March 27,

17 2020, and approval of the Project, was subject to and violated the requirements of CEQA, the Delta

18 Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency under CEQA for environmental

19 review of the Project.

20 16. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to

21 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

22 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the

23 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in

24 part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

25 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe
26 respondents have been ascertained.

27 17. Real party in interest UNITED STATES BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ("Bureau") is a

28 federal agency that operates the CVP. The Bureau and DWR coordinate their operation of the CVP, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 5 -

thus the Bureau may receive a benefit from DWR's approval of the Project.

2 18. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to

3 PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any specific real parties in

4 interest exist. However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is

5 necessary, petitioners have identified the Bureau as a potential real party in interest. The true names and

6 capacities of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore

7 sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners are

8 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real

9 parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
10 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe real parties

11 in interest have been ascertained.

12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 19. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
14 their substantial beneficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.

15 20. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified

16 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

17 required by law.

18 21. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

19 the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

20 DWR's Certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project, and ordering it to comply with the laws

21 whose violation is alleged herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are

22 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other

23 legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the
24 environment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct.

25 22. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual

26 controversy exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

27 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitioners are

28 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 6 -

therefore necessary and appropriate.

2 23. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of

3 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project

4 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental

5 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to DWR's failure to take the required

6 steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et

7 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

8 LEGAL BACKGROUND

9 CEQA

10 24. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

11 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

12 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

13 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

14 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

15 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible
16 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)
17 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.

18 25. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

19 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

20 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. Mountain

21 Lion Foundation V. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; PRC §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D),

22 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects

23 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of

24 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

25 26. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary
26  projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is a "public agency" and a "state agency" as defined in CEQA. PRC §
27 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.

28 27. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint -7-

agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the
2 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and

3 Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory

4 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and recognized under Guidelines

5 sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the California

6 Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333

7 and 15354.

8 28. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that a

9 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those effects and
10 suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve

11 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant environmental effects. PRC §§
12 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.

13 29. CEQA requires the lead agency to provide a clear description of the Project under
14 consideration. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative

15 and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193;

16 Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929,

17 938; Washoe Meadows Community v. Department of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277,

18 287.

19 30. The EIR must include "[a] statement of the objectives sought by the proposed project. .

20 The statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project and may discuss the
21 project benefits." Guidelines § 15124(b). "[A] lead agency may not give a project's purpose an

22 artificially narrow definition." North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647,

23 668 (quoting In re Bay-Delta (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1166). The agency's formulation of its underlying

24 purpose and objectives is essential to its consideration of alternatives. Id. An agency need not study
25 alternatives that cannot satisfy the Project's basic goal. Id.

26 31. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid
27 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA's

28 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 8 -

1 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only

2 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.

3 32. In order to comply with CEQA "an EIR must be performed before a project is approved, for

4 "if postapproval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing more than post

5 hoc rationalizations to support action already taken." Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45

6 Cal.4th 116, 130, bracket omitted, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of

7 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 276, 394).

8 33. For every CEQA project that had "a notice of preparation or a notice of negative declaration

9 or mitigated negative declaration filed on or after July 1, 2015" - such as this Project - the lead agency is

10 required to consult with California Indian Tribes. Stats. 2014, ch. 532 (A.B. 52), § 11(c), eff. Jan 1,

11 2015); PRC § 21080.3.1. For the purposes of CEQA, section 21080.3.1(b) incorporates the definition of
12 "consultation" found in Government Code section 65352.4. Thus, DWR was required to undertake

13 [a] meaningful and timely process of seeking, discussing, and considering carefully the. views of others, in a manner that is cognizant of all parties' cultural values and, where
14 feasible, seeking agreement. Consultation between government agencies and Native American tribes shall be conducted in way that is mutually respectful of each party's 15 sovereignty. Consultation shall also recognize the tribes' potential needs for

16 confidentiality with respect to places that have traditional tribal cultural significance.

17 Government Code § 65352.4, emphasis added.

18 34. Consultation is complete either when parties "agree to measures to avoid or mitigate a

19 significant effect on a tribal cultural resource" or "a party, acting in good faith and after reasonable

20 effort, concludes that mutual agreement cannot be reached." PRC § 21080.3.2.(b)(1)-(2), emphasis

21 added.

22
The Delta Reform Act
23
35. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature
24

25 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and
California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water
26
. is a critically important
27 Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that "the Delta'
natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the
28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint

1 California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North

2 and South America." Water Code § 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization

3 of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added.

4 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,

5 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water

6 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state

7 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.

8 36. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta

9 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight
10 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

11 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state over the long term. 12
(b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the 13 California Delta as an evolving place.

14 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a

15 healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.

16 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water
use.

17 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with

18 achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.
(f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage. 19

20 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.

21 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility,

22 accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.

23 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

24 37. The Legislature also declared that:

25 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in
26 improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for
27 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water

28 technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 10 -

- Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

2 The Public Trust Doctrine

3

4 38. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
5 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

6 39.

7 In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted

8 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
they

9 consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,

10 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
Court went on to explain:

12 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative

13 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state

14 may have to approve approptiations despite foresecable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the

15 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

18 40. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

19 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

20 general recreation purposes the navigable waters.of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

21 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

22 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the

23 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

24 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and
which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

26 41. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

27 the public trust doctrine . . . . [;] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy
the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever
28 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. V. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A]

1 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

2 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at 570.

3 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

4 42. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and

5 international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest

6 and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in

7 peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of

8 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." Id.

9 43. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
10 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for

11 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California (or "State") Water Project ("SWP").

12 Second, for too long, agricultural diverters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off

13 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are

14 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,

15 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

16 44. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

17 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant

18 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in

19 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run

20 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been

21 driven perilously close to extirpation.

22 45. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered

23 Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population declines,
24 declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its
25 tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared
26 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

27 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat

28 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint . 12 -

1 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical

2 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fed.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58

3 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

4 46. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and diversions

5 that would have destroyed the free-flowing rivers of California's North Coast and removed additional

6 essential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steelhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was

7 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre feet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,
8 DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all

9 but the wettest of water years.

10 47. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water

11 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that

12 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas

13 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils

14 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and

15 sodium chlorides and sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries

16 threatens the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

17 48. On December 12, 2018, DWR approved the Coordinated Operations Agreement Addendum

18 ("COA Addendum"), which modified DWR's operation of the SWP in coordination with the Bureau of
19 Reclamation. Yet DWR failed to conduct any environmental review of that action.

20 49. On or about April 19, 2019, DWR issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project,

21 notifying the public that it would act as the lead agency for the preparation of an EIR for the Project.

22 That Notice of Preparation did not include a clear description of the Project DWR proposed to undertake.

23 While the NOP indicates that the EIR is intended to facilitate the issuance of an ITP by CDFW for

24 DWR's operations of the SWP, it failed to provide a particularized description of a project under

25 consideration. Instead, the NOP informed the public merely that DWR will continue to operate the SWP

26 "to provide flood control and water supply for agricultural, municipal, industrial, recreational, and

27 environmental purposes consistent with applicable legal requirements." April 19, 2019 Notice of
28 Preparation, p. 3.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint 13 -

1 50. In its Notice of Preparation for this Project, DWR included a commitment to study the

2 impacts of the COA Addendum in the Project's EIR in order to provide the public "with transparent

3 analysis of the environmental effects." NOP 4.

4 51. Conservation Groups submitted detailed comments dated May 28, 2019, informing DWR of

5 its need to comply with CEQA, the Public Trust Doctrine, and the Delta Reform Act.

6 52. On or about November 22, 2019, DWR issued its Draft Environmental Impact Report
7 (DEIR") for the Project. The DEIR included a No Project Alternative, as well as a Proposed Project,

8 and Alternatives 2a, 2b, 3, 4 and 5 to the Proposed Project.

9 53. On or about January 6, 2020, Conservation Groups submitted additional detailed comments

10 addressing shortcomings in the DEIR and related yiolations of CEQA, and reminding DWR of its need

11 to comply with the Delta Reform Act and Public Trust Doctrine.

12 54. Onor about March 27, 2020, DWR certified the FEIR and approved the Refined Alternative

13 2B, a Project Alternative developed after DWR's circulation of the DEIR. DWR's Notice of
14 Determination was received by the State CEQA Clearinghouse maintained by the Governor's Office of

15 Planning and Research on March 30, 2020. In approving the Project, DWR incorrectly determined that
16 the Project would have no significant impacts.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (Violation of CEQA)
19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20

21 55. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

reference.
22 56. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, on
23

24 the grounds that DWR committed prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner

25 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.
DWR Failed to Utilize: a Stable Project Description as CEQA Requires
26

27 57. CEQA requires DWR to provide a clear description of the Project under consideration. "An
accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient

1 EIR." County of Inyo, 71 Cal.App.3d at 193; Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc., 42 Cal.3d at 938;

2 Washoe Meadows Community, 17 Cal.App.5th at 287. Yet DWR failed to do so.

3 58. Instead, the DEIR states:

4 The Proposed Project, which is the preferred alternative in this [DEIR], consists of multiple elements that characterize future operations of SWP facilities, modify ongoing programs being implemented as part of SWP operations, improve specific activities that

6 would enhance protection of special-status fish species, or support ongoing studies and research on these special-status species to improve the basis of knowledge and

7 management of these species. Implementation of these elements is intended to continue operation of the SWP and deliver up to the full contracted water amounts while minimizing and fully mitigating the take of listed species consistent with CESA
8 requirements.

Q DEIR 3-15; see also FEIR II.3-16. The DEIR includes brief descriptions of various elements of the

10 Proposed Project. DEIR 3-15 to 3-17; FEIR III.3-16 to II.3-19. Yet this discussion lacks sufficient

11 clarity and detail to inform the reader regarding what DWR proposed to do. Id. The alternatives to the

12 Proposed Project were described in similarly vague and obfuscatory ways. FEIR MI.5-1.

13 59. Only after circulating the DEIR did DWR provide a description of what the Proposed

14 Project was intended to accomplish. FEIR HI.3-16. DWR's changes to the description of the Proposed

15 Project include a belated disclosure of its planned duration. Id. By failing to provide a stable and finite
16 description of the Project, DWR violated CEQA.

17 60. The Project, as approved, is not described in the DEIR. DWR developed Refined

18 Alternative 2B after it circulated the DEIR. FEIR I-1. Thus, the FEIR includes entirely new analysis

19 and discussion that was not provided to the public for review and comment before approval. FEIR III.5-

20 38 to MI.5-285. DWR's description of the Project was not sufficient to inform the public of the Project

21 that it approved.

22 DWR Failed to Provide a Clear Discussion of the Project's Purpose and Objectives

23 61. CEQA requires that the EIR include "[a] statement of the objectives sought by the proposed

24 project. . . . The statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project and may

25 discuss the project benefits." Guidelines § 15124(b). "[A] lead agency may not give a project's
26 purpose an artificially narrow definition.' North Coast Rivers Alliance, 243 Cal.App.4th at 668.

27 62. Here, DWR did not provide a statement regarding the underlying purpose of the Project

28 until it published its Final EIR the same day it approved the Project. FEIR II.6.5-16. In its NOP and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint • 15 -

DEIR, DWR stated that:

2 The objective of the Proposed Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP

3 consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water in accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full contract quantities.
4 DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific information.
5
NOP DEIR 3-1. It was only after DWR circulated the DEIR for public comment that it created a
6

7 statement of the underlying purpose of the Project:
The underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain incidental take authorization
8 from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the California

9 Endangered Species Act to allow DWR to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements.

10

11 FEIR II.6.5-15. Thus, DWR failed to provide the public with a clear explanation of what DWR intended

12 the Project to do, and why. But by delaying the formulation of the statement of underlying purpose until

13 the conclusion of the environmental review process, DWR improperly curtailed informed public

14 participation. Without a clear statement of the underlying goal of the Project, DWR frustrated the

15 formulation and discussion of reasonable alternatives to the Project, and the public's ability to weigh in

16 regarding the same.
DWR Failed to Comply With CEQA's Consultation Requirements
17

18 63. For every CEQA project that had "a notice of preparation or a notice of negative declaration

19 or mitigated negative declaration filed on or after July 1, 2015" - such as this Project - the lead agency is

20 required to consult with California Indian Tribes. Stats. 2014, ch. 532 (A.B. 52), § 11(c), eff. Jan 1,

21 2015); PRC § 21080.3.1. For the purposes of CEQA, PRC section 21080.3.1(b) incorporates the

22 definition of "consultation" found in Government Code section 65352.4. Thus, DWR was required to

undertake
23

24 [a] meaningful and timely process of seeking, discussing, and considering carefully the

25 views of others, in a manner that is cognizant of all parties' cultural values and, where feasible, seeking agreement. Consultation between government agencies and Native

26 American tribes shall be conducted in way that is mutually respectful of each party's sovereignty. Consultation shall also recognize the tribes potential needs for

27 confidentiality with respect to places that have traditional tribal cultural significance.

28 Government Code § 65352.4, emphasis added.

/
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint • 16 -

1 64. Consultation is complete either when parties "agree to measures to avoid or mitigate a
2 significant effect on a tribal cultural resource" or "a party, acting in good faith and after reasonable

3 effort, concludes that mutual agreement cannot be reached." PRC § 21080.3.2.(b)(1)-(2), emphasis

4 added. To determine whether a project has an impact on a tribal a cultural resource, DWR is required to

5 consider the significance of the resource to the Winnemem Wintu Tribe. PRC § 21074.
65. DWR failed to consult with the Winnemem Wintu Tribe before preparing and circulating

7 the DEIR, despite Conservation Group's May 28, 2019 comment letter informing DWR of its duty to do

8 so. DWR made nO effort to cure this defect in response to Conservation Group's January 7, 2020
comment letter on the DEIR, which highlighted this ongoing deficiency. Instead, DWR asserts that it

10 had neither a duty to consult with the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, nor a duty to respond to a request for

11 consultation from the Winnemem Wintu Tribe. Indeed, DWR improperly ignored and misconstrued the
12 Winnemem Wintu Tribe's scoping comments. The FEIR states that while "at the Delta Conveyance

13. Informational Meeting for The California Tribal Community in Lincoln, California, DWR's Tribal

14 Policy Advisor reminded the Winnemum [sic] Wintu representative that DWR had not yet received a

15 request for consultations per the Public Resources Code" - despite having received the Tribe's scoping
16 comments which included a request for consultation. Thus, whether or not a supposed "Tribal
17 Representative" purportedly "agreed that such a letter had yet to be submitted," during a purported

18 conversation with DWR without counsel present, DWR had a clear duty to act upon the written request it

19 had received in the Winnemem Wintu Tribe's formal scoping comments.

20 66. By proceeding with the Project without undertaking the necessary consultation, DWR failed

21 to consider the Winnemem Wintu Tribe's expertise and evidence in identifying, evaluating and

22 discussing the Project's potential impacts on the Tribe's cultural resources.

23 The FEIR Fails to Appropriately Address the Coordinate Operations Agreement Amendment
24

25 67. Despite its commitment in its NOP that the EIR would evaluate the impacts associated with

26 the COA Addendum, DWR failed to provide an adequate and transparent analysis of the COA

27 Addendum in the FEIR. Instead, DWR incorporated the COA Addendum's changes to SWP operations
28 into the environmental baseline for the Project. And while DWR presents modeling that compares the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 17 -

COA Addendum and the 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreement, it does not address how the Project's

2 impacts would differ with (or without) the COA Addendum. Further, DWR's hyperlink to complete
CalSim II model output for the 2018 COA Addendum and 1986 COA Studies did not provide the public

4 with the promised information.

5 68. DWR's failure to provide accurate and transparent analysis of the COA Addendum fails to

6 foster informed decisionmaking and public participation, contrary to CEQA's informational mandates.

7 The FEIR Fails to Disclose and Analyze the Project's Impacts

8 69. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a

9 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential

10 alternatives to the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter

11 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
12 potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).

13 70. The FEIR fails to disclose the impacts of the Project in several ways. First, DWR
14 improperly limited the Project area to include only "the SWP Service Areas and Existing SWP storage

15 and export facilities located within the Delta and vicinity." FEIR HII.3-1. DWR included only the areas
16 receiving Project benefits, and excluded areas the Project would harm. Equally improper, it excluded the
17 related CVP facilities from the Project Area, as well as DWR facilities upstream of the Delta. FEIR

18 II.1-4, III.3-1. Thus, despite the interrelated nature of their SWP and CVP operations, and the manner in

19 which each water project alters the conditions for the other, the DWR.'s Project Area excludes
20 watersheds and water facilities that will face changed environmental conditions due to DWR's Project

21 operation. In so doing, DWR avoided disclosing potentially significant impacts that would occur due to

22 the Project's implementation, including impacts surrounding the operation of Oroville Reservoir and the

23 Trinity River System, and all CVP water sources that would be primarily under the control of the Bureau
24 including the Trinity, Sacramento and American rivers. This failure led DWR to omit discussions of the

25 impacts to fisheries resources upstream of the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers,
26 including in the Trinity River, even when the Project may impact flow and temperature in these
27 waterways. This violates CEQA. Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2013) 108

28 Cal.App.4th 859, 870-872 (impacts on interconnected waterways must be examined in EIR).

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint . 18 -

71. DWR's FEIR disclaims any need to study impacts caused by its Project upstream of the

2 confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers because, it argues, DWR has limited ability to take

3 action to mitigate those effects. But this does not excuse DWR's failure to disclose these impacts.

4 CEQA required DWR to do so. Were DWR to have determined that appropriate mitigation measures

5 exist but are outside its jurisdiction to mandate, it was required to make findings that indicate that "those

6 changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have

7 been, or can and should be, adopted by that other agency." PRC § 21081(a)(2).. DWR was not

8 authorized to ignore potentially feasible mitigation measures for significant impacts simply because

9 other agencies may be required to implement them. Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa

10 Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304-1305; City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of California

11 State University (2015) 61 Cal.4th 945, 957.

12 72. The FEIR improperly concludes that the Project will not have water quality impacts from

13 proposed fall pulse flows of agricultural drain water. FEIR 11.6.5-19 to 11.6.5-20. DWR instead claims

14 that the timing of these flows will prevent the introduction of pollutants, or that the use of these flows

15 will be "adaptively managed" to avoid water quality impacts. Id. Neither position is based on science,

16 let alone actual empirical evidence. "An EIR must focus on impacts to the existing environment, not

17 hypothetical situations." County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th

18 931, 955. The Project's fall pulse flows of agricultural drain water would be composed of available

19 drainage water from rice fields discharged at the end of the growing season. FEIR III.3-32 to IIL.3-33,

20 II.5-57 to III.5-58 (use of fall pulse flows under Refined Alternative 2B). The FEIR concedes that

21 "mercury methylation can occur when lands are flooded, such as for rice production." FEIR 11.6.5.-

22 19. Yet the FEIR inexplicably - and falsely - claims that the use of water that will be drained from rice

23 fields would not introduce additional contaminants. Id. DWR's discussion and analysis of this impact

24 fails to foster informed decsionmaking.

25 73. As part of the Project, DWR proposes "using agricultural drain water from Colusa Drain

26 over a 4-week period [in the fall to] improve downstream transport of phytoplankton." FEIR III.5-

27 58. But DWR never appropriately studied whether this drain water would be contaminated with
28 pesticides and other chemicals commonly used in the rice fields drained by the Colusa Drain, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 19 -

r whether using this water as proposed would have resultant impacts on water quality and fisheries.

2 74. DWR's FEIR also fails to discuss and disclose the potential impacts of the Project's
pesticide use. The Project includes applications of Aquathol K and copper-based herbicides. Yet DWR

4 fails to disclose the significant risks of harm to fish posed by copper-based products, let alone discuss

5 whether these risks are mitigated adequately. Instead, DWR relies solely upon herbicide application
6 procedures and water quality sampling to claim that the Project will not have significant impacts.

7 75. By improperly conflating its discussion of the Project's impacts with its discussion of

8 measures designed to minimize those impacts, DWR has prevented the public from understanding the

9 scope and severity of those impacts and subsequently, the efficacy of the mitigation measures that the
10 DWR improperly presumed would reduce those impacts to insignificance. The distinction is not one of

11 semantics, but instead of purpose and effect. Lotus v. Dep't of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th

12 645, 655-656, 656 n. 8 (discussing the distinction between measures that are part of the project, such as

13 paving mixes, from measures that are "plainly mitigation measures," such as restorative planting).
76. The FEIR improperly concludes that the Project will not harm chinook or cobo salmon. Yet 14

15 the Project will harm both. First, by altering the operation of the SWP, the Project will result in changes

16 to the Bureau's operation of the CVP, including the Trinity River flows which otherwise flow through

17 the Klamath River and are available for coho salmon in that system. Second, the FEIR discloses that in

18 wet, above normal, and below normal water year types, Refined Alternative 2B is modeled to have

19 higher loss of juvenile Spring Run Chinook salmon when compared to existing conditions. FEIR III.5-

20 177. In wet water years, this loss is projected to be 56% higher. Id. This increase in loss correlates with

21 Refined Alternative 2B's increase in south-of-delta exports in wetter conditions. FEIR HII.5-179.

22 77. The FEIR likewise assumes - contrary to a long history of Endangered Species Act

23 violations - that DWR and the Bureau will continue to comply with the requirements of the 2009

24 Biological Opinion for the Coordinated Operation of the SWP and CVP, skewing its analysis to obscure

25 and understate Project impacts on fish and wildlife.

26 DWR Failed Include an Adequate Discussion of Alternatives

27 78. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even

28 if they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint •20 -

1 Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

2 79. CBQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow
3 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

4 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible
alternatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project

6 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.

7 Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).

8 80. The FEIR's presentation of the Project's alternatives fails to foster informed

9 decisionmaking. In addressing the Project and the alternatives thereto, DWR failed to detail how each
10 alternative compares to the Proposed Project. For example, the No Project Alternative discussion simply

11 states that it does not include the Proposed Project's actions, and refers the reader to the DEIR's

12 discussion of the existing environmental conditions. FEIR III. 5-1 to 5-5. Only in updating the analysis

13 to include Refined Alternative 2B did DWR provide any level of detailed analysis that might allow the

14 public to contrast the options under consideration. FEIR III. 5-38 to III.5-285. And this information was

15 only made available to the public after DWR approved the Project. The discussion of the other
16 alternatives provides some additional information, but continues to obfuscate the differences between the

17 various alternatives. FEIR III.5-6 to III.5-38 (discussing Alternative 2.A), III.5-286 to III.5-329
18 (discussing Alternatives 3 and 4). For example, the FEIR's discussion of Alternative 4 indicates that it

19 would replace summer and fall actions of the Proposed Project to add additional Delta Smelt habitat

20 criteria. FEIR 1II.5-301. The FEIR indicates that this change may require "additional outflow" which

21 would be provided through "some combination of' (1) "SWP and CVP export reductions," (2) increased

22 releases from Oroville Reservoir, or (3) "[w]ater purchases from other water users." FEIR III.5-301 to

23 III.5.302. But, as with its discussion of the Proposed Project, the FEIR fails to examine the impacts of

24 these changes throughout the impacted watershed. And, because DWR excluded Oroville Reservoir and

25 the Feather River from its analysis, the FEIR lacks the information necessary to understand the impacts

26 of Alternative 4 as compared to the No Project Alternative or the Proposed Project. FEIR III. 5-316

27 (discussing impacts upstream of the Delta for Alternative 4).

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 21 -

DWR Fails to Discuss Inconsistencies Between the Project and the Applicable Delta Plan

2 81. CEQA requires that the EIR "discuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and
applicable .. . regional plans" such as the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan. Guidelines
4 15125(d). Despite this requirement, DWR failed to include such a discussion in the FEIR, on the

5 mistaken premise that the Delta Plan does not apply to the Project. DWR's failure to include this

6 analysis violates CEQA.

7 DWR Should Have Recirculated the DEIR

8 82. Guidelines section 15088.5(a) requires agencies "to recirculate an EIR when significant new

9 information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR ... but

10 before certification." New information is deemed "significant" where "the EIR is changed in a way that

11 deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon [1] a substantial adverse
12 environmental effect of the project or [2] a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect ... that the

13 project's proponents have declined to implement." Id.

14 83. Here, as discussed above, DWR made substantial changes to the EIR after circulating the

15 DEIR. The FEIR includes 247 new pages of analysis of the impacts of Refined Alterative 2B alone.

16 FEIR III.5-38 to FEIR III.5-285. The significant addition of this Project Alternative in the FEIR
17 precluded public comment on the Project that DWR approved, including the ability to comment on the

18 additional impacts that Refined Alternative 2B may have on the environment.

19 84. Likewise DWR's significant alteration of the Project's fundamental purpose in the FEIR
20 precluded public participation and requires recirculation.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

23 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

24 85. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

25 reference.

26 86. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., was passed by the Legislature in
27 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water
28 infrastructure are in crisis" and that "fr]esolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint •22 -

state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was

2 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provide
for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the

4 Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a

5 legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code 8 85001(c).

6 87. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered

7 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

8 is action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship

9 Council. Water Code § 85225.

10 88. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined

11 by PRC section 21065 that:

12 within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh. (1) Will occur, in whole or in part,

13 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency.

14 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

15 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

16 goats or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

17 Water Code 85057.5(a). The Project meets these criteria, and is therefore a covered action. While the

18 Delta Reform Act states that "frJoutine maintenance and operation of the State. Water Project" is not a

19 covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption because it is neither routine maintenance

20 nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).

21 89. The 2013 Delta Plan prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set

22 aside by the Sacramento Superior Court because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reform

23 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated
24 with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring

25 more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with the Delta Reform Act."

26 Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. To address

27 these Delta Plan deficiencies, the Delta Stewardship Council amended the Delta Plan in 2018.

28 Petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's 2018 Delta Plan

3 other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacramento Superior Court Case Nos.
34-2018-80002898, 34-2018-80002900, 34-2018-80002901, 34-2018-80002904.

4

5 90. DWR denies that the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act. FEIR I.17-6.
But Water Code section 85057.5(b)'s exemption of "fr]outine maintenance and operation of the State
6 Water Project" from the definition of covered action cannot apply to this Project, which encompasses

7

8 changes to the operation of the SWP to comply with CDFW's ITP requirements. Such changes are
that simple "routine operation." more

9 91. Because the Project is a covered action under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve
10 the Project without first making a determination of consistency with the Delta Plan. Water Code §

11

12 85225. And because approval of the Project continues DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without

13 any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the Delta Reform Act's coequial goals, the Project is

14 inherently inconsistent with what would be required by any valid Delta Plan.

15 92. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings

16 as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,
its approval must be set aside. Water Code § 85225.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18

19 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)

20 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

21 93. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

reference.

22

23 94. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
24 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

25 95. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
26 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions

27 they

28 consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
so far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint

1 Court went on to explain:

2 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative
3 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

4 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the
5 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the

6 uses protected by the trust.
Id., citations omitted.
7

8 96. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

9 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

10 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

11 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks, 6 Cal.3d at 259. For nearly 50 years it has

12 been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] .. . the preservation of those

13 lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific study, as open space,

14 and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect
the scenery and climate of the area." Id. at 259-260.
15

16 97. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

17 the public trust doctrine .... [,] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

18 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

19 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571. "[A] public trust use is not any use that

20 may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public access, public enjoyment, or public

21 use of trust land." Id. at 570. Agencies tasked with protecting public trust resources have affirmative

22 statutory and constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

23 feasible," based on a fair and a fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on public trust

24 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.
98. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and
25

26 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation, and do so for non-public trust purposes - the

27 diversion of Delta water for consumptive use. Despite public comment regarding the Project's impacts

28 to public trust resources, and the need to protect those resources from harm by non-public trust uses such

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 25 -

1 as the Project's diversion of Delta water for consumptive uses, DWR argues that its CEQA analysis is all

2 that was necessary to address or examine the issue in its FEIR. Yet DWR's public trust duties require
DWR to examine whether its activities will protect public trust uses independently of any analysis

4 required by CEQA, and to protect those public trust uses from harm from non-public trust uses.

5 99. By approving the Project without appropriate consideration of whether additional feasible

6 alternatives could benefit public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, and without

7 adequately protecting public trust resources and uses from non-public trust uses, DWR abdicated its

8 affirmative statutory and constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses

9 whenever feasible," based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on

10 public trust resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

13 Project Approvals as Contrary to CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

14 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

15 100. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

16 reference.

17 101. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to
18 approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085

19 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:

.20 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law;

21 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

22 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

23 before DWR.

24 102. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects, among

25 others:

26 a, DWR violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

27 b. DWR violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged hereinabove; and

28 C. DWR violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged hereinabove.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint • 26 -

1 103. DWR's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures required by

2 CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded DWR's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of

3 discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

5 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:

6 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR from taking any action to
catry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

8 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to set aside and vacate its approval of the

9 Project, and certification of its FEIR;

10 3. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful;

11 4. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all activity implementing the

12 Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it has taken all

13 actions necessary to bring its approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA, the Delta

14 Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and the Code of Civil Procedure;

15 5. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

16 6. For costs incurred in this action; and

17 7. For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
