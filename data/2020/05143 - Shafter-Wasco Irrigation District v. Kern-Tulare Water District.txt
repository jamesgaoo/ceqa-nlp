1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner SHAFTER-WASCO IRRIGATION DISTRICT (*Petitioner" or

3 "SWID") brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus ("Petition") against Respondent KERN-

4 TULARE WATER DISTRICT ("Respondent" or "KTWD") to remedy KTWD's failure to

5 properly evaluate the potentially significant environmental impacts of renewing two water service

6 contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") and the California Department of

7 Water Resources ("DWR"): Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8601A-IR18 and Interim

8 Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8367A-IR18 (collectively, the "Project" or the "Renewal

9 Contracts"), in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
LLP XOANHOS AHAAVA LIVAH NIALSNMONA 10 section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").

11 2. The Renewal Contracts provide that KTWD may via Reclamation obtain and
[ILZ-10LE6 VO Barbara eJues 1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor 12 transport water from the Central Valley Project ("CVP") San Luis Unit and Delta Division

13 through the Cross Valley Canal, which connects the California Aqueduct to the Friant-Kern

14 Canal, as shown on the map on the following page.

15 3. The Friant-Kern Canal provides a major water delivery system to water users

16 throughout California's Central Valley. Water in the Friant-Kern Canal is high quality,

17 originating in the Sierra Mountains before flowing south to Millerton Lake, a reservoir on the San

18 Joaquin River. In contrast, water delivered through the Cross Valley Canal is generally

19 significantly higher in salts and other constituents, such as chlorides and boron. KTWD's service

20 area and intake facilities are located north of SWID's, along the Friant-Kern Canal. In the past,

21 the Shafter Check (a major water pump used to lift water up elevations) has been used to create a

22 "reverse" flow on the Friant-Kern Canal, conveying poorer quality Cross Valley Canal water in a

23 northerly direction, past SWID's intake facilities.

24 4. Accordingly, the Cross Valley Canal deliveries expressly authorized by the

25 Renewal Contracts will degrade the quality of water in the Friant-Kern Canal that flows past

26 SWID's intake facilities, resulting in numerous significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

25 5. Despite the potentially significant environmental impacts of Cross Valley Canal

26 deliveries to the Friant-Kern Canal, KTWD erroneously determined that the Renewal Contracts

27 were categorically exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines section 15301 because the

28 Renewal Contracts involved the delivery of water through existing facilities. KTWD also

3

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 erroneously relied upon the statutory exemption for certain rate-setting activities pursuant to

2 CEQA Guidelines section 15273. Moreover, KTWD approved the Renewal Contracts without

3 offering the public or affected stakeholders an opportunity to understand the basis for the claimed

4 CEQA exemptions. KTWD even violated the Brown Act by refusing to provide SWID with a

5 copy of the meeting packet prior to KTWD's approval of the Renewal Contracts and the

6 associated Notices of Exemption ("NOEs").

7 6. Accordingly, SWID respectfully seeks writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

8 Procedure section 1085 (and in the alternative, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5) requiring

9 KTWD to rescind, void, and vacate any and all motions and resolutions reflecting its approval of
dTT'MOAHHOS HHHHVI LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10 the Project. These motions and resolutions include KTWD Resolution 2020-03: Authorizing

11 Execution of Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8601A-IR18 and KTWD Resolution
3101-2711 J001d puz goans edrseuy 12 2020-04: Authorizing Execution of Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8367A-IR18.

13 7. SWID also prays for appropriate injunctive relief and a stay to prevent KTWD Santa Barbara, 14 from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this

15 litigation and prior to complying with CEQA.

16 PARTIES

17 8. Petitioner SWID is a California irrigation district organized and existing under and

18 pursuant to California's Irrigation District Law (Wat. Code, §§ 20500 et seq.). SWID's service

19 area includes approximately 38,766 acres, located in the southern area of the San Joaquin Valley

20 generally in the northwest quadrant of Kern County. SWID's service area includes the

21 incorporated cities of Wasco and Shafter. Petitioner is authorized pursuant to Water Code section

22 22650 to commence and maintain any action and proceeding to carry out its purposes or protect

23 its interests. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself and on behalf of the landowners and

24 water users within its boundaries.

25 9. Respondent KTWD is a California water district organized and existing under

26 California Water District Law (Wat. Code, $§34000 et seq.).

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 10. SWID is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents ROES

2 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by fictitious names. SWID will amend

3 this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when the same has been ascertained.

4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 11. The Kern County Superior Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein

6 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

7 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

8 12. Venue is appropriate in Kern County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

9 393, 394 and 395 because Respondent is located within the County of Kern. Among other things,
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 Respondent's Project threatens prime agricultural farmland, landowners, water users, natural

11
: Floor resources, a common and interconnected groundwater basin, and the environment, all located 11LZ-IO1 6 VD '98q/8 vuS 12 within the County of Kern.

13 STANDING
Edeosuy 14 13. SWID has a direct and substantial beneficial interest pursuant to Code of Civil

15 Procedure section 1086 in KTWD's full and complete compliance with CEQA, and all other

16 applicable laws, in approving the Renewal Contracts.

17 14. SWID was formed in 1937 to identify ways to address the area's rapidly dwindling

18 groundwater supplies, and has continuously maintained public facilities for the diversion and

19 delivery of water to customers within its service area, primarily irrigation for agriculture.

20 15. In 1955, SWID entered into its first 40-year contract with Reclamation, and in
21 2010 a permanent contract was entered into. The water service contract with Reclamation is for

22 water from the CVP's Friant Division; SWID currently holds an entitlement for 50,000 acre-feet

23 per year ("AFY") of Class I water and 39,600 AFY Class II water. SWID generally takes

24 delivery of its CVP entitlement through its intake facilities on the Friant-Kern Canal. Under

25 SWID's Friant Division CVP contract, Reclamation is not responsible for the quality of water

26 delivered to SWID. SWID therefore monitors other agency actions and operations that may

27 impact the quality of water in the Friant-Kern Canal, and advocates for the monitoring and

28 maintenance of high water quality in a variety of forums, including this litigation.

5
AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 16. As noted above, KTWD's service area and intake facilities are located north of

2 SWID's, along the Friant-Kern Canal. Accordingly, SWID has a direct a and substantial interest in

3 KTWD's approval of the Renewal Contracts because the Renewal Contracts allow KTWD to take

4 delivery of lower-quality water originating in the Delta via the Cross Valley Canal. One means of

5 KTWD taking delivery of its CVP supply under the Renewal Contracts is for water to be pumped

6 a in a northerly or "reverse" direction up the Friant-Kern Canal, past SWID's intake facilities. This

7 jeopardizes the quality of SWID's otherwise high-quality supply from Lake Millerton by

8 introducing lower quality water originating in the Delta.

9 17. Maintaining the high quality of the water flowing past SWID's Friant-Kern Canal
JTT'NOINHOS MIAMVA LIVAH NIMISNMOXA 10 intake facilities is paramount. Within SWID's service area of approximately 38,766 acres, there
11 are approximately 21,600 acres of almond trees. Many of these trees are of a specific rootstock Floor ITZZ-101£6 VO ARQIEE 12 that is both particularly high-yield and especially sensitive to the quality of applied water,
1021 Anacapa Street,: 13 particularly salts. SWID's landowner-customers have relied on the higher quality Millerton
14 Lake/Friant-Kern Canal source as an expected component of their agricultural operations. Planting
15 certain crops and irrigation scheduling coordination with deep wells was done with the expectation

16 of the high-quality water being available. Unlike other water districts, SWID does not routinely
17 add groundwater to its supplies to fill out deliveries. Instead, SWID landowners run their own on-
18 site deep wells. However, not all SWID customers have wells, and some are therefore entirely
19 dependent on SWID's delivery of CVP water. Moreover, SWID has a beneficial interest in the
20 quality of groundwater supplies by virtue of its longstanding investments in and reliance upon

21 groundwater banking, recharge and exchanges as a component of its water supply portfolio.

22 18. Both Petitioner and Respondent have water delivery facilities to take water from
23 the Friant-Kern Canal for use within their service areas, but only Respondent has allocations of

24 CVP water from both the San Luis Unit/ Delta Division and the Friant Division. Respondent also

25 purchases other supplemental water supplies when available. Petitioner's only CVP allocation is

26 from the Friant Division. SWID a has a clear, present, and beneficial right to ensure KTWD

27 undertakes legally required environmental review of the Renewal Contracts.

28 111

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 19. Even if SWID was not "beneficially interested" pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1086 (which it indisputably is), SWID would have standing to bring this suit
3 because. "the question is one of public right and the object of the mandamus is to procure the 2

4 enforcement of a public duty." (See Save the Plastic Bag Coalition V. City of Manhattan Beach

6 Cal.2d 98, 100.) This concept is sometimes referred to as "public interest standing" or the "public 5 (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 166, quoting Board of Social Welfare v. Los Angeles County (1945) 27

7right/public duty exception." The object of this mandamus action is to enforce the public's right to
8 ensure that KTWD analyzes the environmental impacts of its discretionary action in approving the

9 Renewal Contracts. KTWD owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal
JTI'IOANHOS MHAMVA LIVAH NIZISNMOHL 10 authority under CEQA and all other applicable laws before exercising its discretion to approve the
11 Renewal Contracts and file the NOEs. As a public agency water supplier, SWID's interest is in NILZ-101E6 VD BARqUEg eluRS :00ld puz 413a4S edeseuy 1021 12 ensuring water quality in the Friant-Kern Canal and groundwater supplies. These are not in the
13 narrow category of business-related competitive interests that could even conceivably defeat
14 SWID's ability to bring suit under the public right/public duty exception to the "beneficial

SWID has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of 15 interest" requirement.

16 20.

17 law, and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested herein. SWID,

18 and its landowners and water users, use surface water and groundwater existing in a common and

19 interconnected groundwater basin located north of Kern River for reasonable and beneficial use

20 of irrigation, and other purposes. KTWD's approval of the Renewal Contracts harms SWID, and

21 its landowners and water users, by threatening impairment of their reasonable and beneficial use

22 of the common and interconnected groundwater resources.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 23

24 21. SWID has repeatedly raised its concerns to KTWD regarding the water quality

25 impacts of introducing Cross Valley Canal water into the Friant-Kern Canal. SWID has

26 attempted repeatedly to engage a KTWD in a discussion about mitigation and monitoring to

27 ameliorate the water quality impacts of Cross Valley Canal water. SWID has also sought, in

28 multiple forums, to obtain more information about use of the Shafter Check to pump Cross Valley

7
AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 Canal water past SWID's intake facilities. KTWD has been placed on ample notice of the

2 environmental concerns that SWID now again raises in this litigation.

22. Attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by reference are true and correct 3

4 copies of various emails sent by SWID's General Manager, Dana Munn, to KTWD's General

5 Manager and Water Resources Manager, respectively, Steven Dalke and Skye Grass. These

6 emails document just some of SWID's attempts to engage KTWD in a discussion about the

7 environmental impacts of Cross Valley Canal deliveries on the water quality in the Friant-Kern

8 Canal. For example, Mr. Munn sent an email on May 17, 2018 to representatives from several

9 agencies, including KTWD. (Exh. A, p. 1.) That email noted that "SWID's primary concern

10 relate[s] to the proposed discharge of Cross Valley Canal (CVC) water into the Friant Kern Canal

11 (FKC) and potentially significant water quality impacts to SWID's surface and groundwater

-1016 Floor puz q032S edeseuy d'IT'XDANHOS HHAXVA LIVAH NIAISNMOXg 12 irrigation supplies and associated adverse water quality impacts on soils and crops in SWID

13 among other things." (Ibid.) On October 11, 2018, Mr. Munn circulated results from recent
'CIECICS TIUES 14 laboratory testing of water quality at SWID's Friant-Kern Canal turnouts to a list of recipients

15 that included Steven Dalke, KTWD's General Manager. (Exh. A, pp. 4-9.) As Mr. Munn noted,

16 he understood the water subject to the recent water quality testing was "coming from the Cross

17 Valley Canal." (Exh. A, p. 4.) As this email stated: "The unmitigated use of this quality of water

18 is damaging to the crops and groundwater quality in SWID as compared to the water supplies it

19 would receive from Millerton." (Ibid.) In a September 2018 email exchange between Dana
20 Munn and Skye Grass (of KTWD), Mr. Munn inquired whether water would be pumped over the

21 Shafter Check pursuant to KTWD's delivery schedule. (Exh. A, p. 11.) In subsequent email

22 that included KTWD's General Manager, Mr. Munn expressed his concern that until he inquired,

23 he was "not told any Cross Valley Canal Water (CVC) was going over the Shafter Check. They
24 do provide a schedule of CVC Water to be moved but it could be going to Arvin Edison or North

25 Kern and not over the Shafter Check." (Exh. A, p. 10.)
These emails illustrate the ways in which SWID attempted to convey its concerns 26 23.

27 regarding the water quality impacts of Cross Valley Canal water being discharged into the Friant-

28 Kern Canal - as is expressly authorized under and facilitated by KTWD's Renewal Contracts.

8
AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 SWID's concerns regarding the water quality impacts of KTWD taking delivery of CVP water

2 via the Cross Valley Canal was fully known to Steven Dalke and Skye Grass, who were still

3 employed by KTWD at the time the Renewal Contracts were adopted in February 2020. Despite
4 repeatedly expressing its concerns regarding the lack of communication regarding Cross Valley

5 Canal deliveries, SWID has been unable to achieve any meaningful dialogue with KTWD about

6 this issue.

7 24. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), Reclamation

8 prepared an Environmental Assessment (the "EA") on the 2020-2022 renewal of Delta Division

9 CVP contracts for all seven Cross Valley Canal contractors: County of Fresno, County of Tulare,
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 Hills Valley Irrigation District, Kern-Tulare Water District, Lower Tule River Irrigation District,

11 Pixley Irrigation District, and Tri-Valley Water District. As stated in the EA:
ILZ-101€6 VO 'RIEQIES 100 1il puz '1334) edeaeuy 12OI 12 The Cross Valley Canal allows water to be conveyed between the California

13 Aqueduct (Aqueduct) and the Friant-Kern Canal. . ..

14 Cross Valley Contractors (Table 1) are CVP contractors that are geographically located within the Friant Division but receive their CVP supplies from the
15 Delta. Due to direct conveyance hurdles, Cross Valley Contractors obtain their CVP supplies either by direct delivery from the Cross Valley Canal or via

16 associated transfers for Friant Division CVP supplies and other sources pursuant to Article 5(a) of their water service contracts." (Emphasis added.)
17 To Petitioner's knowledge, KTWD is currently the only Cross Valley Canal contractor that uses
18 reverse-flow delivery to pump water from the Delta up the Friant-Kern Canal, past SWID's intake

19 facilities.

20 25. On or around December 12, 2019, SWID submitted four-page comment letter to

21 Reclamation regarding the Cross Valley Contractors' interim renewal contracts. That comment

22 letter explained the nature of SWID's interest in the quality of water in the Friant-Kern Canal and

23 expressed concerns that water delivered from the Cross Valley Canal was significantly higher in

24 salts than Friant-Kern Canal supplies from Lake Millerton. In that letter, SWID also expressed its

25 view that all agencies should be analyzing potential impacts under CEQA, which, as the letter

26 noted, imposes additional substantive requirements beyond NEPA, such as the incorporation of

27 feasible mitigation measures.

28 /11

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

26. In the ensuing two months, KTWD made no attempt to engage SWID regarding

2 SWID's concerns with the Renewal Contracts and the associated impacts to the water quality.
KTWD did not disclose whether any changes would be made to the Renewal Contracts based on

4 the concerns SWID raised, or whether KTWD would adopt any monitoring or mitigation

5 measures to address the water quality impacts of discharging Cross Valley Canal water into the

6 Friant-Kern Canal.

7 27. On Friday, February 21, 2020, SWID's special counsel, Doug Gosling, received an

8 email from KTWD's administrative assistant, Tara Parmenter, notifying him that KTWD would

9 hold a special meeting on February 26, 2020 and attaching a copy of the one-page meeting
LLP ÉMONNHOS MHAXVA LIVAH NIZISNMOXA agenda. A true and correct copy of this email and the attached agenda are attached hereto as 10

11 Exhibit B and incorporated by reference. Although this agenda mentioned the potential filing of 1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor ILZ-101£6 VO 'E/Bq/0E HUES 12 a notice of exemption ("NOE") for the Renewal Contracts, the agenda did not mention CEQA nor

13 did it give any indication of which categorical and/or statutory exemption KTWD intended to rely

14 upon.

15 28. After receiving a copy of the special meeting agenda, Mr. Gosling responded by

16 email that same day requesting a copy of the meeting packet. A true and correct copy of that

17 email is attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated by reference. On the morning of Monday;

18 February 24, 2020, Mr. Gosling received an email from KTWD's Water Resources Manager,

19 Skye Grass, without any additional information and stating in cursory fashion: "All materials will

20 be made available pursuant to the applicable provisions of the government code for special

21 meetings." A true and correct copy of that email is attached hereto as Exhibit D and incorporated

22 by reference.

23 29. Mr. Gosling received no further correspondence, meeting packet, or any other

24 materials prior to the February 26, 2020 meeting. Besides the meeting agenda, no additional

25 materials were available on KTWD's website - not even the Renewal Contracts proposed to be

26 executed, nor any explanatory staff report or Board letter. KTWD's refusal to provide meeting

27 packet violated Government Code section 54954.1, a provision of the Brown Act that requires a
28 public agency to provide "a copy of all documents constituting the agenda packet" when

10
AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 presented with such request in writing. Accordingly, KTWD failed to provide the notice required

2 by law.

30. Faced with KTWD's refusal to provide any further materials associated with the 3

4 Renewal Contracts or the NOEs, SWID nonetheless attempted to exhaust administrative remedies

5 to the best of its ability. Because SWID was unable to obtain any additional information about

6 the items to be discussed at KTWD's February 26, 2020 meeting, SWID submitted a letter on

7 February 25, 2020 that incorporated a by reference a copy of SWID's prior December 12, 2019

8 letter to Reclamation concerning NEPA and CEQA issues with the Interim Renewal Contracts for

9 the Cross Valley Contractors (which included the Renewal Contracts approved by KTWD). A

10 true and correct copy of that letter is attached hereto as Exhibit E and incorporated by reference.

13 IR18 and 14-06-200-8367A-IR18), SWID surmised in its February 25, 2020 transmittal that the CICQICH TIUES 14 contracts "appear[ed]" to be the same as what SWID had previously commented on in the context
15 of Reclamation's NEPA process. (Exh. E, p. 1.) But due to KTWD's refusal to communicate
16 about the contents of the February 26, 2020 special meeting item, SWID had no way of knowing
17 whether the Renewal Contracts had been amended, whether any monitoring or mitigation
18 measures had been adopted, or what the claimed basis was for KTWD's CEQA exemptions.
Mr. Gosling attended KTWD's special meeting on February 26, 2020. When he
20 walked into the room, he was handed a copy of materials exceeding 250 pages. Neither Mr. 19 32.

21 Gosling nor any other SWID representative was given an adequate opportunity to review the
22 Renewal Contracts or the claimed basis for the CEQA exemptions, but instead had mere minutes
23 to review the materials before the meeting commenced. Mr. Gosling stated for the record that he
had not been given adequate time to offer comments on the meeting materials provided to him or
25 the action that the agency planned to take, and needed an opportunity for discussion with his client 24

26 and qualified individuals to provide informed comments. Mr. Gosling requested the KTWD
27 Board of Directors postpone approval of the resolutions pending adequate review.

II 28 /11

AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

33. KTWD's Board of Directors nonetheless approved two resolutions authorizing the

2 execution of the Renewal Contracts and the "filing" of an NOE for each. Although not disclosed

3 to the public prior to its February 26, 2020 special meeting, KTWD relied upon two CEQA

4 exemptions in approving the Project without environmental review: the categorical exemption

5 for existing facilities pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15301 and the statutory exemption for

6 certain rate-setting activities pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15273. The NOEs were

7 posted with the Kern County Clerk's office on March 2, 2020.

8 34. Despite KTWD failing to provide the notice required by law and forcing SWID to
comment on the Project without adequate notice or information, the grounds for noncompliance
LLP MOTHHOS NAHAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOHI 10 with CEQA alleged in this Petition are consistent with the objections to the Project that SWID

11 raised repeatedly in conversations and correspondence with SWID, including in its Santa BIEqITE VO 93101-2711 s00la put 13045 edeosuy 170l 12 February 25, 2020 comment letter.

13 35. If any specific grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws
14 alleged in this Petition were not raised prior to KTWD's February 26, 2020 approval of the
15 Project, it was because KTWD refused to provide a meeting packet or any additional information
16 regarding the Project, and therefore failed to give notice required by law. Moreover, KTWD's
17 history of ignoring SWID's water quality concerns coupled with KTWD's flagrant refusal to
18 provide any materials associated with the proposed Project indicates that SWID's attempt to
19 exhaust administrative remedies appeared to be futile in any event. KTWD knew about SWID's
20 specific water quality concerns, and had an obligation to at least disclose the requisite information
21 to allow SWID to formulate and offer constructive comments on KTWD's proposed Project.

22 36. SWID has therefore met the requirement under CEQA to exhaust its administrative

23 remedies. In the alternative, any defect in SWID's attempt to exhaust administrative remedies is

24 excused either by KTWD's failure to provide notice as required by law, pursuant to Public
25 Resources Code section 21177(e), or under the doctrine of futility.

26 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
27 37. The Cross Valley Canal is a joint-use facility owned by various participants,
28 including Cross Valley Canal Contractors and Arvin-Edison Water Storage District. The Cross

Valley Canal can convey water from the California Aqueduct to the Kern Water Bank, the City of

2 Bakersfield groundwater recharge facility, the Berrenda Mesa Property, the Pioneer Banking

3 Project, the Kern River channel, to Arvin-Edison's Intake Canal, or to various member units of

second 4 Kern County Water Authority and other districts who have access to the Cross Valley Canal.

5 When needed, the Cross Valley Canal is also capable of conveying 500 cubic feet per

6 (cfs), in reverse flow-gravity mode, to the California Aqueduct. In 2008, as part of the Cross

7 Valley Canal expansion project, an additional 500 cfs turnout was constructed to provide 500 cfs

8 of flow between the Friant-Kern Canal and the Cross Valley Canal. From there the Cross Valley

9. Canal water can be delivered to the Friant-Kern Canal through the use of a pumping lift. SWID is
ITT'NOUNHOS NAHAVA LIVAH NIALSNMONH 10 informed and believes that KTWD brings water from the California Aqueduct into the Friant-

11 Kern Canal, past SWID's intake, through this pumping lift. ITLZ-I01C6 VO *NIEQIBH BIUBS 1001d puz '1034S edroeuy 170I 12 38. SWID is informed and believes that KTWD's Project has the potential to degrade

13 Friant-Kern Canal supplies, at a minimum, by increasing sodium, chloride, and boron in the water

14 taken by SWID from the Friant-Kern Canal. SWID is required to work within a variety of State

15 of California regulatory programs, including the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control

16 Board's Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program and the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for

17 Long-Term Sustainability Program. The Project threatens to impair SWID's ability to comply

18 with its regulatory mandates under those programs.

19 39. Pursuant to the mandates of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

20 ("SGMA"), a groundwater sustainability plan ("GSP") was adopted for the Kern County

of the Kern Groundwater 21 subbasin, which SWID's service area overlies. SWID is a part

22 Authority, which adopted a GSP aimed at achieving SGMA's legal mandate of achieving

23 "sustainability" by the year 2040. This means that for the first time, the Kern County subbasin is

24 being managed under a state mandate to avoid six statutorily defined "undesirable results,"

25 including degraded groundwater quality trends.

26 40. The potentially significant impacts to SWID'S agricultural users and its water

2 or near SWID's turnout have never been addressed by KTWD. This is in spite of KTWD being

3 presented with laboratory test results during discussions about Friant-Kern Canal water quality.

41.

4 SWID, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the
relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is commenced.

5 42. SWID has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law to

6 redress the claims pleaded herein.

7 43. SWID has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

8 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to Respondent prior to the

LIVAH NIZISNMONA dTT'NONHHOS HHHaVA 9 commencement of this suit, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit F.

10 44. SWID has also served a copy of this Petition as amended on the California

1021 Anacapa 400Ld puz 1aa4s 11
BILZ-IOLEG VO 'RIEQIRg NURS Attorney General as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

12 45. SWID hereby and by a separate election notified KTWD that SWID elects to

13 prepare

14 the record of proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project in compliance with

15 Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). A copy of such notice was filed
concurrently with SWID's original Petition.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17

18 [Violation of California Environmental Quality Act, PRC S8 21168, 21168.5]

46.

19 Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 36 as though they
were set forth in full herein.

20 47.

21 KTWD determined that the Project was statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to

22 CEQA Guidelines section 15273 and categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA

Guidelines section 15301.

23 48.

24 The relied-on exemptions do not apply to this Project. Neither the statutory nor
categorical exemption was proper to rely on in these circumstances.
25 49.

26 As to the statutory exemption, KTWD improperly determined that the Project is

27 exempt from CEQA on the basis of the statutory exemption for the "establishment, modification,

28 structuring, restructuring, or approval of rates, tolls, fares, and other charges by public agencies
which the public agency finds are for the purpose of . . . Meeting operating expenses, including

14

21884029.3 AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 employee wage rates and fringe benefits." This exemption is inapplicable because the Renewal

2 Contracts include operational details of water service delivery that go beyond the establishment of

3 rates.

4 50. More problematic still for KTWD's claimed exemption, the Renewal Contracts do

5 not involve any "rates, tolls, fares, [or] other charges" imposed by KTWD. The fact that the

6 Renewal Contracts address certain payments owed by KTWD to Reclamation and DWR do not

7 transform the Renewal Contracts into the sort of rate-setting action contemplated by this statutory

8 exemption. This Project does not just involve setting a rate for customers to pay. This Project

9 expressly approves the transfer of water which will cause direct and indirect impacts on the

10

11 significantly degrade the water quality in the Friant-Kern Canal. The statutory exemption for rate 100Ld puz *229415 edesguy 114Z-10L1 S VO BUEGIEg BJUES JTT'NOIHHOS HIAHVA LIVAH NIZISNMONg environment. A physical change to the environment will occur due to the Project because it will

12 setting therefore does not apply.

13 51. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

14 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

15 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

16 52. There are "unusual circumstances" concerning the Project arising from the fact

17 that the Renewal Contracts provide for the delivery of CVP water to KTWD via the Cross Valley

18 Canal, allowing for the introduction of water from the California Aqueduct into the Friant-Kern

19 Canal. The circumstances of this Reclamation service contract are unusual in that they involve

20 the use of existing and fixed conveyance infrastructure, but involve variable operations as to the

21 source of water conveyed. These unusual circumstances give rise to potentially significant
22 environmental impacts: as SWID has repeatedly expressed, the discharge of Cross Valley Canal

23 water into the Friant-Kern Canal has significant water quality impacts to SWID's surface and

24 groundwater irrigation supplies and associated adverse water quality impacts on soils and crops

25 within SWID's service area.

26 53. a SWID overlies a closed groundwater basin and the introduction of degraded water

27 supplies tend to accumulate in the groundwater and become worse over time. KTWD has tended

28 to rely upon Cross Valley Canal water pumped up the Friant-Kern Canal during times of drought.

15
AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
21884029.3

1 Currently, south-of-Delta agricultural water service contractors are allocated only 15% of their
contract supply and, accordingly, it is anticipated that KTWD may rely heavily upon deliveries of 2

3 Cross Valley Canal water during the 2020-2022 time period, compared to existing operations.

4 Moreover, the increasing and unaddressed potential for water quality degradation has become

5 more pronounced with the adoption of a GSP for the Kern County subbasin in early 2020 and the

6 legal imperative to manage groundwater to avoid undesirable results, including water quality

7 degradation.

8 54. The discharge of degraded water has impacts which worsen over time and now

9 threaten to have catastrophic and longstanding impacts on SWID's customers. There are roughly
d'TT'NOIHHOS MUAXVA HYATI NIAISNMONS 10 21,600 acres of almond trees within SWID's service area. The almond trees within SWID's

11 service area are of a specific rootstock that is both particularly high-yield and especially sensitive UELZ-10:C6 VO EABQHEA BdES 1001d puz 13ang edeseuy IZOI 12 to the quality of applied water. The impacts of applying saltier water to almond trees now

13 threatens to diminish the viability of agricultural operations within SWID's service area, during

14 the term of the 2020-2022 Renewal Contracts.

15 55. The significant impacts and unusual circumstances described above make it

this water diversion. There 16 impossible for KTWD to rely on a categorical exemption to approve

17 is more than a reasonable possibility under these circumstances that the Project will have :

18 significant effect on the environment. Accordingly, KTWD improperly determined that the

19 Project is categorically exempt from CEOA.

20 56. KTWD's improper determination that the Project is exempt from the provisions of

21 CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 22

23 WHEREAS, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

24 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus:

Subject: RE: Acknowledgement of Transfer - SOD-18-08 - San Luis WD to Kern-Tulare WD
The Shafter Wasco Irrigation District's (SWID) has received and reviewed the attached transfer and schedule.

SWID's primary concern relate to the proposed discharge of Cross Valley Canal (CVC) water into the Friant Kern Canal (FKC) and potentially significant water quality impacts to SWID's surface and groundwater irrigation supplies and associated adverse water quality impacts on soils and crops in SWID among other things.

Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District and other Friant contractors are currently engaged in a forum being hosted by the
current operating non-federal entity of the FKC to address the specific issue of water introduced into the FKC as part of
the contract to design pump-back facilities for the lower end of the FKC. Based on the accepted scope of work for this
effort as well as our participation in the initial contractor meetings that have been held, we believe this is an appropriate
additional forum for further pursuing a science-based understanding of potential water quality impacts of introducing water into the FKC, as well as additional appropriate measures to address those impacts. This will likely result in a

Exhibit A Page 1 of 19

refinement of the Friant Water Authority's and Bureau of Reclamation's quality standards and guidelines applicable to introducing water into the FKC which will be applied to CVC supplies.

Subject: Kern Tulare Cross Valley Canal Water

My recollection was correct per the attached several emails. Until I asked on September 5 we were not told any Cross
Valley Canal Water (CVC) was going over the Shafter Check. They do provide a schedule of CVC Water to be moved but it could be going to Arvin Edison or North Kern and not over the Shafter Check.

Hey Tent and Gary,

I hope you are doing well. I have sharpened my pencil, so to speak, and come up with the total amount KT will need
delivered from the Cross Valley to the Friant Kern Canal.

We would like a total of 7,650 AF to be delivered by the end of the year.

Based on my conversation with Gary, I believe this will take the remainder of September and part of October, and then
shut off for the remainder of the year.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Gentlemen:

We are in receipt of the above meeting notice. Although we have not received any other
information on the above agenda items they appear to be the same subject that the Shafter-
Wasco Irrigation District ("SWID") previously provided comments in the attached letter dated
December 12, 2019. SWID has not changed its position in defending its water quality and will
continue to defend against any reduction in the water quality it receives.

Very truly yours,

Re: Draft Environmental Assessment Central Valley Project Interim Renewal
Contracts for Cross Valley Contractors 2020-2022 Draft EA-19-044

The Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District ("SWID") has reviewed the above-entitled
document per the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., the Centrai Valley Project Improvement Act ("CVPIA"), Public Law 102 - 575, and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. The
renewal of interim water service contracts was first evaluated in 1994 with supplemental
review with roll-over documents and now tiered documents to those previous reviews.

As you know, SWID receives water from the southerly portion of Friant Kern Canal.
SWID outlets from the Friant Kern Canal ("FKC") are above the second to last check

structure, the Shafter Check, on the FKC. Thus, SWID has had long interest in the
Bureau's actions and specifically with the actions of specific agencies contracting for the
renewal of such cross valley project supplies. The above referenced project does not specifically propose to pump water over the Shafter Check to facilitate reverse flow of the FKC. There are exchanges referenced but said exchanges do not discuss specifically
pumping water over the Shafter Check. We believe there is a compelling need for detailed evaluation of long-term and cumulative impacts of district-level water quality when pumping over the Shafter Check and consider NEPA and CEQA compliance issues
to be significant and desire to work with those agencies to resolve our concerns to avoid
further impacts.

SWID is concerned over the difference in water quality delivered to it. The Cross Valley
Canal water is significantly higher in salts than FKC supplies from Millerton Reservoir.
Should the project include a any potential for a reduced water quality to SWID then the
environmental documents are insufficient and need additional work by the Bureau to
analyze potential impacts to SWID. In addition, as the FKC operating entity, Friant Water
Authority, and the contracting Districts are all agencies formed and operating under State of California law-they should also be analyzing potential impacts under the California
Environmental Quality Act. Upon review, some of the elements that must be included in
an environmental impact report are not required by an environmental impact statement.
And, NEPA is merely procedural' whereas CEQA, in addition to its procedural
requirements, contains substantive provisions with which agencies must comply. The most important of these is Pub. Resources Code § 21002, requiring public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen those effects.2 Finally, CEQA thus
places a higher priority on environmental values than NEPA.3

In part, SWID's areas of interest stem from its on-going activities with the FKC water quality regiment, subsidence in the FKC, and a variety of State of California regulatory

programs. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) mandates the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP) and a CVSALTS Program. Under the ILRP regulations, the CVRWQCB is limiting the use of groundwater with high nitrate levels. In addition, the CVSALTS Program is envisioned to limit the salt (TDS and/or EC) loading on agricultural irrigated land. Along with a variety of projects that discharge water into the FKC that have cumulative impacts to SWID and other users:
S-year FKC Groundwater Pump-In Program
San Joaquin River Restoration Program Recapture and Recirculation EIR
Kaweah River Pump-in Program

Cawelo Water District Warren Act
Rosedale Rio-Bravo and Delano Earlimart Irrigation District
Banking Program
Kern Tulare Water District Return of Banked Water
North Kern Water Storage District Recovery and Transportation of Banked Water
We believe it possible to have some focused discussion to prevent degradation of water quality in the FKC.

Should the above project specifically preclude the pumping of water over the Shafter Check then the prior comments by SWID can be disregarded. However, if the project contemplates or will engage in pumping water over the Shafter Check, then the project document is impermissibly narrow in its project goals, it has flawed assumptions, and thus its reliance on outdated and inapplicable methodologies, and a cursory a treatment of reasonable alternatives renders its fatally defective as an information document under the
relevant statutes. SWID acknowledges the significant efforts made by the Bureau and its
