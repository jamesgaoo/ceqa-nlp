28 Sacramento and the Sacramento County Office of Economic Development and Marketing.

PRTITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

INTRODUCTION 1

2. 1. Defendant and Respondent County of Sacramento ("County") is presently serving
3 as the land-use authority for the concurrent processing of multiple master-planned communities
4 along the Jackson Highway Corridor that will include tens of thousands of new homes in the
5 southeastern portion of the County, One of those projects--the Mather South Community Master
6 Plan ("Project")-ia owned by the Sacramento County Office of Economic Development and
Marketing ("Office of Eeonomic Development"). Real Parties in Interest Mather South, LLC and
Lewis Operating Corp, have acquired the rights to develop the Project. That Project, in
9 comparison to the others, has been given preferential treatment by the County,

2. On January 28, 2020, the County, acting through its Board of Supervisors,
11 approved the Project and certified a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR"), notwithstanding 10

T IPYPAW g sje8uew. 12 the Board's on-the-record concerns that the FEIR failed to adequately address and disclose
13 multiple categories of environmental impacts, in violation of the California Environmental Quality
WEINI 14 Act ("CRQA").

15 3. The Board's primary concerns related to the adequacy of the Project's climate
16 change analysis in the FEIR, which purports to comply with "the Sacramento County thresholds of
17 significance for 2020 and 2032" in the County's 2011 Climate Action Plan ("2011 CAP").
18 Specifically, the Board noted that the FEIR's conclusion of purported compliance with the
19 County's climate change "thresholds of significance" was unsupported and inaccurate because the
20 County has never adopted climate change significance thresholds, either in the 2011 CAP or

21 elsewhere.

22 4. In fact, despite the FEIR's assertion of compliance, the FEIR acknowledges, in a
23 footnote displayed in a reduced font size, that "Greenhouse gas thresholds for 2030 have not been
24 formally adopted by the County and are not readily available on the County's website. Thresholds
25 were provided to [the County's air quality consultant] Ascent Environmental for use in this
26 analysis."

28 FEIR regarding compliance with significance thresholds. Instead, the Supervisors recognized that 27 5. The Supervisors, to their credit, were unwilling to support the assertions in the

2
ATOOA ImTP ADSAMANITTO

1 no such thresholds exist, and that the 2011 CAP is a mere policy document, based on the
2 regulatory environment at the time, that was intended to guide the development of a future
regulatory program-a program that remains undeveloped more than eight years later.

6. Supervisor Phil Serna recognized that the County had failed to develop a regulatory
5 program for olimate change, stating:

6 However, with all of that said, I do tend to agree with the concerns that were expressed by a few speakers today, that we do not have a climate action plan against which to gauge this development. And this is one of four that we're going to be asked -- these are big master plans that are going to result in tens of thousands of units eventually with all the benefit and all the shelter, new neighborhoods, population growth in Sacramento County, but also the impacts that come with that growth.
10
*
11
D VI Buder & Mitchel ur WEINI 12 So do have grave concerns about the lack of a climate action plan as part of what we're being asked to consider when it comes not to just this project, but to all

13 our master plans in Sacramento County.

14 7. Accordingly, Supervisor Seraa voted against the Project:

15 Well, I've got to tell you as someone that not only sits on this board but also sits on the local Air Quality Management District board of directors and the California Air
16 Resources board -- someone that is pretty intimately involved with addressing

17 greenhouse gas emissions through state policy and resource allocation at the state
level as well as the local level, I have a need to be very consistent in who I am as E

18 public representative and what positions I hold.

19 8. Supervisor Don Nottoli also recognized the County' s failure:

20 So, back to the project, and I want to thank again those who weighed in from the enviroumental community on the climate action plan, I would concur that it's
21 probably past time, when this board -- again, that's not going to necessarily be an easy discussion, but nonetheless with the backdrop, I think, of development in the
22 County and community is probably important that we have that before us.

23 9. Supervisor Patrick Kennedy added:
24 To the Chair and to staff, I will say I completely agree on the Chair on the urgency

25 we have to step up our level of urgency for a climate plan. I completely agree. / don't want to hold up this process, I don't think it's fair to the applicant or to the
26 process. I want to respect the process itself, but that's not to say that I don't completely agree with the Chair, that we're behind the eight ball on this thing, and
27 we got to get moving on it.

28

OD F AAIN ARATIO

10. Despite the Supervisors' record statements that directly contradict the entire
2 premise of the climate change analysis in the FEIR, the Board nevertheless approved the Project
3 by a 4-1 vote, signaling a desire not to "hold up this process" any longer, irrespective of CEQA's
4 command to fully and accurately analyze and disclose impacts from greenhouse gas emissions,

5 11, Thus, the Board's approval of the Project notwithstanding its concerns regarding

6 the adequacy of the FEIR suggests the County is giving favorable treatment to its own Project,
7 owned by the Office of Economic Development, and that it's willing to ignore CEQA in order to

2 do sO,

12. The County's approval of the Project (i) constitutes an abuse of discretion; (ii)
10 violates multiple procedural and substantive provisions of CEQA; and (iii) is based on analysis

V.. Butler & Mitchell ur 11 and findings that are not supported by substantial evidence, and, in certain instances, are contrary
P3 INEINI 12 to the factual evidence in the record, including the record statements of the Board of Supervisors.

13 13, Petitioner therefore brings this action challenging the County's approval of the
14 Project and its certification of the FRIR,

15 PARTIES

16 14. Plaintiff and Petitioner Tsakopoulos Investments, LLC ("Petitioner") is, and at all
17 times has been, a limited liability company formed under California law and doing business
18 throughout the State of California, including the County of Sacramento. Petitioner is the majority

19 owner of approximately 1,391 acres of land located southwest of the Project and is the applicant
20 for a master-planned community proposed for development thereon. Petitioner has a significant
21 and beneficial interest in the subject matter of this action, including the Project's compliance with
22 applicable laws and regulations and the County's review of the Project's environmental impacts in
23 accordance with CEQA, because the Project and its environmental impacts will directly and
24 indirectly affect Petitioner's property, the natural environment adjacent to and around Petitioner's
25 property, the local and regional airsheds, as well as the future County residents who may
26 eventually inhabit the master-planned community proposed for development on Petitioner's land.
27 Indeed, the Project's inadequately analyzed and unmitigated significant impacts will force
28 Petitioner to bear the brunt of the environmental impacts caused by the County's decision not to

1 "hold up this process" any longer instead of requiring the Project to comply with CEQA.
2 Petitioner is also beneficially interested in the subject matter of this litigation because its

3 managing member resides in the County and will therefore be directly and indirectly affected by
4 the Project and its environmental impacts, including but not limited to vehicle trips, noise, and air

5 emissions. Accordingly, Petitioner's prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on

6 the public by protecting the public from the Project's inadequately analyzed and under-mitigated
environmental impacts alleged herein.
15, Defendant and Respondent County of Sacramento is a political subdivision of the

9 State of California and is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the County in
10 accordance with applicable laws and regulations, including CEQA. For purposes of Public

3 11 Resources Code section 21067, the County is the "lead agency" responsible for conducting
WEINL 12 environmental reviow of the Project in accordance with CEQA.

13 16. Defendant and Respondent Sacramento County Office of Economic Development
14 and Marketing is a County agency and the agency through which the County owns the Project.

15 17. Real Party in Interest Mather South, LLC is a limited liability company formed
16 under California law and doing business throughout the State of California, including the County
17 of Sacramento, and is the Project Applicant.

18 18. Real Party in Interest Lewis Operating Corp. is a California corporation formed
19 under California law and doing business throughout the State of California, including the County

20 of Sacramento, and is an is affiliate, partner, and/or subsidiary of Real Party in Interest Mather
21 South, LLC.

22 19. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
23 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of DOES through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues said
24 respondents under fictitious names, Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names
25 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent and/or
26 employee of the County, and each performed aots on which this action is based within the course

27 and scope of the County's agency and/or employment.

1 JURISDICTION

2 20. This action is brought pursuant to Code of Ciyil Procedures sections 1085 and

3 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5.

4 21. Venue for this action properly lies within the Sacramento County Superior Court
5 because the Project is located within the County and is therefore where the Project's environmental

6 impacts will occur.
22, Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
8 21167.5 by serving written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on the County
9 on February 28, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service are attached hereto as
10 Bxhibit A,

11 23.
LV. Butier & Mitchell uy 3 NEIND Petitioner has also complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

DA  Jefier Mangels 12 section 21167.6 by concurrently requesting that the County prepare the record of administrative
13 proceedings related to this action.

14 24. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
15 has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including but not
16 limited to submitting detailed written comments objecting to the approval of the Project, and also
17 verbally informing the County of certain CEQA violations with respect to its evaluation of the
18 Project's environmental impacts during the January 28, 2020 hearing before the Board.

19 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
20 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate requiring the County to set aside its
21 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in
22 effect in violation of state law.

23 26. This action is timely filed in accordance with Public'Resources Code section
24 21167.

20

21 34. (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief - Violations of CEQA

22 Paragraphs 1-33 are hereby incorporated by reference.

35. "CEQA's informational purposes are not satisfied by an EIR that simply ignores or
23 assumes a solution". Vineyard Area Cltizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho
24 Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 430-431. "Decision makers must, under the law, be presented

26 36, "But the EIR bas another function: the informing of the executive and legislative
27l branches of government, state and local, and of the general public of the effect of the project on
28 that revered resource which we call 'The Environment.' Obviously, the impact often must be

5 Coastside County Water Dist. (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 695, 705.
37. Here, the County's approval of the Project notwithstanding its concerns regarding
the adequacy of the FEIR constitutes an abuse of discretion, An "Abuse of discretion is

8 established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or

9 decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence."
10| C.C.P. § 1094.5(b).
Inadequate Analysis of Climate Change Impacts 11
mn jeupn 8 apng NENL 12 38. In 2006, CEQA was amended by the State Legislature to require that impacts to
13 climate change be analyzed in environmental impact reports ("EIRs"). Health & Safety Code §8
14 38500-38599. Since then, there have been a series of published decisions from the California
15 Supreme Court and appellate courts that help guide the preparation of adequate climate change
16 analyses in accordance with applicable provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
17 39. However, rather than trying to comply with the applicable procedural and
18 substantive legal standards, the County included in the FEIR a climate change analysis that is
19 incomplete, not supported by substantial evidence, and internally inconsistent.

20 40. The climate change analysis is in Chapter 7 of the FEIR, In response to public
21 comments on the DEIR, the County made significant revisions to the climate change analysis. Of
22 particular note is the County's revision that states, "The analysis contained in this EIR is based on
23| the project-specific Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan prepared for the project consistent with
24 CBQA Guidelines Sections 15183.5(b) and 15064." FEIR, p. 178. But the FEIR does not state
25 where the so-called "project-specific Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan" can be found and reviewed
26 by interested members of the public, In fact, the term "Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan" is not
27 referenced elsewhere in Chapter 7. Nor is the term "project-specific Greenhouse Gas Reduction
28 Plan" referenced any where in CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b).

8

1 41. Further, although CEQA Guidelines Section 15183.5(b) allows development
2 projects to use greenhouse gas reduction plans, typically adopted to regulate greenhouse gas

3 emissions on a city- or county-wide basis, to assess a project's impacts to climate change in an
4 EIR, the use of such plans is subject to strict prerequisites. Most significant is the requirement that

5 any such greenhouse gas reduction plan be "adopted following certification of an EIR or adoption
of an environmental document." CEQA Guidelines § 15183.5(b)(2). That never occurred. As the
Supervisors' on-the-record statements shown above recognize, the County failed to adopt a
CBQA-compliant climate action plan or greenhouse gas reduction plan, and no evidence even
9 suggests the 2011 CAP qualifies as either. The FEIR acknowledges this reality, stating that the

Burter & Mitchell up 10 2011 CAP is not a "'qualified' plan[] through which subsequent projects may receive CEQA
11 streamlining benefits." FEIR, p. 178. Rather, the 2011 CAP is merely a policy document
12 outlining the County's "Strategy and Framework" for its eventual "Phase 2" CAP, which, among
13 other things, was supposed to "determine the GHG reduction targets which are required" and
14 "propose measures to achieve the required GHG reductions for the entire County.")
15 42. Recognizing that there is no qualified climate action plan or greenhouse gas
16 reduction plan establishing significance thresholds for use in evaluating the impacts of the
17 Project's greenhouse gas emissions to climate change, the County revised the FEIR to assert that,
18 on second thought, and after the close of public review of the Project DEIR, it previously adopted
19 climate change "2020 significance thresholds" in the EIR prepared for its 2011 General Plan
20 Update. FEIR, p. 179. This is a misstatement of what was discussed in the cited provisions of the
21 2011 General Plan Update.

22 43. In furtherance of its post-hoc explanation regarding the alleged adoption of 2020
23 climate change significance thresholds in the 2011 General Plan Update, the County also revised
24 footnote 1 on FEIR page 179, which previously acknowledged that, "Greenhouse gas emissions

25 thresholds have not been formally adopted by the County and are not readily available on the
26 County's website." FEIR, p. 179, fn. 1. That revised footnote

27 now suggests that significance

28 https://planning.saccounty.net/PlansandProjectsIn-Progress/Pages/CAP.aspx

thresholds were previously adopted; but, were not made publicly available and were "provided to
2 [the County's air quality consultant] Ascent Environmental for use in this analysis." Id.

3 44. With this revised story regarding the County's alleged prior adoption of 2020
4 climate change significance thresholds in place, the County proceeded to add yet another revised

5 section of analysis asserting that, "The 2030 significance thresholds in Table CC-1 below reflect
6 an update to the 2020 thresholds consistent with the reduction target established by [Senate Bill
7 32] of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, based on

8 the same methodology used to develop the 2020 significance thresholds." FEIR, p. 180. First,

9 there are no "2030 significance thresholds" depicted in Table CC-1, as suggested in the revised
10 climate change analysis. Rather, Table CC-1 depicts : comparison of 2005 greenhouse gas

11
D5IV Buder & Mitchell UP emissions to 2015 emissions; nothing about this table refers to 2030. Accordingly, there is a
PNEINI 12 significant evidentiary gap in the analytical roadmap provided to the public in support of this part
13 of the FEIR, which renders the analysis invalid. Second, the County's statement that, "The 2030
14 significance thresholds" are "based on the same methodology used to develop the 2020
15 significance thresholds" appears to be a reference to the type of analysis that was struck down by
16 the California Supreme Court in Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife
17 (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204. There, the Court invalidated the lead agency's attempt to demonstrate
18 compliance with the mandate imposed by Assembly Bill 32 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
19 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, by extrapolating the subject project's greenhouse gas
20 emission reductions and concluding that those emissions would be reduced by 31 percent after
21 mitigation, as well as the lack of any evidentiary link between statewide and project-specific
22| reduction levels. Id. at 225-226. The County's statement on FEIR page 181 demonstrates that it
23 used the same type of impermissible extrapolation-based approach rejected in Center for
24 Biological Diversity: "To evaluate the project in light of the 2050 statewide GHG reduction goal
25 identified in [Executive Order] B-30-15, the 2030 thresholds were extrapolated using a 7 percent
26 reduction". FEIR, p. 180.

27 45. After going through the detailed revisions of the FEIR. discussed above for the
28 purpose of trying to justify the legitimacy of the Project climate change analysis, the County took

10

a different approach to its analysis of construction-related greenhouse gas emissions and simply

2 concluded it that it did not have to analyze such emissions, The conclusion was unsupported by any

3 legal authority, is contrary to standard custom and practice, and understates impacts by eliminating
4 an entire class of emissions from the analysis. The County concluded that the analysis of
5 construction-related greenhouse gas emissions was not warranted because "the level of
6 construction activity required to build the new buildings in a region does not result in a cumulative
7 / increase in emissions because of their temporary nature." FEIR, p. 182. First, although

8 construction is "temporary,' greenhouse gas emissions are not-they're permanent. Second, the
9 County ignores that a Project of this magnitude-i.e., a master-planned community that will be
10 built out over many years- -will presumably have construction and operational phases that

Butler & Mitchell uP 11 overlap. Third, even assuming arguendo the truth of the County's assertion, this ignores the
" WENL 12 command of CEQA to "giv[e] due consideration to short term and long term effects." Pub. Res.
13 Code §15126(a) (emphasis added). Thus, the combination of construction- and operational-related
14 emissions need to be analyzed. Fourth, the build out and operation of the Project will presumably
15 overlap with the build out and operation of the other three Jackson Highway Corridor projects, all
16 of which were discussed in the cumulative impacts section; but, not considered with respect to the
17 Project's analysis of individual or cumulative construction-related climate change impacts. This
18 point is recognized in the Project air quality analysis, but not the climate change analysis. See
19 FEIR, p. 64 ["As the Mather South Project is developed, construction from other future planned
20 developments in Sacramento County could potentially overlap with the construction activities of
21 the project, potentially exposing newly sited sensitive receptors within the project area. These
22 developments include the NewBridge Master Plan, located to the south of the project, and the
23 Jackson Township Master Plan, located to the southwest of the project"].

24 Inadequate Analysis of Air Quality Impacts from Criteria Pollutants and Ozone Precursorg

25 46. In December 2018, the California Supreme Court invalidated the EIR prepared for
26 a large residential development because the air quality analysis did not correlate the subject
27 project's emissions of criteria air pollutants and ozone precursors to the adverse impacts of those
28 emissions to human health. Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502. The Court

11

•,,

held that the lead agency was required by CEQA to discuss the correlation between those project-
2 related air quality emissions and health conditions such as asthma, cardiovascular disease, and
3 breathing problems; and, if the agency determined it was not possible to provide such a discussion,

4 it must explain why, Id. at 520,

5 47. The FEIR was revised to include a reference to the Sierra Club decision, which was
6 published after the close of the public review and comment period for the DEIR. FEIR, p. 41.
7 However, the language revisions were made to the methodology section only---not the impact

8 analysis section, which remained unchanged. FEIR, pp. 48-61 [impacts analyses for construction

9 and long-term operational emissions of criteria air pollutants and precursors]. Thus, despite
10 including a reference to the Sierra Chib decision in the FEIR, the County did not make any

DIYI| Butter & Mitchell LP 11 attempt to corrclate the Project's air quality emissions to the adverse human health impacts. In
" WENI 12 fact, the analyses of impacts from construction and long-term operational emissions of criteria air
13 pollutants and ozone precursors at pages 48-61 of the FEIR do not include any discussion of
14 human health impacts. The County's failure to analyze and correlate the Project's air quality
15 emissions to the adverse human health impacts constitutes a violation of CEQA.
16 Inadequate Findingg

17 48. "We further conclude that implicit in section 1094.5 is a requirement that the
18 agency which renders the challenged decision must set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap
19 between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order." Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community

20 V. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.

21 49. The County's findings in support of its approval of the Project are not supported by
22 the evidence and in some instances are contrary to the record. Examples of such findings include
23 the County' findings regarding climate change, as discussed above, groundwater impacts, air
24 quality offset credits, air quality impacts from odors, and land-use incompatibility.

25 50. The Project is located downwind and just 700 feet from the Sacramento Rendering
26 Company (SRC), which processes animal waste and restaurant grease, The FEIR acknowledges
27 that, "Odor complaint data was provided by [Sacramento Metro Air Quality Management District
28 ('SMAQMD)] for the past 25 years and indicates that the facility generates objectionable odors to

12

1 neatby receptors." FBIR, p. 30. The FEIR added that, "Many of the VOCs emitted have low odor

2 detection thresholds, which means that they smell so strongly that the odor can be detected even
3 when very small amounts of the compound are present. For this reason, odors from a facility such

4 AS al rendering plant may continue to be detectable even at great distances and even if all feasible if
5 odor control devices are installed." Id. at 68. Although SRC is equipped with "odor control
6 equipment," "odors may still be detected even when this equipment is operated properly." Id. at
7 38. Thus, in CEQA terms, the odor impacts from SRC are significant and unavoidable.

8 51. In the section of the air quality analysis for exposure of sensitive receptors to odors,
9 the County acknowledged that the Project could lead to, "potential exposure of sensitive receptors
10 to odors associated with proposed land uses in the project area and the siting of new sensitive

LV.L Butter & Mitchell up WEINE 11 receptors in proximity to existing odor sources would be considered potentially significant."
12 FEIR, p. 69. The County then concluded that the potentially significant air quality impact would
13 be mitigated to a level less than significant through, "notification of potential lessees and future
14 landowners within the vicinity of the rendering plant". Id. at 70. However, the inclusion of
15 language in leases and deeds notifying future residents of an adjacent significant and unavoidable
16 air quality impact will not mitigate that impact---it will merely put those residents on notice of that
17 impact. Thus, the County's conclusion that air quality impacts to sensitive receptors (residents)
18 from odors is specious and not supported by substantial evidence.

19 52. The County's analysis of land-use conflicts associated with SRC operations suffers
20 from infirmities similar to those affecting the analysis of air quality impacts to sensitive receptors
21 from odors. The land-use conflicts analysis states that SRC, "currently occupies approximately
22 60-acres along the south side of Kiefer Boulevard, directly across the road from the southern
23 portion of the [Project,]" "with operations typically occurring 24 hours a day, seven days a week"
24 and impacts that "create loud noise day and night (from trucks and on-site equipment), involve
25 nighttime lighting, and generate objectionable odors." FEIR, p. 75. Yet the County concluded
26 that these significant impacts would be mitigated to a level less than significant through the
27 inclusion of language in leases and deeds notifying future residents of the adjacent land-use
28 conflict and associated significant impacts. Ibid. Again, notification language in leases and deeds

13

1 will not mitigate significant impacts, Further, to the extent the County asserts that it will mitigate
2 those significant impacts in the future through "standard conditions" (lbid), the FEIR does not

3 specify what those conditions are or provide any analysis supported with evidence to demonstrate
4 why "standard conditions" are sufficient to mitigate significant impacts associated with the SRC-
5 related land-use conflicts; nor does the FEIR include performance standards that would ensure
6 those standard mitigations are adequate when eventually implemented. Thus, the County's
7 conclusion that significant impacts associated with land-use conflicts will be mitigated to a level
8 less than significant is not supported by substantial evidence.

9 Inadequate Alternatives Analvsis

10 $3. Because the County's analyses of significant impacts (i) from land-use conflicts,

V.I. Butler & Mitchell uP INEONI 11 and (i) air quality impacts from odors, are not supported by substantial evidence, the County's
12 evaluation of Project alternatives is also flawed. It should be noted that the DEIR recognizes that
13 the southern portion of the Project-t.e., where future residents will be impacted by the significant
14 air quality impacts and land-use conflicts associated with SRC's "'24 hours a day, seven days a
15 week" operations--was supposed to be zoned for commercial-recreation, not residential. DEIR, p.
16 13-18. The FEIR does not explain why the most impacted part of the Project was switched to
17 residential zoning, nor does the FRIR include evidence demonstrating that the impacts of that
18 change were adequately analyzed under CEQA,

19 Failure to Recirculate FEIR

20 54. In the FEIR, the County added a new "Preface" section stating that its revisions to
21 the FEIR did not trigger recirculation pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5. FEIR, pp. 0-

22 1-0-3. A lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when "significant new information" is
23 added to the EIR. after the close of public review, but prior to certification. CEQA Guidelines §
24 15088.5. "Significant new Information" includes information that changes an EIR "in a way that
25 deprives the public of meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse effect of
26 the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project
27| alternative) that the project's proponents have declined to implement." Ibid. Petitioner challenges
28 the County's determination that recirculation was not required.

14

55. The FEIR included significant new information related to (i) a new potentially
2 significant impact to a special-status bat species; (ii) a new significant and unavoidable impact
3 associated with off-site flooding; and (lii) new aspects of the Project climate change analysis, as
4 discussed above, including the new "project-specific Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan", none of

which was previously discussed in the DBIR. Accordingly, recirculation of the FEIR Was required
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5.
PRAYER FOR RELICF
Wherefore, Petitioner prays for the following relief:

9 1. That the Court issue a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary
10 and permanent injunctions enjoining the County and its agents, the Applicants and their agents,

11
r& Mitchali uLP and any working in concert with the County or the Applicants and their agents, from taking any

Mangels 12| action to implement any portion of the Project during the pendency of this litigation and pending
13 full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including CEQA.
13 CNETNL 14 2. That the Court issue a writ of mandamus setting aside the County's January 28,
15 2020 approval of the Project and certification of the FEIR and all other concurrently issued
16 approvals or land-use entitlements.
17 3. That the Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the County to comply with all
18 applicable laws and regulations, including CBQA, and take any other action as required by Public
19 Resources Code section 21168.9.

20 4. For a declaration that the County's approval of the Project and certification of the
21 FEIR and all other concurrently issued approvals or land-use entitlements violated CEQA are
22 invalid and of no force and effect.

23 5. For costs of the suit.

Applying for a Temporary Stay
In Traditional Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1085):
Step Action

Follow the statutory and regulatory provisions for obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO), an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be Issued (OSC), and/or a prellminary injunction, set forth in the Code of Clvll Procedure
(Inoluding but not limited to CCP §§ 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529) and rule 3.1150 of the Callfornia Rules of Court. These provisions constitute rules of practice for temporary stays In mandate proceedings brought under CCP § 1085 in the absence of temporary stay provisions specific to such mandate procéedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

2. When following the statutory and regulatory procedures for obtalning a TRO and/or an osc, comply with the ex parte procedures outlined above in "Applying for a Temporary Stay in Administrative Mandate Proceedings" and In rule 3.1201 et seq. of the California Rules-of Court.
Is If no TRO or ÖSC is sought, notice a motion for a preliminary injunction following the procedures set forth-below In "Bringing Motlons Before the Hearing on the Merits*

Note that a temporary stay in proceedings on a petition for a writ of prohibition may be obtained by following the procedures set forth below under "Setting a Hearing on the Merits of a Petition, (2) Securing issuande of alternative writ." An alternative writ of prohibition, untike an
alternative writ of mandate, stays specifled action by the respondent until further order of the
court, (See CCP $5 1087, 1104.)

Bringing Motions before The Hearing on the
Merits of a Writ Petition:

Motions on the pleadings and other pretrial matters brought in civil actions - Including
motións for chänge of venue, demurrers, motions to strike, motions to dismiss, discovery motions, and motions for summary judgrment - may generally be brought in writ proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

Gulde to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 5 of 11 5

Motions addressing the merits of the petition: in whole or in part should be calendared for hearing at the same time as the hearing on the merlts. Motions directed at resolving Issues preliminary to and distinct from the issues related to the merlts of the petition, such as untimeliness of the petition under an applicable statute of limitatione, should be calendared before the heafing on the morite of a writ petition. The court, in the exercise of ite discretion to conitrol the order of litigation before it, may advance the hearing on a motion to a date before the hatring on the merits or may postpone a motion to the hearing on the merlts when such advencement or postponement will promote the efficlent conduct and disposltion of the proceeding.

Because a writ petition ts usually disposed of by a hearing on the merits which is limited to oral
argument on written briefs and documentary evidence, the usefulness of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication in economically dlsposing of an unmeritorious
dase or clalm is substantlally reduced in writ proceedings. Thus, before bringing a motion for summary judgment or summary adudication, counsel should carefully evaluate whether the purpose of the motion can be achleved more directly and completely through a hearing on the merits of the petition.

Step Action

Contact the assigned wrlt department to reserve a date and time avallable on the department's calendar for a hearing on the motion. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other partles to the writ petition and determine their avallability on the date. Somé assigned writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

2, Nötice the motion in accordance with the civil law and motion procedures in
CCP S, 1005 and in compliance with the California Rules of Court, Inoluding rules
3.1110 through 3.1113, 3.1115, 3.1116, 3.1300, and 3.1320 through 3.1324.
Comply with the page limits for memoranda set forth in rule 3,1113.
If the assigned writ department uses the tentative rullrig system, the notlce of motion
must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

Setting a Hearing
on the Merits of a
Writ Petition:
If a hearing on the merlts of a writ petition has not been set in conjunotlon with an ex parte
hearing on an application for a temporary stay, It may be set elther by
(1) noticing a hearing on the petition or (2) securing issuance of an alternative writ. Note: The courf prefers, as more efficlent and economical for both itself and the partles, the procedure of notiding a hearing on the petitton.
The date set for a hearing on the merits of a writ petition, whether by notice or alternatlve writ, should allow the parties to flle briefs in accordance with the following schedule established
In Local Rule 2.26(D):
Opening brief: Due 45 days before the hearing
Opposition brief: Due 25 days before the hearing
Reply brlef: Due 15 day9 before the hearing
Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Ravised 1.1.2014 Page 6 of 11

:

Note that Local Rule 2.26(D) llimits the length of opening and opposition briéfs to 30 pages and reply brlefs to 20 pages instead of the page limits: In rule 3,1113 of the Callfornla Rules of Court.
The date of the hearing on the ments may be expedited and the brlefing schedule shortened upon an application setting forth circumstances warränting an expedited hearing. The application for an expedited hearing may be made orally at a hearing for a
temporary stay or alternative writ or on an ex parte basis in accordance with rule 3.1201 through 3.1206 of the Callfornia Rules of Court.

(1) Noticing a hearing on a writ petition

Step Action

If not prevlously served, the writ petition, the Notice of Assignment, and this Guide should aiso be served no later than the time for filling and serving the opening brlef.

(2) Securing Issuance of an alternative writ
The altemnative writ is an order to show cause that calendars a writ petition for a hearing on the merlts. With the exception of an alternative writ of prohibition issued pursuant to
CCP § 1104, the alternative in writ does not, in and of itself, accomplish a stay or afford any
affirmative relief.

Note that, with the Iternatlve writ method, two writs may be Issued in the proceeding. First, the alternative writ is Issued to set a hearing on the merits of the petition. Second, a peremptory writ may issue after the hearing on the merits.
Step Action d
