23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. This action challenges the October 20, 2020 approval of the Church of the Woods
25 Project ("Project" or "COTW Project") by Respondents County of San Bernardino and the
26 Board of Supervisors of the County of San Bernardino (collectively the "County"). The
27 County's approval of the Project violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
28 Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, title 15, California Code of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Regulations, section 15000 et seq., and the state Planning and Zoning Law.

2 2. The Project site spans a forested mountaintop and a portion of the headwaters of

3 Little Bear Creek, near the community of Rimforest. The site is currently a forested oasis, with

4 old-growth trees and riparian habitat supporting numerous rare and sensitive wildlife species.

5 Little Bear Creek originates at the southern edge of the site, flowing northeastward into Lake
6 Arrowhead. Scenic State Route 18 passes along the southern boundary of the site.

3. The Project would devastate this oasis. Ancient trees would be cut, the
8 mountaintop graded flat, and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of fill dumped across the

9 Little Bear Creek headwaters, including riparian areas. Habitat for sensitive wildlife would be
10 forever lost. Existing water quality in Little Bear Creek-and by extension, Lake Arrowhead-
11 might deteriorate even further. Grading across steep and unstable slopes would increase
12| landslide risks. Dangerous traffic hazards could increase along State Route 18. Wildfire risks-
13 and strains on already inadequate emergency evacuation routes-would likely get even worse.

14 4. CEQA requires County officials to be honest with themselves and the public about
15 impacts on the environment by preparing an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that fully
16 informs readers of environmental consequences and enables meaningful public participation.
17 CEQA also requires that significant environmental impacts revealed in the review process be
18 reduced or avoided to the fullest extent feasible.

19 5. Here, the County prepared an EIR that fell far short of CEQA's fundamental
20 standards. The EIR misleadingly attributed Project impacts to a County "Storm Drain" project
21 proposed for the same location, unlawfully green-lighted destruction of mitigation measures
22 previously adopted for the Storm Drain project, downplayed the significance of habitat loss and
23 wildlife impacts, and failed to provide adequate mitigation for harm to the rare and sensitive
24 species dependent on intact forests and streams. The EIR also ignored existing water quality
25 problems in Little Bear Creek, unlawfully deferred measures to address landslides and
26 geotechnical instabilities across the Project's steep hillsides, and tried to sweep significant
27 traffic hazards and wildfire evacuation difficulties under the rug.

28 6. In approving the Project, the County not only relied on a legally deficient EIR, but
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 also ignored the Project's numerous conflicts with its own General Plan, Lake Arrowhead
2 Community Plan, and Development Code, in violation of state Planning and Zoning Law.

3 7. In approving the Project, the County failed to proceed in the manner required by
4 law and failed to support its determinations with substantial evidence in the record. The County
5 prejudicially abused its discretion, and its approval of the Project must be set aside.

6 PARTIES

7 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff Save Our Forest Association, Inc. (*SOFA") is a 501(c)(3)
8 not-for-profit public benefit corporation. SOFA was formed in 1988 by ordinary citizens
9 outraged over the management of the public forest lands in the San Bernardino Mountains, and
10 the exchange of valuable forest open space out of public ownership into private hands. SOFA
11 monitors, comments on, and provides assistance to local residents and groups who have
12 concerns on any large development projects which affect the long term health and vitality of the
13 forest ecosystem in the San Bernardino Mountains. SOFA also supports local Chambers of
14 Commerce in enhancing the mountain community through sensible economic development,
15 tourism, and positive governmental relations. Members of SOFA are residents and taxpayers of
16 San Bernardino County who will be adversely affected by the Project's significant
17 environmental impacts. SOFA submitted written comments to the County objecting to and
18 commenting on the Project, the EIR, and related approvals.
19 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff Sierra Club is a national nonprofit organization with more
20 than 837,000 members nationwide, including 179,000 members in California, and
21 approximately 7,500 members in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The Sierra Club is
22 dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth; practicing and
23 promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; educating and enlisting
24| humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to using
25 all lawful means to carry out these objectives. The Sierra Club's concerns encompass climate
26 stabilization, coastal issues (including climate change-caused sea level rise), land use,
27 transportation, wildlife and habit preservation, and protection of parks and recreation. The
28 mission of the Sierra Club San Bernardino Mountains Group is to explore, enjoy, and protect the
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 natural and human environment of the San Bernardino Mountains. Members of Sierra Club are
2 residents and taxpayers of San Bernardino County who will be adversely affected by the
3 Project's significant environmental impacts. Sierra Club submitted written comments to the
4 County objecting to and commenting on the Project, the EIR, and related approvals.

5 10. Petitioner and Plaintiff San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society is a 501(c)(3)
6 not-for-profit public benefit corporation. Founded in 1948, San Bernardino Valley Audubon is
7 southeastern California's leading non-profit engaging people in the conservation of birds and
8 their habitats. Focusing on birds and other wildlife, San Bernardino Valley Audubon works to

9 conserve natural resources in the Southern California's "Inland Empire," including San
10 Bernardino County. San Bernardino Valley Audubon involves people through recreational
11 birding, envelops them in educational programs, and engages them in conservation actions from
12 counting birds to working with local, state, and national policy makers. San Bernardino Valley
13 Audubon strives to bring people to their natural environment. Members of San Bernardino
14 Valley Audubon are residents and taxpayers of San Bernardino County who will be adversely
15 affected by the Project's significant environmental impacts. San Bernardino Valley Audubon
16 submitted written comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the Project, the EIR,
17 and related approvals.

18 11. The interests that SOFA, Sierra Club, and San Bernardino Valley Audubon
19 Society (together, "Petitioners") seek to further in this action are within the goals and purposes
20 of these organizations. Petitioners and their members have a direct and beneficial interest in the
21 County's compliance with laws bearing on the Project. These interests will be directly and
22 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and which
23 would cause substantial harm to Petitioners' members, the natural environment, and the quality
24 of life in the surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will
25 confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public and the natural environment
26 from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.

27 12. Respondent County of San Bernardino ("County") is, and at all times herein
28 mentioned was, a political subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and
4

1 controlling land use within the County, including but not limited to implementing and
2 complying with the provisions of the State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan
3 and ordinances, and CEQA. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public
4 Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental
5 review of proposed actions. The County has a present legal duty to comply with CEQA and state

6 law.

7 13. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of San Bernardino is, and at all
8 times herein mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County. As
9 the decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors was charged with responsibilities under
10 CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and
11 granting the various approvals necessary for the Project. The Board also is and was responsible
12 for implementing and complying with the provisions of the State Planning and Zoning Law, the
13 County's General Plan and zoning ordinances. The Board has a present legal duty to comply
14 with CEQA and state law. The Board and its members are sued here in their official capacities.
15 14. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents
16 fictitiously named Does 1 through 20 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners
17 are informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief, allege the fictitiously
18 named respondents are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true
19 identities and capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this
20 petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
21 15. Real Party in Interest Church of the Woods ("COTW") is listed as the "Project
22 Applicant" on the County's October 21, 2020 Notice of Determination related to the Project.
23 COTW is named as a Real Party in Interest in this action pursuant to Public Resources Code
24 section 21167.6.5(a).
25 16. Petitioners are unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in Interest Does 21
26 through 40 and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and
27 believe, and based on such information and belief, allege that the fictitiously named real parties
28 in interest are directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the
5

14 STATEMENT OF FACTS

15 26. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
16 entirety.
17 I. The Church of the Woods Project Site

18 27. The Project site is a 27.12-acre undeveloped area in the Rim Forest Community of
19 unincorporated San Bernardino County. The site is located in the San Bernardino Mountains
20 within San Bernardino National Forest. The site occupies a prominent mountaintop location and
21 is characterized by steep hilly terrain covered in mature coniferous forest. The site is located
22 immediately adjacent to State Route 18 ("SR-18"), which is designated as a Scenic Byway by
23 the United States Forest Service ("USFS").

24 28. The site is bordered on the north by undeveloped mountainous terrain, on the west
25 by a neighborhood of single-family residences, on the south by SR-18 and undeveloped
26 mountainous terrain beyond SR-18, and on the east by Daley Canyon Road, beyond which lies a
27| public campground within San Bernardino National Forest. National Forest lands surround the
28 Project site on three sides.
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 29. The headwaters of Little Bear Creek run though the site, draining to the northeast
2 into a steep ravine. Little Bear Creek flows into Lake Arrowhead, a public drinking water
3 reservoir and regional recreational resource located 1.5 miles away. Current water quality data
4 show that levels of nutrients and bacteria in Little Bear Creck frequently exceed regulatory
5 standards. The southwestern portion of the site contains a stream and associated riparian habitat.

6 The stream is fed in part by an onsite natural spring. Because the stream has a surface
7 hydrological connection to Little Bear Creek and Lake Arrowhead, it is a state and federal
8 jurisdictional water regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE"), Lahontan

9 Regional Water Quality Control Board ("RWQCB") and California Department of Fish and
10 Wildlife ("CDFW"). The Project footprint contains both USACE and RWQCB jurisdictional
11 non-wetland waters as well as CDFW streambed and riparian habitat.

12 30. The site provides important habitat for numerous sensitive wildlife species,
13| including the Southern Rubber Boa ("SRB"), San Bernardino Flying Squirrel ("SBFS"), the
14 California Spotted Owl ("CSO"), Andrews' Marble Butterfly, Bald Eagle, Peregrine Falcon,
15 American Badger, Ringtail, and Yellow Warbler. The site is a critical link in a wildlife corridor
16 which provides for wildlife passage between habitat in the Mojave River Watersheds of Grass
17 Valley Creek and Deep Creek to the north and the watersheds of City Creek and Strawberry
18 Creek to the south.

19 31. The site is located in an area designated by CalFire as a "Very High Fire Hazard
20 Severity Zone," and lies within the County's Fire Hazard Overlay. SR-18 is the only viable
21 evacuation route from the site.

22 32. The County's Geologic Hazard Overlay Map indicates that the site is located in an
23 area of moderate to high landslide risk.

24 33. The site is located in the Lake Arrowhead Community Industrial zoning district.
25 II. The Storm Drain Project

26 34. The San Bernardino County Flood Control District purchased a 9.81-acre portion
27 of the land previously contained in the COTW Project site in order to develop the Rimforest
28 Storm Drain Project. The Storm Drain Project would involve construction on the 9.81-acre
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

X County-owned parcel, the southwestern portion of the COTW site, and on other properties south
2 of SR-18. For example, the Storm Drain Project would construct drainage infrastructure and
3 runoff detention basins along Little Bear Creek in ravine surrounded on three sides by the
4 remaining COTW property. The Storm Drain Project also would include construction of a
5 buried drainage culvert running through the COTW Project site and under SR-18.
O 35. The Storm Drain Project underwent CEQA review, and the County certified a
7 Final EIR on May 23, 2017. However, construction of the Storm Drain Project has not yet

8 begun. It remains unclear when the Storm Drain Project will be constructed, but the Storm Drain
9 Project must be built prior to the COTW Project as currently approved.
10 36. Impacts identified in the Storm Drain Project EIR include significant temporary
11 and permanent impacts on state and federal jurisdictional waters and wetlands, riparian habitat,

12 and sensitive wildlife species, including many species present on the COTW site. In addition to
13 the SRB, CSO and SBFS, the Storm Drain EIR concludes that the site offers suitable habitat for
14 the Andrews' Marble Butterfly, Bald Eagle, Peregrine Falcon, American Badger, Ringtail, and
15 Yellow Warbler, and that those species are likely present on the site.
16 37. The Storm Drain EIR proposes to mitigate these impacts on biological resources to
17 a level below significance via a variety of mitigation measures, including best management
18 practices during construction, surveys, monitoring, and avoidance measures for sensitive
19 species, restoration of temporarily impacted riparian areas, and compensation for permanent
20 habitat loss via habitat preservation.
21 38. Notably, the Storm Drain EIR identifies significant impacts to jurisdictional
22 waters and riparian habitat that currently exist on the portion of the site that would fall within
23 the COTW Project footprint, not only on the 9.81-acre County-owned site. The Storm Drain EIR
24  states that the project would temporarily impact jurisdictional waters and riparian habitat along
25 the stream on the COTW site, but proposes to mitigate those impacts by restoring the
26 temporarily impacted area following project completion.
27 III. The Church of the Woods Project

28 39. In 2003, Church of the Woods, the Project applicant, proposed construction of a
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 | large church campus and school on the Project site. The County Planning Commission approved
2 that project on May 20, 2004 without preparing an EIR. After the Planning Commission's
3 decision was appealed to the Board of Supervisors on May 28, 2004, the applicant agreed an
4 EIR was necessary and withdrew the proposal.
40. In 2010, the applicant resubmitted an application with a revised Project design that

6 removed the proposed school, but still sought to develop the site with thousands of square feet
7 of buildings, five and a half acres of playing fields and sports courts, and an amphitheater.

8 41. The County prepared and circulated a Draft EIR for the applicant's proposal in
9 2010 (see section IV infra). Community members voiced opposition to the proposal, expressing
10 concerns that the Project was out of scale with the surrounding community, and would have
11 resulted in significant fire hazards, traffic impacts, and impacts to sensitive biological habitat.
12 The County published a Final EIR in 2011, but after receiving extensive comments about the
13 Project, the applicant withdrew the application prior to final approval.

14 42. In April 2017, the applicant submitted the current proposal to the County, seeking
15 a Conditional Use Permit to construct a church campus and other facilities on the property
16 remaining after transfer of a portion of the site to the County for the Storm Drain Project. As
17 revised, the Project would convert 50 percent of the site to developed area, necessitating the
18 removal of all trees and vegetation. The Project would denude and then level the forested hilltop

19 in the southeastern portion of the site, and would fill the drainage in the southwestern portion of
20 the site with hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of soil. The Project would include
21 construction of almost 70,000 square feet of buildings on the eastern portion of the site,
22 including a 27,364 square foot gymnatorium and a 41,037 square foot church assembly building.
23 The Project would include 225,000 square feet of parking areas, driveways, walkways and
24 patios, with parking spaces for 311 cars. The central and southwestern parts of the site would
25 include approximately 64,000 square feet of sports fields and sports courts, constructed on the
26 filled area where Little Bear Creek originates. The Project would also include drainage features
27 and fuel modification zones extending into forested areas surrounding the Project. The Project
28 would include the widening of a 600-foot stretch of SR-18 by 26 feet and the construction of
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- new turn lanes, as well as installation of a traffic signal at the Project driveway's intersection
2 with SR-18 and at several other nearby intersections.

3 43. The Project would place fill on top of the stream and riparian area located in the
4 southwestern portion of the site, and then construct sports fields, driveways and parking areas on

5

6 top of that fill, permanently eliminating the stream and riparian habitat. As approved, the COTW
Project cannot proceed prior to completion of the Storm Drain Project, which would construct a
7 drainage pipe through the southwest part of the COTW site. The COTW Project's drainage

8 system would connect directly to the Storm Drain Project drain pipe. As described above, the
9 Storm Drain Project would temporarily impact jurisdictional waters and riparian habitat in the
10 portion of the site that the COTW Project would cover with fill, but also requires that the
11 temporarily impacted area be restored. The COTW Project would cover this restored area with
12 fill, sports fields, and parking, permanently eliminating the jurisdictional waters and riparian
13 habitat currently present on the site, along with the mitigation required by the Storm Drain
14 Project.
15 IV.

16 Environmental Review and Public Comments on the Church of the Woods Project
44. Throughout the administrative process leading up to the County's approval of the
17 Project, community groups, environmental organizations, and individuals, including Petitioners,
18 submitted voluminous comments objecting to the Project and identifying fundamental flaws in
19 the EIR.

20 A. The 2010 Draft EIR

21 45.

22 2010. A Draft EIR ("DEIR") for the applicant's 2010 proposal was published in April

23 46.

24 The 2010 DEIR included the following findings, among others:

a. The Project's impacts on jurisdictional waters and wetlands would be less
25 than significant after mitigation, relying on compliance with state and federal permitting
26 procedures as a mitigation measure.
27 b. The Project's impacts on the SRB would be cumulatively significant and
28 unavoidable, despite mitigation. SRB mitigation measures called for the replacement of lost
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

SRB habitat via onsite and offsite mitigation at 1 a ratio of 3 to 1 under a plan approved a by the
2 County, CDFW and USFS, and a required the Project to obtain a California Endangered Species
3 Act Incidental Take Permit ("ITP") from CDFW.

C. The Project's impacts on the SBFS would be cumulatively significant and
5 unavoidable, despite a mitigation measure calling for the Project to preserve suitable SBFS
6 habitat onsite where feasible.

7 d. The Project would pose landslide risks, but this impact would be less than
8 significant after mitigation, which would require County review of the grading plan for the site.

e. The Project would have significant impacts on traffic, because it would
10 exacerbate already deficient traffic conditions at several intersections, but proposed mitigation
11 measures requiring the applicant to contribute funds to the construction of traffic signals and
12 turn lanes at up to ten intersections would reduce these impacts below the level of significance.
13 f. The Project would have aesthetic impacts because removal of forest and
14 construction of Project buildings would permanently alter views along SR-18, and these impacts
15 would be significant and unavoidable despite mitigation measures requiring planting of trees and
16 landscaping to reduce visual impacts.

17 g. The Project would have significant and unavoidable impacts on land use,
18 because it would "conflict with General Plan and [Lake Arrowhead] Community Plan goals and
19 policies, provisions of the Open Space (OS) Overlay, and San Bernardino National Forest Land
20 Management Plan designed to preserve scenic views and rural character along Highway 18."
21 h. The Project would have less than significant impacts on wildfire risk,
22 emergency access and evacuation, roadway hazards, and water quality and hydrology, with no
23 need for mitigation.

24 B. Public Comments on the 2010 Draft EIR

25 47. The County received 100 comment letters on the 2010 DEIR for the Project. In a
26 September 22, 2010 comment letter, SOFA and Sierra Club outlined numerous ways in which
27 the DEIR failed to comply with CEQA, including but not limited to the following:

28 a. The DEIR's discussion of cumulative Project impacts on jurisdictional
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 waters and wetlands was inadequate, as it lacked evidence and analysis to support its

2 conclusions and did not consider the effects of other projects. The DEIR's conclusion that these
3 impacts would be less than significant improperly relied on the assertion that the impacted area
4 would be small in relation to the total quantity of jurisdictional waters within San Bernardino
National Forest.

6 b. The DEIR lacked adequate analysis of the Project's cumulative impacts to
sensitive wildlife species including the SRB and SBFS, as it failed to consider the effects of
other projects and did not propose feasible mitigation measures.

9 C. The DEIR lacked sufficient analysis of geological impacts such as
10 landslides, as it failed to calculate slope steepness on the site, and improperly deferred
11 mitigation (preparation of a Geological Hazards Report) until after Project approval.
12 d. The DEIR failed to adequately analyze wildfire hazards, as it did not
13 analyze the Project's compliance with regulatory requirements related to fire protection and did
14 not provide evidence in support of its conclusion that emergency evacuation and emergency
15 impacts would be less than significant.

16 e. The DEIR lacked an adequate project description, as it failed to describe the
17 structures that would be built onsite, which impeded an accurate evaluation of aesthetic impacts.
18 f. The DEIR failed to analyze the Project's inconsistencies with the San
19 Bernardino County General Plan, Lake Arrowhead Community Plan, and with the Development
20 Code's Fire Safety Overlay and Open Space Overlay.
21 48. In addition to these CEQA deficiencies, the comments noted that the Project's
22 inconsistencies with the County General Plan, Lake Arrowhead Community Plan, and
23 Development Code would violate California Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code §
24 65000 et seq.
25 49. The comments noted that the Project would conflict with the following
26 Development Code provisions:

27 a. Development Code sections 82.13.080(b)(3)(C), 82.13.080(D), and
28 83.08.040 (preserving sensitive natural terrain and natural drainage courses).
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

b. Development Code section 82.19.040 (Open Space Overlay).

C. Development Code sections 82.13.040 (1)(f); 82.13.060(b)(1); and

3 82.13.080 (Fire Safety Overlay).

d. Development Code section 82.15.010 (Geological Hazard Overlay).

e. Development Code chapter 88.01(Plant Protection and Management).

6 C. The 2011 Final EIR and Public Comments

50. The County released a FEIR for the Project in June 2011.

8 51. The FEIR concluded that none of the comments on the DEIR raised substantial
new information requiring additional review and recirculation of the EIR. However, the FEIR
10 added and revised several mitigation measures and made other changes.

11 52. On November 8, 2011, COTW and Sierra Club submitted a comment letter to the
12 County outlining deficiencies in the FEIR. Among other things, these comments noted that:
13 a. The EIR lacked an adequate description of the Project's environmental
14 setting. The discussion of the Project's hydrological setting must be updated to describe the
15 effects of the newly anticipated Storm Drain Project, and the EIR must consider the cumulative
16 hydrological effects of the two projects on Little Bear Creek.

17 b. The EIR's analysis of Project impacts to sensitive wildlife species including
18 the SRB and SBFS was inadequate, as it relied on outdated surveys, deferred full analysis until

19 after Project approval, and failed to identify specific mitigation measures. The EIR lacked
20 evidence for its conclusion that impacts on other sensitive species would be less than significant.
21 The EIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on the adjacent wildlife corridor,
22 denying that the Project would impede wildlife movement.

23 C. The EIR's analysis of impacts to jurisdictional waters and wetlands was
24| deficient, as it failed to adequately describe these resources. The EIR lacked support for its
25 conclusion that cumulative impacts to riparian areas, wetlands, jurisdictional waters would be
26 less than significant due to their abundance in the area. It improperly deferred development of
27 mitigation measures until after Project approval and incorrectly concluded that Project impacts
28 would be mitigated via compliance with permitting requirements.
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- d. The EIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's geological impacts, as it
2 did not calculate landslide risk and improperly deferred preparation of a Geologic Hazard
3 Report until after Project approval.

4 e. The EIR's analysis of wildfire hazards was deficient, as it failed to consider
5 the Project's location in a fire-prone area or the feasibility of emergency evacuation.

6 53. In addition to these CEQA deficiencies, the comments noted that the Project
7 would conflict with numerous policies of the County General Plan and Lake Arrowhead
8 Community Plan. For example, the Project would degrade Level of Service on area roadways,
9 conflicting with General Plan Policy M/CI 1.1, which states that "[t]he County shall ensure that
10 all new development proposals do not degrade Levels of Service (LOS) on State Routes and
11 Major Arterials below LOS C during non-peak hours or LOS D during peak hours in the
12 Mountain Region," and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan Policy LA.CI 1.1, which includes the
13 same requirement.

14 D. The 2019 Draft Revised EIR

15 54. On January 3, 2019, the County published a Draft Revised EIR ("DREIR") for the
16 Project. The DREIR updated the 2010 EIR to reflect changes in the Project proposal as well as
17 changed circumstances resulting from the County's purchase of a portion of the Project site for
18 the Storm Drain Project (see Part II supra).

19 55.

20 The DREIR included the following findings, among others:

a. The DREIR found that the Project would have less-than-significant impacts
21 on jurisdictional waters, wetlands, and riparian habitat after mitigation. The DREIR's proposed
22 mitigation measures called for the Project to obtain a Clean Water Act section 401 certification
23 from RWQCB, Clean Water Act section 404 permit from USACE, and CDFW regulatory
24 approval for streambed alteration.
25 b. The DREIR concluded that the Project would have significant impacts on
26 sensitive wildlife species including the SRB, SBFS and CSO, and that these impacts would
27 remain cumulatively considerable after mitigation. To mitigate these impacts, the DREIR called
28 for a preconstruction survey and monitoring for SRB, SBFS, and CSO, and preservation of 13.4
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

acres of the Project site via a conservation easement. The DREIR's evaluation of Project

2 impacts on other sensitive species differed notably from the Storm Drain EIR: unlike the Storm
3 Drain EIR, the DREIR concluded the Bald Eagle, American Badger, and Yellow Warbler were
4 unlikely to occur on the site, and the DREIR did not mention the Andrews' Marble Butterfly,
5 Peregrine Falcon, or Ringtail.

6 C. The DREIR concluded that the Project would require mitigation measures
7 to reduce geotechnical impacts such as landslides and lateral spreading to a less-than significant
8 level. Proposed mitigation measures required preparation of a design-level geotechnical
9 investigation and report that would recommend specific measures to reduce landslide risks,
10 lateral spreading, and other geotechnical impacts.

11 d. The DREIR concluded that the Project would have significant and
12 unavoidable traffic impacts even after mitigation, as Project-generated traffic would degrade the
13 Level of Service at several nearby intersections. Mitigation measures would require the Project
14 to install a traffic signal at the Project driveway's intersection with SR-18 and at two other

15 intersections.

16 e. The DREIR found that the Project would have significant and cumulatively
17 considerable impacts on land use because the degradation in Level of Service due to the
18 Project's traffic impacts would be inconsistent with San Bernardino General Plan Policy M/CI
19 1.1 and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan Policy LA.CI 1.1.

20 f. The DREIR found that the Project would have less-than-significant impacts

21 on emergency access, evacuation, roadway hazards, wildfire hazards, hydrology and water
22 quality, and aesthetics, with no need for mitigation.
23 E. Public Comments on the 2019 Draft Revised EIR

24 56. The County received 212 comments on the 2019 DREIR for the Project. In a
25 February 25, 2019 letter, SOFA and Sierra Club highlighted the DREIR's numerous
26 inadequacies, including but not limited to the following:

27 a. The DREIR's description of the Project setting failed to adequately
28 describe wildlife species and habitat present on the site, existing jurisdictional waters and
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 wetlands, and existing hydrologic conditions.

2 b. The DREIR failed to adequately analyze impacts to sensitive wildlife
3 including the SRB, CSO, SBFS, and Bald Eagle, as it failed to conduct protocol surveys for any

4 of these species and instead relied on outdated surveys. The proposed mitigation measures for
5 impacts to these special-status species were inadequate, as they improperly deferred

6 development of specific mitigation measures until after Project approval and incorrectly relied
7 on regulatory compliance to support a conclusion of less than significant impact. The EIR failed
8 to recognize the site's value a as a wildlife movement corridor.

9 C. The DREIR failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's traffic
10 impacts and did not adequately analyze the Project's impact on roadway hazards, failing to
11 consider how the Project driveway's intersection with SR-18 would cause dangerous driving
12 conditions and traffic accidents, especially during foggy and icy weather.
13 d. The DREIR lacked support for its conclusion that emergency evacuation
14 impacts would be less than significant, given limited evacuation capacity on SR-18 and the
15 cumulative effects of Project traffic and non-Project traffic.

16 e. The DREIR failed to adequately analyze wildfire risks, especially in light
17 of the Project's location in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, improperly relying on
18 asserted regulatory compliance and the use of fuel modification areas.

19 f. The DREIR's analysis of water quality, drainage and hydrology impacts
20 was inadequate, as it failed to accurately describe the existing stream and spring on the site,
21 consider the Project's effects on flow to those resources, or adequately consider the Project's
22 relationship to the Storm Drain project, which would also impact the stream and spring. Further,
23 the DREIR did not adequately analyze the hydrological effects of runoff from the Project's
24 impervious surfaces such as parking areas.
25 g. The DREIR's project description failed to describe or depict the appearance
26 of the Project's buildings, impeding analysis of aesthetic impacts.
27 57. SOFA and Sierra Club's comments also reiterated that the Project was
28 inconsistent with the County Development Code and County General Plan, thus violating the
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- State Planning and Zoning Law. The comments noted that the Project conflicted with the
2 Development Code's Fire Safety Overlay, and with General Plan Policy M/LU1.1 (limiting
3 development in sloping hillside areas), Policy M/LU1.6 (preserving the character of the
4 residential alpine environment), and Policies OS 7.5 and 7.6 (preservation of natural landforms
5 and ridgelines).

6 58. The comments also noted that the Project was inconsistent with Development
7 Code sections 82.13.080(b)(3)(C), 82.13.080(D), and 83.08.040 (protecting sensitive natural

8 terrain and natural drainage courses), Development Code section 88.01.090(b) (tree removal and
9 debris disposal), and with slope density location criteria for the Community Industrial District.

10 59.

11 In a February 25, 2019 letter, San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society

12 commented on the DREIR, noting the following deficiencies, among others:

a. The DREIR lacked support for its conclusion that aesthetic impacts would
13 be less than significant, and failed to adequately analyze the impact of clearcutting forest,
14 levelling hilltop, and constructing a large building complex on scenic resources along SR-18, a
15 scenic highway in a National Forest.

16 b. The DREIR's analysis of Project impacts to sensitive wildlife species was
17  inadequate. It relied on flawed SRB habitat surveys that did not follow CDFW survey protocols,
18 and mischaracterized SRB habitat on the site, when in fact the entire site should be considered
19 suitable and occupied SRB habitat. The DREIR's proposed mitigation of SRB habitat was
20 inadequate, as it failed to meet a 3 to habitat replacement ratio. The DREIR also improperly
21 understated the Project's impacts to the CSO and SBFS, and failed to include adequate
22 mitigation for impacts to those species. The DREIR lacked support for its assertion that the
23 Project would not impede wildlife movement along the County-designated Strawberry Creek
24 Wildlife Corridor.

25 C.

26 The DREIR's analysis of the Project's land use impacts was inadequate
because it failed to analyze the Project's inconsistency with General Plan policies M/LU1.2
27 (siting new development to be compatible with Forest Plan), LU 7.2 (limiting development in
28 environmentally sensitive areas, including riparian areas, and hazardous areas, including areas
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 with steep slopes or high fire risk), OS 7.5 and 7.6 (preservation of landforms and ridgelines),
2 M/OS-1 (preserve and properly manage National Forest Lands to maintain alpine character),
3 M/OS-2 (preserve open space corridors), and GP Policy M/CI 1.5 (avoid new traffic signals), as

4 well as Lake Arrowhead Community Plan policies LA/OS 4 (improve and preserve open space
5 corridors), LA/OS 4.2 (use open space corridors to link natural areas), and LA/CI 1.7 and LA/CI

6 1.13 (avoid new traffic signals).

7 F. The 2020 Final EIR

8 60. The Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Project was published on January 10, 2020.

9 61. The FEIR concluded that none of the comments on the DREIR raised substantial
10 new information requiring additional review and recirculation of the EIR.
11 62. The FEIR included responses to SOFA and Sierra Club's February 25, 2019
12 comment letter on the DREIR. Among other things, these responses defended the DREIR's
13 habitat assessment methods for analyzing Project impacts to the SRB, SBFS, and CSO, asserting
14 that protocol surveys are not required and that appropriate mitigation for these impacts may be
15 determined via CDFW's ITP process after Project approval. In response to SOFA and Sierra
16 Club's request that the EIR analyze the Project's potential to increase roadway hazards and
17 accidents, the responses asserted that the EIR need not include such analysis because "th[e]
18 comment provides no substantial evidence that the Project would compromise traffic safety,"
19 suggesting it is the public's responsibility to provide evidence of an impact. The FEIR did not
20 include any substantive response to SOFA and Sierra Club's comment that the Project is
21 | inconsistent with General Plan Policy M/LU1.1.

22 63. The FEIR's responses to comments also included responses to San Bernardino
23 Valley Audubon Society's February 25, 2019 letter. Among other things, these responses
24 asserted that Audubon's comments did not identify any deficiencies in the DREIR. The
25 responses further asserted that the DREIR's analysis of aesthetic impacts was adequate, that the
26 DREIR's analysis of impacts to and mitigation for special-status species was adequate, that the
27 Project would not impact the Strawberry Creek wildlife corridor, and that the Project would not
28 cause any significant conflicts with the General Plan or Lake Arrowhead Community Plan, with
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the exception of General Plan policy M/CI 1.1 and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan policy
2 LA/CI 1.1.

64. The Project as proposed in the FEIR was largely unchanged from that of the
DREIR. The FEIR made minor changes to the site plan, relocating a proposed
caretaker/maintenance outbuilding and calling for additional water quality Best Management

6 Practices for areas of the site draining towards SR-18.

7 65. The FEIR relied on the Storm Drain Project to assert that the COTW project.
8 would not have significant impacts on jurisdictional waters or wetlands. It asserted that the
9 Storm Drain Project would be completed first, before construction of the COTW Project, and
10 that all impacts to jurisdictional waters and wetlands would be caused by the Storm Drain
11 Project, not the COTW Project. The FEIR deleted a mitigation measure contained in the DREIR

12 which would have required the Project to obtain a Clean Water Act section 404 permit from
13 USACE, section 401 permit from RWQCB, and a section 1602 streambed alteration agreement
14 from CDFW. The FEIR claimed these measures would be unnecessary because the Storm Drain
15 Project would eliminate the jurisdictional waters on the site, SO the COTW Project would have

16 no impact on these waters or riparian habitat.

17 G. Public Comments on the 2020 Final EIR

18 66. On January 22, 2020, SOFA and Sierra Club submitted comments to the Planning

19 Commission explaining that the FEIR did not adequately respond to previous comments or cure
20 the DREIR's legal inadequacies. SOFA's and Sierra Club's comments identified deficiencies in
21 the FEIR, including but not limited to the following:
22 a. The FEIR's project description failed to adequately describe the Project's
23 relationship to the Storm Drain Project. The EIR failed to acknowledge that the Project's
24| drainage systems would depend on connections to drainage infrastructure installed as part of the

25 Storm Drain Project.

26 b. The FEIR's analysis of impacts to jurisdictional waters, wetlands and

27 riparian areas remained inadequate. The FEIR failed to adequately describe the stream, spring
28 and wetlands on the COTW site, making accurate impact analysis impossible.
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 C. The FEIR provided no support for its assertion that the COTW Project
2 would not have any impacts to jurisdictional waters and wetlands because they would have

3 already been impacted and mitigated by the Storm Drain Project. Even if the Storm Drain
4 Project were completed first, not all jurisdictional waters on the COTW site would be eliminated
5 by the Storm Drain Project. Rather, as part of mitigation required under the Storm Drain Project,
6 temporarily impacted areas (including jurisdictional waters and riparian habitat) would be

7 restored after completion of the Storm Drain Project. These same restored areas would
8 subsequently be destroyed by the COTW Project, which would dump fill in those areas to
9 construct sports fields, driveways and parking.

10 d. The FEIR's deletion of Mitigation Measure 3C-2(c)) (which would have
11 required the applicant to obtain Clean Water Act section 404 and section 401 regulatory
12 approvals and a CDFW streambed alteration permit prior to issuance of a grading permit ) left
13 the Project's significant impacts on jurisdictional waters and wetlands unmitigated.
14 e. The EIR lacked support for its conclusion that cumulative impacts to
15 jurisdictional waters and wetlands would be less than significant due to their abundance in the
16 area, and incorrectly claimed that these impacts would be mitigated via compliance with
17 permitting requirements.

18 f. The FEIR's analysis of impacts to sensitive wildlife species remained
19 inadequate. The FEIR understated the severity of the Project's impacts to the SRB, SBFS, and
20 CSO. It failed to conduct protocol-level surveys for these species, and underestimated the
21 quality and extent of those species' habitat on the site, wrongly characterizing areas of the site as
22 low or moderate-quality habitat when in fact the entire site constitutes highly suitable habitat
23 that is likely occupied by these species.
24 g. The FEIR's mitigation measures for wildlife impacts remained inadequate.
25 The FEIR's proposed preservation of 13.4 acres of the site as wildlife habitat was not sufficient
26 mitigation for the destruction of habitat on the remainder of the site, and fell far short of the
27 recommended 3 to 1 ratio for mitigation of habitat loss. The FEIR also failed to acknowledge
28 the Project's impacts on the north-south wildlife movement corridor.
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

h. The FEIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's geotechnical impacts,

2 despite the site's susceptibility to landslides and lateral spreading, and improperly deferred

3 investigation of these impacts until after Project approval.

i. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's traffic impacts remained inadequate,
failing to consider the Project's cumulative effects on roadway congestion together with other
6 developments. The proposed traffic mitigation measures were deficient because they failed to
ensure that necessary infrastructure upgrades be installed at six intersections impacted by the

8 Project. The FEIR failed to provide support for its conclusion that the Project would not impact

9 roadway hazards, improperly claiming that it was not required to analyze the risk of traffic
10 accidents because the public had failed to provide substantial evidence of such risks.

11 j. The FEIR's analysis of Project impacts on water quality, drainage and
12 hydrology remained inadequate, as the FEIR failed to consider how the Project's increase in

13 impervious surfaces could affect runoff and associated impacts on Little Bear Creek and Lake
14 Arrowhead. The FEIR failed to accurately describe baseline surface and groundwater
15 conditions, and did not disclose or address existing water quality impairment in Little Bear

16 Creek. The FEIR improperly relied on regulatory compliance, design features and generic Best
17 Management Practices to conclude that drainage and water quality impacts would be less than
18 significant, but provided no evidence that these measures would be effective.

19 k. The FEIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's aesthetic impacts on
20 scenic resources, including the Project's visual impacts on SR-18, a designated scenic highway.
21 The Project description did not include sufficient information about the Project's design and
22 appearance, as it lacked visual depictions of the proposed buildings.

23 1. The FEIR did not cure the DREIR's deficient analysis of the Project's
24 impacts on wildfire risk. It lacked support for its conclusion that the Project's emergency
25 evacuation impacts would be less than significant, as it failed to analyze how Project-generated
26 traffic could impede wildfire evacuation on SR-18.

27 67. In addition to these CEQA deficiencies, SOFA and Sierra Club's January 22
28 comments reiterated that the Project was inconsistent with the County Development Code, San
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Bernardino County General Plan and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan and would therefore
2 violate the California Planning and Zoning Law. These comments noted that the Project would
conflict with numerous General Plan Policies, including:

4 a. GP Policy M/CI 1.1 and Lake Arrowhead Plan Policy LA/CI 1.1 (calling
5 for maintenance of specified Levels of Service on area roadways).

6 b. GP Policy CI 4.6 (requiring project applicant to pay
7 traffic mitigation costs) fair share of offsite

8 S. LA/OS 4 (preserving open space corridors in the Lake Arrowhead area).

t. LA/OS 4.2 (linking natural areas via open space corridors in the Lake
10 Arrowhead Plan area).

11 H. Planning Commission Approval of the Project

12 68. On January 23, 2020, the County Planning Commission approved the Conditional
13 Use Permit (P201700270) for the Project, certified the FEIR, and adopted CEQA Findings and
14 Statements of Overriding Consideration, a Mitigation Monitoring Reporting Program, and
15 Conditions of Approval. The Commission concluded in its Statement of Overriding
16 Considerations that "the significant unavoidable adverse [P]roject impacts related to cumulative
17 biological resources, construction noise transportation and traffic, and land use are acceptable
18 and are outweighed by specific social, economic and other benefits of the [P]roject," including
19 the applicant's need for an expanded church facility and community gathering space.

20 I. Petitioners' Appeal to the Board of Supervisors

21 69. On January 30, 2020, SOFA, Sierra Club, and San Bernardino Valley Audubon
22 Society appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the County Board of Supervisors. The
23 appeal application summarized and incorporated by reference comments and objections raised in
24 prior letters on the Project.

25 70. On October 8, 2020, SOFA and Sierra Club submitted comments to the Board of
26 Supervisors again outlining the EIR's inadequacies and requesting that the Board deny approval
27 of the Project. These comments elaborated further on the EIR's deficiencies, including but not
28 limited to the following:
24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 a. As explained in previous comment letters, the FEIR failed to adequately
2 describe the Project's relationship with the Storm Drain Project and the cumulative effects of the
3 two projects.

4 b. The EIR's analysis of impacts to jurisdictional waters and wetlands
5 remained inadequate. It incorrectly assumed that all impacts to jurisdictional waters and riparian
6 habitat within the COTW Project development footprint would be eliminated or mitigated by the
7 County's Storm Drain Project, ignoring the fact that the COTW Project would destroy areas that
8 would be temporarily impacted but subsequently restored by the Storm Drain Project. The
9 COTW EIR deleted a mitigation measure that was intended to address these impacts. The EIR
10 failed to acknowledge the stream and spring on the site, underestimated impacts to riparian
11 habitat, and lacked support for its conclusion that cumulative impacts to jurisdictional waters
12 would be less than significant.

13 C. The EIR lacked adequate analysis of impacts to the SRB, inaccurately
14 characterized SRB habitat on the site, and provided no evidence that the proposed SRB
15 mitigation measures would be effective. In particular, mitigation measures requiring
16 preservation of part of the COTW site did not replace or offset the loss of habitat on the
17 remainder of the site. The EIR failed to provide any cumulative impact analysis for the SRB,
18 SBFS, and CSO.

19 d. The EIR did not evaluate Project impacts on other sensitive wildlife species
20 that the Storm Drain EIR concluded were likely present on the site, such as the Andrews'
21 Marble Butterfly, Bald Eagle, Peregrine Falcon, American Badger, Ringtail, and Yellow
22 Warbler. Despite the fact that the COTW Project site occupies nearly the same location and
23 includes identical habitat, the COTW EIR concluded the Bald Eagle, American Badger, and
24 Yellow Warbler were unlikely to occur on the site, and entirely ignored the Marble Butterfly,
25 Peregrine Falcon, and Ringtail. The Storm Drain EIR found that impacts on some of these
26 species would be significant absent mitigation.
27 e. The EIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on water quality
28 in Little Bear Creek and Lake Arrowhead, and did not accurately disclose existing water quality
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impairment in both the creek and the lake, including nutrient and bacteria levels that frequently

2 exceed regulatory standards. The EIR failed to analyze how Project construction and operation

3 could affect runoff and associated water quality impacts on Little Bear Creek and Lake
Arrowhead. The EIR improperly relied on regulatory compliance, design features and generic
Best Management Practices to conclude that water quality impacts would be less than
significant, without showing that these measures would be effective.
f. The EIR lacked support for its conclusion that the Project would not impair
emergency evacuation. The Project would cause significant and unavoidable traffic impacts at
9 numerous intersections that could impede evacuation and prevent emergency responders from
10 accessing the site. The EIR also failed to analyze the evacuation capacity of SR-18 and other
11 area roadways in the event of a wildfire.

12 g. The EIR did not include adequate analysis in support of its conclusion that
13 the Project would not increase roadway hazards, especially near the Project driveway's
14 intersection with SR-18, despite expert evidence in the record showing the Project would
15 exacerbate these hazards. The EIR did not analyze the Project's potential to increase traffic
16 accidents and ignored the effect of icy, foggy, or snowy conditions. The Project driveway's
17 intersection with SR-18 did not include adequate stopping sight distance for drivers based on the
18 highway's design speed. The EIR did not consider the effect of queued vehicles on roadway

19 safety hazards.

20 71. In addition to these CEQA deficiencies, the comments also reiterated that the
21 Project would violate the State Planning and Zoning Law due to its numerous inconsistencies
22 with General Plan and Community Plan policies. Most notably, the comments reiterated that the
23 Project would cause several intersections to operate at LOS E or F, thus conflicting with General
24 Plan Policy M/CI 1.1 and Community Plan Policy LA/CI 1.1, which require the County to
25 ensure that all new development proposals do not degrade LOS on state routes and major
26 arterials below LOS C during non-peak hours or below LOS D during peak hours in the
27 Mountain Region.

28 72. On October 16, 2020, the County released responses (dated September 29, 2020)
26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to the public comments received on the FEIR that were submitted to the Planning Commission

2 in January (the "October 16, 2020 responses"). These included responses to SOFA and Sierra
3 Club's January 22, 2020 letter.
73. These responses again asserted that the Storm Drain Project would be completed

5 before COTW Project construction, and that the COTW Project would have no impact on
6 jurisdictional waters or wetlands because the Storm Drain Project would permanently eliminate
7 them. In addition, the responses claimed for the first time that the County did not intend to
8 restore any jurisdictional waters or wetlands impacted by the Storm Drain project,
9 notwithstanding the required mitigation measures in the Storm Drain EIR.

10 74. Together with its responses, the County issued revised Conditions of Approval
11 ("COAs") for the Project. Condition of Approval No. 37 stated that if the COTW Project were to
12 be substantially revised such that its drainage system did not connect to the Storm Drain Project,
13 such revisions would require subsequent County approval and additional review under CEQA.
14 75. The County's October 16, 2020 responses asserted that impacts to the SRB, CSO
15 and SBFS would be mitigated through the issuance of an ITP by CDFW.
16 76. In its October 16, 2020 responses, the County for the first time released an
17| architectural rendering showing part of one elevation of the proposed assembly building on the
18 site. The responses did not include renderings of the building's other elevations, or of other
19 structures on the site.

20 77. On October 19, SOFA and Sierra Club submitted additional comments to the
21 Board of Supervisors addressing deficiencies in the County's October 16 responses to
22 comments. Among other things, SOFA and Sierra Club noted in their comments that:
23 a. The County's responses regarding Project impacts on aquatic resources
24 were inaccurate and did not resolve the EIR's deficiencies. The EIR's shifting analysis of the
25 Project's relationship to the Storm Drain Project failed to show that impacts to jurisdictional
26 waters, wetlands, and riparian habitats would be less than significant. Even if the Storm Drain
27 Project were completed first, the COTW Project would have impacts on jurisdictional waters
28 and riparian habitat which would remain unanalyzed and unmitigated. The County's responses
27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F failed to acknowledge that the vast majority of the Storm Drain Project's impacts to
2 jurisdictional waters and riparian habitat would be temporary, not permanent, and thus subject to
3 restoration under mitigation measures adopted in the Storm Drain EIR. The assertion in the
4 responses that the County did not intend to restore any jurisdictional waters effectively deleted a
5 mitigation measure adopted in the Storm Drain EIR without any analysis or substantial
6 evidentiary support.

7 b. The County's responses did not cure the EIR's failure to describe the
8 Project's impacts to water flow in the spring and stream on the site. As with jurisdictional
9 waters, the EIR improperly sought to avoid analyzing impacts to these flows by claiming that
10 the Storm Drain Project would mitigate or eliminate any impacts.

11 C. The County's responses incorrectly asserted that impacts to the SRB,
12 SBFS and CSO would be mitigated by issuance of an ITP from CDFW, but the EIR did not
13 require the Project to obtain an ITP. The EIR also improperly deferred mitigation for the Project.
14 The EIR further lacked support for its conclusion that preclearance surveys and habitat
15 preservation would mitigate wildlife impacts to a less than a significant level. The County's
16 responses also did not resolve the EIR's inadequate analysis of wildlife corridor impacts or
17 cumulative impacts on wildlife.
18 d. The County's responses did not remedy the EIR's inadequate analysis of
19 traffic congestion generated by the Project, which would conflict with General Plan and Lake
20 Arrowhead Community Plan policies requiring maintenance of specific LOS on area roadways,
21 as explained in prior comments. The County's responses did not remedy the EIR's deficient
22 analysis of the Project's impacts on water quality or its insufficient mitigation for those impacts.
23 The County failed to address recent data showing that nutrient and bacteria levels in Little Bear
24 Creek frequently exceed regulatory standards. The EIR improperly deferred mitigation of
25  construction impacts on water quality until after Project approval, pending development of a
26 storm water pollution prevention plan and compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge
27 Elimination System ("NPDES") permit.

28 e. The County's last-minute publication of a single architectural rendering
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 showing one side of the building did not cure the EIR's inadequate description of the Project or
2 its inadequate analysis of aesthetic impacts.

3 78. On October 19, 2020, San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society submitted a letter
4 to the Board of Supervisors noting the following deficiencies in the FEIR and the Project,
5 among others:

6 a. The FEIR's analysis of the Project's aesthetic impacts remained inadequate,

7 as it failed to recognize the aesthetic value of the site's natural features and improperly ignored
8 the visual impacts of clearcutting forest, levelling a hilltop, and constructing a large building
9 complex on SR-18, a scenic highway in a National Forest.

10 b. The FEIR's analysis of Project impacts on the SRB and CSO remained
11 inadequate. The County failed to conduct protocol surveys for the SRB and instead used
12 inaccurate survey methods that could not have detected the species. The FEIR's characterization
13 of "low-quality" wildlife habitat was inaccurate, and the proposed habitat conservation
14 mitigation measure would not preserve enough acres of habitat. The County failed to adequately
15 consult with CDFW and USFS regarding these impacts.

16 C. The Project violated several policies of the General Plan and Lake
17 Arrowhead Community Plan.

18 d. The County's proposed Statement of Overriding Considerations did not
19 contain adequate justification to approve the Project. The purported Project benefits described in
20 the statement would be primarily private benefits for the members of the applicant's church, and
21 would not benefit the broader community, while the Project's negative impacts on aesthetics,
22 scenic values, biological resources, and land use would all adversely affect the public.
23 79. Also on October 19, the County published responses to SOFA and Sierra Club's
24 October 8 comments. Among other things, the County's responses reiterated that the Storm
25 Drain Project would be implemented prior to the COTW Project, that the County did not intend
26 to restore riparian habitat or jurisdictional waters in areas impacted by the Storm Drain Project,
27 and that the COTW Project would have no impact on jurisdictional waters or wetlands because
28 the Storm Drain Project would eliminate those resources.
29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

80. The responses reiterated that Project impacts to the SRB, SBFS, and CSO would
2 be mitigated via an ITP issued by CDFW after Project approval, and stated that the actual
3 acreage of habitat conservation required as mitigation would be determined by the CDFW.
4 during the processing of the ITP. The County's October 19 responses asserted that the EIR was
5 not required to analyze the Project's impacts on the Andrews' Marble Butterfly, Bald Eagle,

6 Peregrine Falcon, American Badger, Ringtail, and Yellow Warbler, because riparian habitat on
7 the COTW site would be impacted and mitigated by the Storm Drain Project and not by the

8 COTW Project. These responses inaccurately assumed that these species are purely riparian,
9 when in fact they could occur elsewhere on the COTW site, in areas not impacted by the Storm
10 Drain Project.

11 81. In response to SOFA and Sierra Club's assertion that the Project driveway's
12 intersection with SR-18 did not include adequate sight distance for drivers based on the
13 highway's design speed, the County's responses stated that the FEIR had erroneously calculated
14 the sight distance along SR-18 at the intersection with the Project driveway. The responses

15 asserted that due to the widening of SR-18, the actual sight distance would be over 600 feet in
16 each direction, not 300 feet in each direction as stated in the FEIR. The responses included a
17 map that failed to provide meaningful detail or evidence sufficient to support this assertion.

18 V. Final Approval of the Project

19 82. The Board of Supervisors heard the appeal of the Planning Commission's
20 approval of the Project on October 20, 2020. SOFA, Sierra Club, and San Bernardino Valley
21 Audubon Society appeared at the hearing through counsel by teleconference and presented
22 further comments, including a PowerPoint presentation, addressing the insufficiency of the
23 FEIR and the County's responses to comments. At the close of the hearing, the Board of
24 Supervisors voted to deny the appeal, certify the FEIR, adopt CEQA Findings of Fact and
25 Statement of Overriding Considerations, adopt a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program,
26 adopt Findings for approval of the Conditional Use Permit, and approve the Conditional Use
27 Permit for the Project, subject to the recommended Conditions of Approval.
28 83. The County filed and posted a CEQA Notice of Determination concerning the
30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Project on October 21, 2020.

2

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of CEQA

4

5 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seg.; State & County CEQA Guidelines)

84.

6 entirety. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

7 85. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
8 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
9 including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant
10 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
11 decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
12 proposed project. Additionally, the EIR must identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or
13 avoid the project's significant environmental impacts, as well as analyze a reasonable range of
14 alternatives to the project.

15 86. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures
16 that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the
17 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars
18 the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the
19 project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.
20 87. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would have
21 significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
22 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

23 88. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must
24 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and
25 CEQA further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
26 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
27 89. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
28| by certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and
31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the CEQA Guidelines. The inadequacies in the County's analysis include, but are not limited to,
2 failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the following impacts:

3 a. Jurisdictional waters

4 b. Riparian habitat

5 C. Biological resources

6 d. Geotechnical impacts
7 e. Hydrology and water quality

8 f. Land use

9 g. Traffic and transportation
10 h. Wildland fire risks

11 i. Emergency evacuation

12 j. Aesthetics

13 90. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
14 by certifying an EIR that fails to provide a complete, accurate, stable, and consistent description
15 of the Project.
16 91. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
17 by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately describe the environmental setting of the Project
18 and the baseline for environmental analysis.

19 92. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
20 by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately consider the cumulative impacts of the Project.
21 93. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
22 by failing to consider Project alternatives that would have reduced significant impacts while still
23 meeting project objectives. Similarly, Respondents violated CEQA by adopting overly narrow
24 Project objectives.

25 94. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
26 by certifying an EIR that inaccurately and misleadingly attributes Project impacts to the Storm
27 Drain Project, contradicts the Storm Drain Project EIR, destroys and eliminates mitigation
28 required by the County in connection with the Storm Drain Project without analysis or
32
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

substantial evidentiary support, and fails to identify adequate and feasible mitigation for the

2 Project's impacts.

95. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
4 by failing to recirculate the EIR despite substantial changes to the Project and the circumstances
5 under which it is undertaken, and despite significant new information added to the EIR after the

6 draft EIR was made available for public review but prior to certification.

7 96. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter
8 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

97. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting a statement of overriding considerations
10 that is inadequate as a matter of law in that it is not supported by substantial evidence in the
11 record.

12 98. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
13 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by certifying an EIR, making
14 findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As
15 such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Laws

18 (Gov. Code §8 65300 et seq.)

19 99. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
20 entirety.

21 100. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to
22 adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan serves as a
23 charter for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform. DeVita v.
24 County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773.
25 101. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth "should be
26 guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan."
27 102. Government Code section 65860 requires that zoning be consistent with the
28 general plan. Courts have held that other land use decisions must also be consistent with the
33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

general plan. Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806.
State Planning and Zoning Law requires compliance with all General Plan policies that are
"fundamental, mandatory, and specific." Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County v.
Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1342; Spring Valley Lake Assn V. City of
Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 100-101.
103. The County violated the requirements of state law by approving a project that is
inconsistent with the requirements of the County's General Plan and the Lake Arrowhead

8 Community Plan. For example, and as described above, the Project is inconsistent with:

a. General Plan Policy M/CI 1.1 and Lake Arrowhead Plan Policy LA/CI 1.1.

10 These policies, which require the County to maintain specific levels of service on area
11 roadways, are fundamental, mandatory, specific, and clear. The EIR acknowledges that the
12 Project would conflict with these policies. The County cannot rationally find the Project
13 consistent with the General Plan and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan in light of the Project's
14 clear conflict with these policies.

15 b. Core General Plan and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan policies and
16 principles that among other things require the County to: ensure that applicants pay their fair
17 share of necessary improvements; control development to ensure adequate infrastructure; limit
18 development in steeply sloped hillside areas, riparian areas, and other environmentally sensitive
19 areas; site new development in a manner compatible with the San Bernardino National Forest
20 Plan; consult with the United States Forest Service and coordinate with state and federal

21 agencies to protect areas of special habitat value; preserve rural communities and character,
22 including mountain character and natural resources; protect unique habitats supporting rare and
23 endangered species; maintain and enhance biological diversity and healthy ecosystems; maintain
24 and enhance the visual character of scenic routes; preserve landforms and ridgelines; preserve

25 open space corridors and use them to link natural areas; avoid new traffic signals; and preserve
26 unique features of Lake Arrowhead. These policies and principles include, but are not limited to:
27 General Plan policies CI 4.6, CI 9.1, M/LU1.1, M/LU1.2, M/LU1.4, M/LU1.6, M/LU1.20, CO
28 1.2, CO 1.4, CO 1.7, CO 2, CO 2.1, LU 7.2, OS 5, OS 5.3, OS 7.5, OS 7.6, M/CI 1.5, M/CO 1.4,
34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 M/OS-1, and M/OS-2, and Lake Arrowhead Community Plan policies LA/CI 1.7, LA/CI 1.13,
2 LA/CO 1, LA/OS 4, and LA/OS 4.2.

3 104. State law also requires that permits and other land use decisions also be consistent

4 with the applicable zoning ordinance. Land Waste Management v. Contra Costa County Bd. of
5 Supervisors (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 950, 957-59.

6 105. The County violated the requirements of state law by approving a project that is
7 inconsistent with the requirements of the San Bernardino County Development Code. For

8 example, and as described above, the Project is inconsistent with Development Code provisions

9 and requirements addressing sensitive natural terrain and natural drainage courses; tree removal

10 and debris disposal; slope density location criteria; fire safety overlay requirements; geological
11 hazard overlay requirements; and plant protection and management requirements. These
12 provisions and requirements include, but are not limited to: Development Code sections
13 82.13.080(b)(3)(C), 82.13.080(D), 83.08.040, 88.01.090(b), 82.13.040 (1)(f), 82.13.060(b)(1),
14 82.13.080, 82.15.010, and chapter 88.01.

15 106. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
16 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project, making
17 findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the County's General Plan and Lake
18 Arrowhead Community Plan, the County's Development Code, and State Planning and Zoning
19 Law. As such, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.
20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
22 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and
23 set aside its certification of the EIR, approval of the Conditional Use Permit, adoption of
24 findings and statement of overriding considerations, and all other related Project approvals;

25 2. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with
26 the requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan and
27 Lake Arrowhead Community Plan, and the County's Development Code, and to take any other
28 action as required by Public Resources Code Section 21168.9;
35
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
injunctions restraining the County and Real Party in Interest and their agents, servants, and
employees, and all others acting in concert with the County on their behalf, from taking any
action to implement the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the
CEQA Guidelines, State law, and the County Code;

6 4. For costs of the suit;

7 5. For an order awarding Petitioner its attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure

8 section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and

6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
