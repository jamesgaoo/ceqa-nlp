PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 1

1 INTRODUCTION

2
1.
3 In this action, Petitioner and Plaintiff Albert Thomas Paulek (Paulek) challenge the September 22, 2020 California Fish and Game Commission Approval/Authorization of
4 "conditional take" of western Joshua tree on 15 solar energy projects located in the
5 California desert in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
6 Respondent Fish and Game Commission (FGC) abused their discretion in authorizing

7 the "conditional take" of the western Joshua tree and failed to proceed as required by

8 law.

9

2. 10 On October 21, 2019 the FGC received a petition from the Center for Biological

11 Diversity (CBD) to list the western Joshua tree as a threatened species under the
California Endangered Species Act (CESA). On November 1, 2019 the FGC staff 12 transmitted the petition to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) for
13 review. A notice of receipt of the petition was published in the California Regulatory
14 Notice Register on November 22, 2019.

15

16 3. California Fish and Game Code Section 2073.5 requires the DFW evaluate the CBD

17 petition and submit a written evaluation with a recommendation to FGC, which was

18 received at the FGC April 2020 meeting. The DFW evaluation report delineates each of

19 the categories of information required for a petition, evaluates the sufficiency of the

20 available scientific information for each of the required components, and incorporates
additional relevant information that DFW possessed or received during the review 21 period. Based upon the information contained in the petition and other relevant
22 information, DFW determined there was sufficient scientific information available to
23 indicate that the petitioned action by the FGC may be warranted.
24

25 4. The FGC scheduled the public hearing on the petition for its June 2020 meeting

26 following the public release and required 30-day review period for the DFW evaluation

27 report, as required by Fish and Game Code section 2074 and 2074.2. If the FGC

28 determines listing may be warranted pursuant to section 2074.2, western Joshua tree
will become a candidate species and the DFW will undertake a one-year status

N

c g review before the FGC can make final decision on the listing. Candidate species
are protected under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) pursuant to section
2085 during the remainder of the CESA listing process.

G1 5.

7 At the June 2020 meeting, The FGC took public comment and continued the public

8 hearing to its August 19-20, 2020 meeting. At the August 2020 meeting, the FGC took

6E:. public comment and received presentations from DFW, the CBD petitioner, and several
other organizations. After oral testimony concluded, the FGC discussed the item, closed

6. the public hearing and administrative record pursuant to Fish and Game Code 2074.2,
and continued FGC deliberations to the September 22, 2020 public meeting.

13 The FGC at its September 22, 2020 public meeting considered two agenda action

14 items. Agenda Item #3, in a unanimous 4-0 vote, the FGC determined that listing the

15 western Joshua tree as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered

16 Species Act (CESA) may be warranted. The FGC vote commences the one-year DFW
status review for the western Joshua tree. The FGC will make the final decision on the

17 endangered species listing following the one-year status review. During the status

18 review, the western Joshua tree is protected under CESA as a candidate species.

19 Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the now candidate western

20 Joshua tree shall nevertheless be considered to be endangered, rare or threatened
pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 1538o(d).

21 7.

22 On agenda item #4, the subject of this lawsuit, the FGC voted 3-1 to

23

24 authorize/approve the emergency "conditional take" of western Joshua trees

25 during its candidacy on 15 Solar energy projects located in the California desert and
expected to break ground within the year. The FGC rationale for the emergency

26 rulemaking, under the California Administrative Procedures Act, being that Climate

27 change impacts pose a clear threat to public health in California and are proving to be a

28 8. primary threat to the survivability of the western Joshua tree.

The FGC further asserts the emergency rulemaking is necessary to help keep the
state on track to meet its renewable energy goals while protecting biodiversity. In

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 3

1 approving the emergency "conditional take" of candidate western Joshua trees on 15

2 Solar projects in the California desert the FGC violated the substantive mandates of the

3 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Petitioner accordingly request this Courtl issue a writ of mandate under Cal. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5 directing
4 Respondent FGC to vacate and set aside the September 22, 2020 Approval of the
5 emergency "conditional take" of western Joshua trees until the FGC fully complies with
6 CEQA.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9

10 9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085, 1094-5, 187,

11 and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the
Public Resources Code.
12

13 10. Venue for this action properly lies in Riverside County Superior Court because
14 Respondent California Fish and Game Commission regulates wildlife resources and

15 conducts business in all the counties of California including Riverside County. The

16 California Attorney General maintains an office in Riverside County.

17

18 THE PARTIES

19
11. Petitioner/Plaintiff ALBERT THOMAS PAULEK (Paulek) is a retired (28.5 years) 20 Department of Fish and Wildlife Associate Wildlife Biologist. Paulek is a Certified
21 Wildlife Biologist [The Wildlife Society] having extensive knowledge and experience
22 working with the wildlife resources and conservation programs of western Riverside
23 County and the state of California. Paulek has extensive knowledge and career

24 experience reviewing and commenting on CEQA documents and has prepared multiple

25 CEQA documents for public and agency review. Petitioner seeks to compel the Fish and

26 Game Commission to correctly implement its CEQA duties to avoid and mitigate Project

27 impacts on the plant and animal resources of western Riverside County and the state of

28 California to conserve existing and future plant and animal habitat values and public
uses and enjoyment of those resources.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 4

12.
1 Petitioner presented oral comments and objections during the FGC public hearings

2 on the matter being challenged in this petition. Petitioner would be directly, adversely
and irreparably affected if this CEQA discretionary Project proceeds. Petitioner would
3 continue to be prejudiced by the project and its components, as described herein, until
4 and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition.
5

6 13. Respondent CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION (FGC) is a state agency

7 within the California Resources Agency. The Fish and Game Commission was created by

8 Section 20 of Article IV of the California Constitution. Among the powers delegated to

9 the Fish and Game Commission is the power to regulate the taking or possession of

10 birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. California Fish and Game Code § 86 -

11 "Take" means hunt, pursue, catch or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, or kill. The
California Legislature has declared that the five members of the Fish and Game
12 Commission are expected to make complex public policy and biological decisions on
13 behalf of the people of California.
14

15 14. Does through 20, inclusive are persons presently unknown to Petitioner, which are

16 subdivisions or officers of the state of California, who are responsible for the actions

17 described herein or for carrying out functions of the state and who may be affected by

18 this litigation. Petitioner will amend this petition to specifically identify each

19 respondent as required and as the capacity and identity of each respondent becomes
known.
20

21 15. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon allege that Real Party in
22 Interest the CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE (CDFW) is the

23 state agency having jurisdiction by law over the natural resources of California. The fish

24 and wildlife resources of California are held in trust for the people of the state by and

25 through the Department (Fish and Game Code § 711.7). The Mission of the Department

26 of Fish and Wildlife is to manage California's diverse fish, wildlife and plant resources

27 and the habitats upon which they depend for their ecological values and for their use

28 and enjoyment by the public. CDFW is charged with implementing and enforcing the

required and as capacity of each such respondent becomes known.

09392349 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17. Petitioner hereby re-allege and incorporate the allegations set forth in paragraph 1
through 16 inclusive.

18. Agenda Item #3 on the September 22, 2020 Fish and Game Commission public
hearing read as follows:

17 3. Western Joshua tree

18 Consider and potentially act on the petition, the Department's evaluation
report,

19 and comments received to determine whether listing western Joshua tree

20 (Yucca brevifolia) as a threatened or endangered species under the California

21 2074.2, Fish and Game Code)

22 Endangered Species Act (CESA) may be warranted.(pursuant to sections 2074 and

19.
23

24 On Agenda Item #3, in a unanimous 4-0 vote, the Commission determined that
listing western Joshua tree as threatened or endangered under CESA

25 was warranted.

26 This commenced the one-year status review of the western Joshua tree at the conclusion

27 of which the Commission will make the final listing decision. During the one-year status
review, the western Joshua tree is protected under CESA as a candidate species.

28 20. Agenda Item #4 on the September 22, 2020 Fish and Game Commission public
hearing read as follows:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 6

1 4. Conditional take of western Joshua tree during candidacy period:
If the Commission determines that listing may be warranted, consider 2 regulatory action to allow take of western Joshua tree under certain circumstances by
3 either authorizing a notice to adopt a regulation at a future meeting or adopting an
emergency regulation at this meeting, and consider taking final action under the
California Environmental Quality Act (Pursuant to sections 399 and 2084, Fish and

6 Game Code)

7

21. At the FGC meeting of August 19, 2020, the FGC heard testimony from solar project

9 proponents indicating concern about the inability of their solar projects to proceed

10 during the western Joshua tree CESA candidacy period. The DFW Director indicated

11 that there was a possibility to provide: "take" exemption for certain projects under
CESA section 2084 and that option could be explored in this case. After the August
12 2020 FGC meeting, several solar energy project proponents contacted the DFW to
13 indicate their concern about projects that had already completed environmental
14 permitting and review and were projected to initiate and complete construction

15 activities during the Joshua tree candidacy period. CFW subsequently requested the

16 solar energy project proponents interested in the 2084 incidental take option submit

17 their projects for consideration.

18
22.
19 The DFW Director met with the solar energy proponents representing 24 renewable

20 energy projects in Kern and San Bernardino counties to determine whether each of the
projects in Kern and San Bernardino counties met the criteria of having completed or
21 nearly completed permitting processes and anticipated near-term ground-breaking
22 activities. On September 18, 2020 the DFW provided the FGC with a proposed draft
23 regulation which identified 16 large-scale renewable energy projects and a process for

24 identifying impacts to western Joshua trees on the site of each of the projects and

25 allowing "take" with mitigation. At the September 22, 2020 FGC meeting, the DFW

26 Director testimony provided a nebulous project description for the 16 large-scale solar

27 projects [subsequently reduced to 15 solar projects] leaving the FGC and the public

28 uninformed as to project specifics such as project specific locations, impacted acreages,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 7

1 land ownership [public or private lands], project cumulative impacts and the need for
project CEQA Compliance.

23. Fish and Game Code § 2084 [California Endangered Species Act] provides:

cn (a) The Commission may authorize, subject to terms and conditions it prescribes, and

6 based on the best available scientific information, (1) the taking of any candidate

7 species, or (2) the taking of any fish by hook and line for sport that is listed as an

3 endangered, threatened, or candidate species, provided that in either case the take
is consistent with this chapter.

q

10 (b) The department may recommend to the commission that the commission authorize,
or not authorize, the taking of an endangered, threatened, or candidate

11 species pursuant to this section [emphasis added].

12
24.
13 Fish and Game Code § 399 - Division -

14 Regulations Section 399. Fish and Game Commission - Emergency

15

16 Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the commission, when

17 adopting, amending, or repealing a regulation pursuant to authority vested in it by

18 this code, may, after at least one hearing, adopt, amend, or repeal that regulation
pursuant to Section 11346.1 of the Government Code, if it makes either of the

19 following findings (California Administrative Procedure Act (APA)-Gov. Code §§

20 11365 - 11365) [emphasis added]:

21

22 (a) That the adoption, amendment, or repeal is necessary for the conservation,

23 preservation, or protection of birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, or reptiles,

24 including, but not limited to, their nests or eggs.

25

26 (b) That the adoption, amendment, or repeal is necessary for the immediate

27 preservation of the public peace, health and safety or general welfare
[emphasis added].

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 8

1 25. The FGC reliance on Gov. Code Section 11346.1 omitted that it requires the Finding
of emergency shall include a written statement: 2 "......a description of the specific facts demonstrating the existence of an 3 emergency and the need for immediate action, and demonstrating, by substantial
4 evidence, the need for the proposed regulation to effectuate the statute be implemented,
5 interpreted, or made specific and to address only the demonstrated emergency. The

6 finding of emergency shall also identify each technical, theoretical, and empirical

7 study, report, or similar document, if any, upon which the agency relies. The

8 enactment of an urgency statute shall not, in and of itself, constitute a need for

9 immediate action."

10 "A finding of emergency based only upon expediency, convenience, best interest,

11 general public need, or speculation, shall not be adequate to demonstrate the existence
of an emergency. If the situation identified in the finding of emergency existed and was
12 known by the agency adopting the emergency regulation in sufficient time to have
13 been addressed through nonemergency regulations adopted in accordance with the
14 provisions of Article 5 (commencing with Section 11346), the finding of emergency

15 shall include facts explaining the failure to address the situation through

16 nonemergency regulations."

17

18 26. Respondent Fish and Game Code § 399 (b) emergency definition:

19 ['"That the adoption, amendment, or repeal is necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety or general welfare."] does not 20 conform or reconcile with the Administrative Procedure Act emergency definition (Gov.
21 Code §11342.545) ["emergency" means a situation that calls for immediate action to
22 avoid serious harm to the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare."]
23 (emphasis added)

24

25 27. The FGC STAFF SUMMARY FOR SEPTEMBER 22, 2020 public meeting provided

26 the FGC the following Motion/Direction for Agenda Item NO. 4. CONDITIONAL

27 TAKE OF WESTERN JOSHUA TREE DURING CANDIDACY PERIOD:
that the Commission
28 Moved by and seconded by
finds, pursuant to Section 399 of the Fish and Game Code, that adopting the proposed

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 9

1 emergency regulation is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,

2 health and safety, or general welfare.
The Commission further determines, based on the record, that this approval is 3 exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act as an action necessary to
4 prevent or mitigate an emergency as specified in Subsection 15269(c), Title 14, and
5 Public Resources Code Section 21080(b)(4), as well as to protect a natural resource

6 pursuant to the guidelines in Title 14, Section 15307, and relying on Title 14, Subsection

7 15061(6)(3).

8 The Commission further determines, pursuant to Section 11346.1 of the

9 Government Code, that an emergency situation exist and finds the proposed regulation

10 is necessary to address the emergency.

11 Therefore, the Commission adopts the emergency regulation to add Section
749.10 to Title 14, California Code of Regulations, as discussed today.
12

13 28. FGC President Eric Sklar, Vice President Samantha Murray and Commissioners
14 Jacque Hostler-Carmesin and Peter Silva were present and voting at the September 22,
15 2020 public meeting. Commissioner Russel Burns, who had already recused himself

16 from the western Joshua decision at the August meeting, was absent. In a 3-1 vote

17 (Commission Vice President Samantha Murray was the dissenting vote), the FGC

18 adopted regulations to authorize conditional take of western Joshua tree during its

19 candidacy for 15 solar energy projects expected to break ground within the year. The
DFW September 22, 2020 press release for the FGC vote indicated the emergency 20 rulemaking was a result of discussion and consultation between the California
21 Department of Fish and Wildlife, renewable energy developers, local governments and
22 the CESA petitioner, the Center for Biological Diversity.
23

24 29. Petitioner exhausted all his administrative remedies prior to the Approval of this

25 CEQA discretionary Project, when providing oral testimony to the FGC at the September

26 22, 2020 public hearing by objecting to the incorrect use of CEQA exemptions and the

27 failure of the FGC to correctly carryout its CEQA duties as required by law. All issues

28 raised in this petition were raised before Respondents by Petitioner, other members of
the public, or public agencies prior to the approval of the project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 10

-
2 30. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service
upon the California Fish and Game Commission indicating his intent to file this petition.
Proof of service of this notification with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.
4

31. Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned
proceedings or pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public
Resources Code § 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to Prepare the

8 Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.

32. Petitioner has served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's Office to give
P0332 notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney general under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 which notice is attached as Exhibit C.

33. Petitioner has filed and served a request for Hearing and thus complied with Public
Resources Code § 21167.4. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit D.

16 34. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167

17 and CEQA Guideline 15112.

18

19 35. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the
following ways:
20

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22

23 VIOLATION OF CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

24 The California Fish and Game Commission Did Not Comply with CEQA

25

26 36. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

27

28 37. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the Legislature
declared it is the policy of the state to:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 11

1 "prevent the elimination of fish and wildlife species due to man's activities, ensure that
fish and wildlife populations do not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve 2 for future generations representatives of all plant and animal communities... " (Public
Resources Code § 21001(c)). "Public agencies should not approve projects if there are
feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures, which would
substantially lessen significant environmental effects of such projects, and that

6 procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in
systematically identifying both significant effects of the proposed project and
feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or

9 substantially lessen such significant effects." (Public Resources Code § 21002). "T'he

10 purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to identify the Significant
effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate 11 the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."
12 (Public Resources Code ! 21002.1) [emphasis added].
13

14 38. The FGC Approval/Authorization of the "Conditional take" of western Joshua tree on
15 15 solar energy projects located in the California desert violated the California

16 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The "Conditional take" authorization by the FGC

17 was a discretionary project under CEQA as it "requires the exercise of judgement or

18 deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a

19 particular activity" (CEQA Guidelines § 15357). Under CEQA an agency contemplating
an action having "the potential to.... reduce the number or restrict the range of an
20 endangered, rare or threatened species" (CEQA Guideline § 15065 subd. (a)) must find
21 that the project "may have a significant effect on the environment" (Guidelines
22 15065). Because the "conditional take" on 15 solar energy projects in the California
23 desert will result in population reduction and habitat restriction of the western Joshua

24 tree the FGC was obligated to find the "Conditional take" may have a significant

25 environmental effect. Such a finding precludes invocation of a categorical exemption by

26 the FGC (Mountain lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th

27 65, 124-125).

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 12

1 39. The FGC authorized the "conditional take" of western Joshua trees under CESA
section 2084 ["The department [DFW] may recommend to the commission that the
2

04 40 commission authorize, or not authorize, the taking of endangered, threatened, or
candidate species pursuant to this section."]. During the FGC one-year status review
the western Joshua tree is protected under the California Endangered Species Act
(CESA) as a candidate species (Fish and Game Code § 2085). Under CEQA the now

6 candidate western Joshua tree shall nevertheless be considered to be endangered, rare

7 or threatened pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15380(d). FGC regulatory actions under

8 CESA, such as "Conditional take" of candidate species, are not exempt from CEQA
556ES0 compliance (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 196).

40. The FGC assertion that the "conditional take" of western Joshua tree is entitled to a
statutory exemption under CEQA as an action necessary to prevent or mitigate an
emergency [impending climate change] as specified in subsection 15269(c) Title 14
[CEQA Guidelines] is in error. Section 15269(c) provides: "Specific actions necessary to
prevent or mitigate an emergency. This does not include long-term projects
undertaken for the purpose of preventing or mitigating a situation that has a low
16 probability of occurrence in the short-term." CEQA Guidelines § 15359 EMERGENCY

17 definition is as follows: "Emergency" means a sudden, unexpected occurrence,

18 involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or

19 mitigate loss of, or damage to life, health, property, or essential public services.

20 Emergency includes such occurrences as fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or
geologic movements, as well as such occurrences as riot, accident, or sabotage." The
21 construction of 15 long-term solar energy projects in the California desert has a low
22 probability of occurrence for the purpose of preventing or mitigating impending climate
23 change impacts in the short-term. The claimed emergency is not a sudden unexpected

24 occurrence, involving imminent danger and demanding immediate action. The climate

25 change emergency will not be realized in the short time period required for the FGC to

26 perform the mandated CEQA analysis of the solar projects impacts and/or benefits. The

27 FGC failed to proceed in the manner required by law and the FGC emergency

28 determination is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 13

41. The FGC Approval of the emergency "conditional take" of the western Joshua tree
also relied upon two CEQA Categorical exemptions. Categorical exemption § 15307
[ACTIONS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES FOR PROTECTION OF NATURAL
RESOURCES] and Categorical exemption § 15061(b)(3) [aka- the common sense
exemption "...CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a
5 significant effect on the environment ... if no possibility that the activity may have a

6 significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA] are in error.

7 A Categorical exemption represents a determination by the Secretary of Resources that a

8 particular class of projects does not have a significant effect on the environment (Public

9 Resources Code § 21084). The "conditional take" Approval by the FGC is an action

10 having "the potential to...reduce the number and restrict the range" of the candidate

11 species western Joshua tree. The FGC must find that "conditional take" of Joshua trees
"may have a significant effect on the environment" (CEQA Guideline § 15065(a) - 12 MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE). The FGC is obligated to find the
13 "conditional take" of Joshua trees may have a significant environmental effect.
14 Moreover, the 15065(a) mandatory finding precludes the categorical exemptions relied

15 upon by the FGC.

16

17 42. Categorical exemptions relied upon by the FGC are not to be expanded beyond the

18 reasonable scope of their statutory language. Under the commonsense exemption a FGC

19 action having the potential for a significant effect [take of Joshua trees] would be
outside the scope of the categorical exemption 15061(b)(3) because CEQA applies only 20 to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment.
21 Similarly, the "conditional take" of Joshua trees cannot be fairly included in exemption
22 § 15307 as an action by a regulatory agency for the protection of Natural Resources.
23 The Project facts are outside the scope of the categorical exemptions offered by the FGC

24 (Mountain lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal 4th 65, 124-

25 125).

26

27 43. The FGC is included in the list of state regulatory agencies certified by the Secretary

28 for Resources as being exempt from the requirements for preparing EIRs, Negative
Declarations and Initial Studies if the FGC program meets the criteria contained in

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - 14

1 section 21080.5 (d)(1)(2)(3) of the Public Resources Code. The FGC certified regulatory
program remains subject to other provisions in CEQA such as the policy of avoiding
significant adverse effects on the environment where feasible. (CEQA Guidelines 15250).
The FGC failed to follow the procedures of its own certified regulatory program claiming
4 instead the "conditional take" of western Joshua tree was exempt from CEQA review.
The FGC failed to proceed as required by law.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8

Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondent and Real Party
in Interest 10

11
44. Petitioner hereby allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations 12 contained in the foregoing paragraphs.
13

14 45. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,
15 Respondent and Real Party in Interest will implement the Project despite its lack of
