ORANCE COUNTY COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

*2 1. Through this action Petitioner SANTEE TROLLEY SQUARE 991, LP

3 ("Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandate and injunctive relief against the CITY OF SANTEE and

4 the CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SANTEE (together, "City" or "Respondents") and

5 EXCEL HOTEL GROUP and EXCEL ACQUISITIONS, LLC (together, "Real Parties") on

6 grounds the City has violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,

7 §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA"), in myriad ways, through its aggressive pursuit of and commitment

8 to a four-story, 96-room hotel development project (*Hotel Project") to be constructed within

9 Santee Trolley Square, a shopping center owned and operated by Petitioner.

10 2. CEQA requires that public agencies analyze, identify, and disclose to the public

11 and its own decisionmakers, the potential environmental impacts of their actions--before taking

12 them. Yet, as described herein, the City has quickly, assuredly, and aggressively committed itself

13 to a specific project, without so much as considering environmental review. To effectuate its

14 desired Hotel Project, the City has taken several concrete steps, including, but not limited to:

15 making discretionary determinations as to the Hotel Project being the appropriate use of a portion

16 of Santee Trolley Square; demanding that Petitioner execute a quitclaim deed conveying a portion

17 of its property to the City for the Hotel Project; committing itself so fully to a specific site plan

18 such that the City rejected the possibility of other iterations or alterations to the Hotel Project's

19 design, regardless of the project's impact on the surrounding environment; and preparing a

20 Disposition and Development Agreement ("DDA") between the City and Real Parties that

21 describes the Hotel Project with such specificity as to declare it will be "four-story hotel

22 consisting of approximately 96 rooms, a breakfast seating area, a pool with a deck, and

23 approximately 80 parking spaces."

24 3. Despite the City's commitment to the Hotel Project, and even though the Hotel

25 Project has progressed to the point where the City will not even entertain modifications to its

26 design, the City has undertaken no environmental review, as required by CEQA.

pal JURISDICTION AND VENUE

*2 11.

3 This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and/or

4 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5. Respondent City is located

5 within the County of San Diego, and the Hotel Project is also to be sited within the City of

Santee.

6 12.

7 Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 395,

8 as the acts and omissions alleged herein took place within the County of San Diego.

9 STANDING, EXHAUSTION AND OTHER JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

13.

10 Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in the City's full and

11 complete compliance with the mandates of CEQA, and all other laws. Petitioner owns and

12 operates Santee Trolley Square, a portion of which is the property the City is aggressively seeking

13 to acquire and develop as the Hotel Project. Petitioner's property will be directly and adversely

14 affected by the development of an incompatible and intensive, four-story hotel substantially

15 surrounded by the remainder of Santee Trolley Square. Petitioner's property will bear the

16 greatest burden of the Hotel Project's environmental impacts, which have not been analyzed or

17 disclosed by the City. Therefore, Petitioner will be irreparably and detrimentally affected and

18 aggrieved if the relief requested herein is not granted and the City is permitted to continue to

19 pursue and commit itself to the Hotel Project without undertaking the requisite environmental

20 review. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1086; see also Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 272.)
14.

21 In addition, Petitioner has a substantial public interest in the City's full and

22 complete compliance with the mandates of CEQA, and all other applicable laws. As a property

23 owner within the City, Petitioner will be adversely affected by the Hotel Project's environmental

24 impacts. (See Citizens Assoc. for Sensible Development v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d

25 151, 158 [geographic proximity enough to establish public interest standing].)

15.

26 The City owes a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal

27 authorities before exercising its discretion to commit to and approve-as those terms are defined

3 16. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

4 of law, and will suffer irreparable harm unless this Court issues the relief requested in this

5 Petition.

6 17. Petitioner has objected to the City's actions relating to the Hotel Project in its

7 correspondence with the City. However, no public hearing has been held by the City on the Hotel

8 Project that would have provided Petitioner-or any other individual or entity--with a

9 meaningful opportunity to formally object on the record. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177(e) [no
10 exhaustion of administrative remedies required when no public hearing is held].)
11 18. Petitioner has complied with all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this
12 action, including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, by
13 providing notice to the City that this action would be filed. Petitioner served a Notice of Intent to

14 File this Petition on the City of Santee City Clerk's Office by mail on February 7, 2020, a copy of
15 which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16 19. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General
17 as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

18 20. Petitioner hereby and by a separate election filed herewith notifies the City that

19 Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings for the Hotel Project in compliance with
20 Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).

21 21. Petitioner brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of the general public, and
22 in the public interest, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources

23 Code section 21168 or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and

ORANCE COUNTY COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

FACTS

'2 A. SANTEE TROLLEY SQUARE

3 22. Santee Trolley Square is an approximately 32-acre shopping center, generally

4 bounded by Cuyamaca Street to the west, Mission Gorge Road to the south, Riverview Parkway

5 to the east, and Town Center Parkway to the north, within the City of Santee.

6 23. The original project entitlements for Santee Trolley Square were issued in 2001, at
7 which time the City approved an Amended and Restated Disposition and Development

8 Agreement, an Amendment to the Town Center Specific Plan, a Conditional Use Permit, and a

9 Tentative Parcel Map. The City also certified an Environmental Impact Report for the same.

10 Together, these City actions permitted the development of the Santee Trolley Square commercial
11 shopping center.

12 24. As described in the City's July 25, 2001 staff report presenting the Santee Trolley
13 Square entitlements to the City Council for approval, Santee Trolley Square was "conditioned to

14 construct a number of public improvements, including drainage improvements, street

15 improvements and on-site facilities." The "on-site facilities" were described by the City as: "a
16 Sheriff's storefront (which could also be used for other community outreach purposes) in the
17 central grouping of buildings along the trolley tracks and an approximately two-acre site at the
18 northeast corner of [Santee Trolley Square] which will be deeded to the City for use as a future
19 public library. Should this site not be used for library, the City retains ownership and may use
20 the site for another civic or public use.' (Emphasis added.)

21 25. In accordance with the provisions of the Santee Trolley Square entitlements, in
22 December 2001 a Parcel Map was recorded by the then-owner of the Santee Trolley Square site.
23 The Parcel Map included the following: "We hereby make an irrevocable offer of dedication of

24 Parcel 4 as a site for future construction of a public library subject to the conditions set forth in
25 the Amended and Restated Disposition and Development Agreement [for the Santee Trolley

26 Square development]. . . ." (Emphasis added.)

PHILLIPS, LLP PETITIONER SANTEE TROLLEY SQUARE 991, LP'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
ORANCE COUNTY COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

26. Parcel 4 is identified on the Parcel Map as a 1.62-acre parcel adjacent to what is

2 now Town Center Road, along the northern boundary of Santee Trolley Square.

3 27. To Petitioner's knowledge, over the course of the next two decades, the City did

4 not meaningfully pursue development of the public library, or any other "civic or public use" on

5 Parcel 4. Nor did the City accept the irrevocable offer of dedication recorded on the Santee

6 Trolley Square Parcel Map.

7 B. THE HOTEL PROJECT

8 28. After nearly two decades passing without the City accepting the irrevocable offer
O of dedication of Parcel 4 for use as a public library, in 2019, the City decided, without warning,

10 that it did want to claim Parcel 4 but not for the public library, as was always intended, or even

11 for "another civic or public use."

12 29. Instead, Petitioner believes that by this point the City had already begun backroom
13 a negotiations with a private hotel developer and had hatched a plan to sell Parcel 4 off for a $1.4

14 million profit.

15 30. Thus, the City began, full steam ahead, on coordinating and ensuring development
16 of the Hotel Project.

17 31. As one of the first concrete steps in effectuating its Hotel Project, on or about

18 August 14, 2019 the City Council took discretionary action and declared-via minute order and

19 without public hearing that instead of using Parcel 4 for development of a public library, as was

20 always intended, Parcel 4 "would be more beneficial to the City as an alternate use." City

21 documents make clear that by this point, the City had already decided that it wanted a private
22 hotel at this location.

23 32. No factual, evidentiary support was provided by the City supporting a finding that
24 Parcel 4 was now no longer appropriate for a public library.

25 33. No environmental analysis was done by the City, disclosing to either to the public

26 or to the City Council the myriad environmental impacts that could result from replacing the
27 library with a private, four-story, 96-room Hotel Project.

28 - 7 -
MANATT, PHELPS &
PHILLIPS, LLP PETITIONER SANTEE TROLLEY SQUARE 991, LP'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND ATTORNEYS AT LAW COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ORANGE COUNTY

- 34.

2 Instead, the August 14, 2019 staff report claimed, without any substantial

3 evidence, that the City Council's discretionary decision--the decision to abandon its plans to

4 construct a library on Parcel 4 and replace the library with a four-story, 96-room hotel "more

5 beneficial to the City"-was not subject to environmental review under State CEQA Guidelines

6 sections 15060, subdivision (c) and 15378, subdivision (b). Yet neither of these citations, which

7 exempt five specific types of actions (proposals for legislation, continuing administrative or

8 maintenance activities, submittals of proposals to a vote a of the people, the creation of government
funding mechanisms, or organizational or administrative activities of governments) support the
City's conclusion that CEQA does not apply.
10 35.

11 In September 2019, the City began its demands that Petitioner execute a quitclaim

12 deed conveying Parcel 4 to the City, for the sole purpose of effectuating the Hotel project.

36.

13 Separately, behind the scenes and out of the public eye, negotiations were by late

14 2019 well underway between the City and Real Parties to identify the "price and terms of

15 payment" for Parcel 4. Later, Petitioner learned via the City's website postings that the "price

16 and terms of payment" include a purchase price of $1.4 million, to be paid by Real Parties to the

17 City, and development of a specific "four-story hotel, consisting of approximately 96 rooms, a

18 breakfast seating area, a pool with a deck, and approximately 80 parking spaces."

37.

19 Despite being taken aback by the City's sudden interest in obtaining Petitioner's

20 property for a private use that was never before contemplated for Parcel 4, Petitioner tried to be

21 accommodating. In a good faith effort at cooperation, Petitioner expressed to both City and Real

22 Parties its concerns regarding the environmental impacts of the Hotel Project on Santee Trolley

23 Square. These concerns include, but are not limited to, impacts on parking, traffic circulation,

24 and access. Petitioner even went so far as to suggest minor site plan revisions that could possibly

25 reduce the Hotel Project's impacts on the surrounding area. Yet in response to Petitioner's

26 suggestions, Petitioner was told that the site plan for the Hotel Project cannot be revised and

27 Petitioner's suggestions cannot be incorporated. Specifically, the City and Real Parties state that

28 at this point the Hotel Project's building footprint cannot be shifted, the Hotel Project's parking

MANATT, PHELPS &: - 8 -

CRANCE COUNTY PETITIONER SANTEE TROLLEY SQUARE 991, LP'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 spaces cannot be moved, even the Hotel Project's guest rooms' orientation cannot be changed--

2 despite the potential for these project revisions, mitigation measures and/or alternatives to reduce

3 impacts on the surrounding area.

4 38. Other details are also, at this point, determined, including that the Hotel Project

5 will be developed as an upper midscale Hilton Home2Suites or a Marriott TownPlace Suites

6 project.

7 39. As the City and Real Parties continue to jettison each of Petitioner's suggestions

8 for reducing the impacts of the now seemingly finalized Hotel Project, the City continues its
9 strong-armed tactics to wrest Parcel 4 from Petitioner. City staff, including both the City

10 Manager and the City Attorney's office, demanded execution of a quitclaim deed conveying
11 Parcel 4 to the City, telling Petitioner that "we need that deed by the end of the year" and stating
12 that "if we don't receive it we are going to have to start looking at damages."
13 40. By early January 2020, the City disclosed to the public, via postings on the City
14 website, that the DDA to be executed by and between the City and Real Parties would result in a

15 payment from Real Parties to the City of $1.4 million and development of a very specific project:
16 a four-story, 96-room hotel. Yet, to date, no environmental review has been completed.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (For Writ of Mandate, Public Resources Code §21167, Violation of CEQA)

19 41. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1
20 through 40, above.

21 42. CEQA requires that public agencies analyze and disclose the environmental
22 impacts of "projects" prior to their approval. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080(a); State CEQA
23 Guidelines [Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, 15000 et seq-], §§ 15004, 15352(b); Save Tara v. City of
24 West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116 ['"Save Tara".)

25 43. The City has failed to comply with CEQA in its refusal to conduct any

26 environmental review of the Hotel Project, despite its ongoing authorization of the Hotel Project,

-

2 its financial investment in the Hotel Project, and the Hotel Project's sufficiently detailed and
specific project description, to which the City has committed itself.
44.

4 The City has violated CEQA by failing to undertake environmental review prior to

5 its City Council action on August 14, 2019. The City's determination that the City Council's

6 August 14, 2019 decision to abandon the library and replace it with the Hotel Project is not

7 subject to environmental review pursuant is flatly inconsistent with the applicable law. The

8 City's reliance on State CEQA Guidelines sections 15060(a) and 15378(b) for its conclusion that

9 its August 14, 2019 action is not subject to CEQA is wholly unsubstantiated and violates CEQA

10 because the City's action does constitute a "project" for purposes of CEQA. (Pub. Resources

11 Code, §§ 21080(a) [CEQA applies to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or

12 approved by public agencies], 21065 ['"project" is defined as an activity carried out, supported by,

13 or authorized by a public agency, and which may cause either a direct physical change in the

14 environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment]; State

15 CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a) [same]; see also Van de Kamps Coalition v. Board of Trustees of

16 Los Angeles Community College Dist. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4*h 1036.) None of the exceptions to

17 CEQA's definition of a "project" listed in the regulations relied upon by the City-proposals for
legislation, continuing administrative or maintenance activities,

18 submittals of proposals to a vote

19 of the people, the creation of government funding mechanisms, or organizational or

20 administrative activities of governments-apply. (See State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(b).)
45.

21 The City has violated CEQA by failing to undertake environmental review prior to

22 demanding that Petitioner execute a quitclaim deed for Parcel 4. The City's demand that
Petitioner execute the quitclaim deed is for the

23 sole purpose of allowing the City to turn around

24 4 and sell Parcel 4 for development of the Hotel Project. This also constitutes "project" for

25 purposes of CEQA, and thus such a step cannot be taken until environmental review is complete.

26 (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15352(a) ["approval" refers to any public agency decision that
commits the agency

27 to a definite course of action in regard to a project], 15004(b)(2) [public

agency may not acquire a site or take any action that gives "impetus to a planned or foreseeable
2 project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures"].)

3 46. The City has violated CEQA by refusing to entertain any potential revisions or
4 changes to the Hotel Project-including shifting the building footprint, moving parking spaces, or

5 changing the guest room orientation-in order to reduce the Hotel Project's impacts on the

6 surrounding environment. The City and Real Parties' refusals make clear that the City has not

7 retained its discretion to adopt a project alternative or impose project mitigation measures. (Save

8 Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 139 [courts look to whether, as a practical matter, the agency has

9 committed itself to the project].)

10 47. The City has violated CEQA by publicly declaring that the Hotel Project will

11 consist of exactly four-stories, 96-rooms, a breakfast seating area, a pool with a deck, and

12 approximately 80 parking spaces. As a result, it is clear that the City has not retained its

13 discretion to adopt a project alternative or impose project mitigation measures. (Save Tara,

14 supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 139.)

15 48. The City has violated CEQA in that the totality of the City's actions, statements,

16 financial stake, and refusal to entertain project alternatives, mitigation measures, or any project

17 design changes indicate that the City has committed itself to the project and/or its particular

18 features as a practical matter. (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 139.)

19 49. The City has violated CEQA in that the totality of the City's actions indicate that

20 any subsequent or future environmental review of the Hotel project would in fact be a sham and

21 post-hoc rationalization of a project already "approved" for purposes of CEQA, as the City is

22 already so deeply invested in the Hotel Project as it is now defined and designed it would not be

23 reasonable to assume the City would alter the project in response to environmental impacts,
24 especially those that have already been brought to the City's attention.

25 50. The City has violated CEQA by ignoring the myriad environmental impacts that
26 would be caused by developing a private hotel on a site previously intended for use as a public

27 library. These impacts include, but are not limited to, impacts associated with aesthetics, energy,

greenhouse gas emissions, hydrology, land use and planning, land use compatibility, noise,
2 transportation, pedestrian safety and hazards, parking, and utilities. (State CEQA Guidelines,

3 § 15360.)

51. The City has violated CEQA's mandate that public agencies analyze the "whole of

5 the project" and not improperly segment a project into smaller pieces and actions that the agency

6 'can argue are, alone, not subject to environmental review. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a),

7 (c)-(d); Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora (2007) 155

8 Cal.App.4™h 1214 [CEQA "cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-sized

9 pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the

10 environment or to be only ministerial"].)

11 52. The City has violated CEQA by ignoring the fact that neither the City Council's

12 August 14, 2019 determination regarding Parcel 4, nor the City's demands that Petitioner execute

13 the quitclaim deed to convey Parcel 4, have any standalone, independent utility. Therefore, for

14 purposes of CEQA, they are part of the Hotel Project and environmental analysis of the Hotel

15 Project was required before those actions were taken. (Del Mar Terrace Conservancy, Inc. v.

16 City Council (1992) 10 Cal.App.4t 712, 731-737, disapproved on other grounds in Western

17 States Petroleum Assoc. v. Super. Ct. (1995) 9 Cal.4t 559, 576, fn. 6.)
18 53. The City has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thereby

19 prejudicially abused its discretion, by its failure to comply with CEQA's mandates.
20 54. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy other than the issuance of a

21 writ of mandate ordering the City to forgo any and all steps in furtherance of the Hotel Project

22 unless and until it complies with CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.9.)

23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (For Temporary, Preliminary, and Permanent Injunctive Relief Against All Respondents,

25 Defendants, and Real Parties in Interest)

26 55. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1

27 through 54, above.
