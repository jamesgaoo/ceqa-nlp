14 CITY OF REDDING; (Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.;

23 Petitioner, Kulveer Kaur ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of

24 Mandate and Complaint as follows:

25 INTRODUCTION

26 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent City of Redding ("City" or
27 "Respondent") of the mitigated negative declaration and the related discretionary approvals for a
28 proposed development located at 2450 Goodwater Avenue, in Redding, California.

-1-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the

2 Project approvals, actions, resolutions, ordinances and findings related to the Project, as well as

3 the mitigated negative declaration considered by Respondent, including any authorizations to
4 proceed with construction. The Project was approved by the City on or about January 21, 2020.

5 Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project approvals because Respondent failed to

6 comply with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
7 Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local

8 laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

9 3. This petition and complaint also seeks a declaration of rights that the City

10 unlawfully amended its General Plan by the act of its Development Services Director adopting a

11 policy that conflicts with the plain language of the General Plan.

12 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under Code of Civil Procedure

13 section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project approvals and

14 the adoption of the mitigated negative declaration because Respondent failed to comply with

15 CEQA and applicable planning and zoning laws.

16 PARTIES

17 5. Petitioner and plaintiff Kulveer Kaur is a citizen of the State of California and a

18 property and business owner in the City of Redding. Petitioner owns commercial real property

19 near the intersection of Goodwater Avenue and Shasta View Drive. Petitioner is beneficially

20 interested in procuring the enforcement of a public duty imposed on the City Council by the

21 terms of the General Plan when considering applications for General Plan amendments, as

22 detailed below, and under the California Environmental Quality Act.

23 6. Respondent and defendant City of Redding ("City") is, and at all times mentioned

24 herein was, a municipal corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of

25 California.

26 7. Respondent and defendant City Council of the City of Redding ("City Council")

27 is, and at all times mentioned herein was, the governing body of the City.

28
-2-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

8. Respondent is informed and believers that Real Party in interest Jagdeep Singh

2 Randhawa is a resident of the City of Redding, the proposed developer of 2450 Goodwater, and

3 the applicant for the General Plan amendment at issue herein.
9. The true names and capacities of Respondents Does 1 through 10 are unknown to
Petitioner, who will amend this petition to insert their true names and capacities when they have

6 been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at all times relevant

7 to this action, each of the respondents and defendants ("respondent"), including Does 1 through

8 10, was the agent or employee of the remaining respondents and, while acting within the scope

9 and course of such agency or employments, took part in the actions and omissions alleged in this

10 Petition.

11 10. The true names and capacities of Respondents Does 11 through 50 are unknown

12 to Petitioner, who will amend this petition to insert their true names and capacities when they

13 have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the
14 respondents Does 11 through 50 is a person of interest in the subject matter of this actions, or

15 claims an interest related to the subject matter of this action.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under sections 1085 and 1094.5 of

18 the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.4 of the Public Resources Code.

19 12. Venue for this action properly lies in the Shasta County Superior Court because

20 Respondent and the Project are located in Shasta County.

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 13. The Project is a gas station containing 16 fueling stations, a 3,180 square foot

23 convenience store and car wash on property located at 2450 Goodwater Avenue. Prior to the

24 City's action, the land use designation for the property was Limited Office. The property is

25 located adjacent to a small commercial office complex on land also designated Limited Office,

26 and private, residential property. There are two churches nearby, but no other commercial

27 development in the immediate vicinity of the Project.

28

-3-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

1 14. On or about June 18, 2018, the City Council approved a General Plan

2 Amendment, a Rezoning Application, and a Site Development Permit to change a site

3 designation at 2450 Goodwater Avenue on the General Plan from Limited Office ("LO") to

4 Neighborhood Commercial ("NC), and Rezoning Application to allow for Real Party in Interest

5 to construct a 3,180 square foot convenience gas mart and carwash.

6 15. Following that approval, on or about August 10, 2018, Petitioner filed a Petition

7 for Writ of Mandate challenging the City's approval on the grounds the City failed to comply

8 with the General Plan, in particular, General Plan Goal CD13.
9 16. The City' General Plan Goal CDD13 reads: "Designate retail commercial lands in

10 appropriate locations to meet the present and future needs of Redding's residents and visitors and
11 to maintain the City's economic vitality."

12 17. General Plan Policy CDD13A is one of the policies designed to achieve Goal

13 CDD 13. That policy states:

14 Ensure that adequate commercial lands are identified on the General Plan
15 Diagram to meet existing and projected market demand for local and regional retail commercial activity. Proposed amendments to the Diagram, not initiated by
16 the Planning Commission or City Council, will be considered appropriate in

17 instances where there is a demonstrated need for additional retail commercial
land to serve the existing and projected retail market within a 5-year time
18 horizon. Applicants for General Plan amendments, including applications
initiated by the City on public lands, shall provide a market analysis, the
19 scope of which must be approved by the City, sufficiently detailed to

20 determine if the above market criteria are in evidence. Demonstrating only
that a particular location would be economically viable for an intended use will
21 not constitute, in and of itself, sufficient grounds for a General Plan amendment.
(Emphasis added.)
22 18. On or about July 24, 2018, after the Project was initially approved, the
23 Development Services Director adopted Policy 2018-01. That policy essentially eliminated the
24 requirement for the applicant to demonstrate a need for additional retail commercial land in the
25 area and the market analysis required by the General Plan by limiting such analysis to General
26 Plan amendments involving what the Director considers "significant retail commercial projects",
27 a phrase that appears nowhere in General Plan Policy CDD13A.
28

-4-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

1 19. The City and Petitioner Kaur agreed to settle the first lawsuit based on an

2 agreement that the City would withdraw its approvals of the Goodwater Project and start the

3 process anew.

4 20. Thereafter, the City began processing Site Development Permit Application SDP-

5 2019-01426, Rezoning Application RZ-2019-01427 and General Plan Amendment Application

6 GPA-2019-01429 on behalf of Real Party in Interest. However, the City did not conduct any new

7 analysis and simply recycled its previous documentation prepared in connection with its previous

8 approval of the Project.

9 21. On November 21, 2019, counsel for Petitioner submitted correspondence to Bert

10 Meyer, Chairman of the City of Redding Planning Commission, raising various issues, including

11 but not limited to the fact that no market analysis required by General Plan Policy CDD13A had

12 been prepared for the project and that Policy 2018-01 conflicted with the General Plan.

13 22. In a report of the Planning Department dated November 12, 2019, submitted to
14 the Planning Commission, the Planning Department gave the background of the prior application

15 and approvals and the prior litigation. After reciting the basis for the prior approvals, the report

16 simply concluded that the proposed project "has been thoroughly considered and impacts from
17 the proposed change have been adequately mitigated through project conditions." No portion of

18 the report discusses the General Plan requirement of a market analysis, and one is not included in

19 the report or any of the application documents.
20 23. At its regular meeting on November 12, the Redding Planning Commission met to

21 consider approval of the site development permit application SDP-2017-01262, Rezoning

22 Application RZ-2017-00954, and General Plan Amendment Application GPA-2017-00955. The

23 matter was approved by the Planning Commission and thereafter was referred to the City

24 Council for final consideration.

25 24. On January 15, 2020, counsel for Petitioner submitted correspondence to the

26 Redding City Council expressing the same concerns regarding the market analysis required by

27 General Plan Policy CDD13A. Counsel's letter also pointed out that Policy 2018-01 conflicts on

28 its face with "General Plan Policy CDD13A and is .. itself an amendment to the General Plan."
-5-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

(Italics in original.) Petitioner's counsel also noted that no market analysis as required by Policy

2 CDD13A had been conducted for the project

3 25. Other comments were submitted to the Redding City Council, including claims

4 that the project is not compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and that the City failed to

5 require any monitoring to verify that project noise and lighting issues are properly mitigated. An

6 additional issue was raised with respect to the fact that the City failed to recirculate its initial

7 study with two new sections regarding energy and tribal cultural resources and failed to send out
tribal consultation letters as required by AB52. Instead the City relied on its 2017 Initial Study

9 and documentation prepared for the original project approval.

10 26. The Redding City Council met in regular session on January 21, 2020 to consider

11 and vote upon the re-filed application.

12 27. Despite Petitioner's and other interested parties' objections and comments, both

13 in writing as well as presented orally to the Planning Commission, City Council and City staff,

14 Respondent City Council voted to approve the applications, offer an ordinance to amend the

15 City's Zoning Map, adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration, amend the General Plan to permit

16 a change for the subject property from limited office to neighborhood commercial, and approve
17 the requested site development permit. Based on the comments given by City Council members,

18 the project was approved by this Council because approval had already been given by the

19 previous City Council. These comments suggest that no independent review was in fact given by
20 the City Council.

21 28. Petitioner has fully exhausted all administrative remedies available relating to the

22 claims alleged in the Petition.

23 29. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available in the ordinary

24 course of law for redress of the claims alleged in this Petition.

25 First Cause of Action

26 (California Environmental Quality Act)

27 30. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in

28 paragraphs 1 through 29 of this Petition.
-6-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

,

35. By failing to require the performance of a market survey, and relying instead on

2 the policy adopted by the Development Services Director, the City failed to comply with the

3 General Plan's mandate and, therefore, the City's decision is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse

4 of its discretion in approving the amendment to the General Plan and in approving the zoning

5 amendment for the Goodwater project.

6 36. Respondents approved a 16-pump, 24-hour service station on property rezoned to

7 Neighborhood Commercial. Petitioner contends that a service station that size is not appropriate
for property zoned as Neighborhood Commercial and conflicts with the surrounding properties

9 and their uses. Petitioner is informed and believes that every 16-pump service station in Redding

10 lies on property that is zoned General Commercial. Accordingly, Respondents' approval is in
11 conflict with the General Plan and with the land uses surrounding the subject property.

12 37. By failing to limit the size of the approved service station, the Respondents failed

13 to comply with the General Plan's mandate and its zoning laws. Therefore, Respondents'

14 decision is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of its discretion in approving the zoning

15 amendment for the Goodwater project.

16 pray for relief as set forth below. WHEREFORE, Petitioners

17 Third Cause of Action

18 (Declaratory Relief)

19 38. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in

20 paragraphs 1 through 37 of this Petition.

21 39. Petitioner respectfully submits that compliance with CDD13A is mandatory under

22 the General Plan and that the Development Services Director's adoption of Policy 2018-01

23 conflicts with that policy.

24 40. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and

25 Respondents in that Petitioner contends that the Director's adoption of Policy 2018-01 and the

26 City Council's approval of the General Plan amendment for the project was enacted in violation

27 is of law and is invalid and unenforceable. Petitioner also contends that Policy 2018-01 is

28 inconsistent with the General Plan in that it modifies the express requirements in the General
-8-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE

T Plan concerning the market analysis required for certain general plan amendments. Petitioner

2 further contends that the size of the approved service station that is part of the project is in

3 conflict with the General Plan and with the City's zoning laws and is incompatible with the land

4 uses surrounding the project. Respondents deny these allegations and contend that the actions of

5 the Director and the City Council were in all respects valid and lawful. A judicial declaration

6 concerning the validity of Policy 2018-01, its consistency with the General Plan, and the City

7 Council's approval of the General Plan Amendment and approval of zoning change at issue is

8 necessary and appropriate at this time So that the parties may ascertain their rights with respect

9 thereto.

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as set forth below.

11 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING

12 41. On February 18, 2020, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through counsel,

13 served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding

14 against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the project. A copy of the Notice
15 together with proof of service is filed concurrently with this Petition.

16 42. On February 19, 2020, Petitioner, through counsel, served the California Attorney

17 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy

18 of this Petition. A copy of such notice (without the copy of this Petition attached to such notice),

19 together with proof of service, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein
20 by this reference. Such notice satisfies Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section

21 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

22 Prayer for Relief

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:

24 1. For a temporary stay pending determination of this Petition to preclude Real Party

25 from beginning construction of the subject Project;
26 2. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate or other appropriate relief directing
