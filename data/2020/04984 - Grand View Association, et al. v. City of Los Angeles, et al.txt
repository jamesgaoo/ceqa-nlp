oœNO A0 Petitioners, Grand View Association and Alejandra M. Castro, allege:

1. Introduction
By this action, Petitioners challenge the decision of the City of Los Angeles,
made by the Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles City Planning
Commission (collectively, the City), to approve the development of, and to
adopt a CEQA Categorical Exemption for, the Abode Project (the Project)

10 Los Angeles.
2. proposed to be constructed at 714-760 South Grand View Street in the City of

12 The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related

13 environmental documentation, as described below.

14 3. Parties

15 Petitioner Grand View Association is an

16 unincorporated association of tenants

17 of the existing Grand View Street Apartments, located at 714-760 Grand View

18 Street in Los Angeles (the Apartments), and their supporters. It was formed

19 20EYU after the City approved the Project on December 11, 2019, to protect the

4. environment and the character of the Westlake-MacArthur Park neighborhood
where the Project is proposed to be built.
Petitioner Alejandra M. Castro is a resident of the Apartments and a member

5. and one of the organizers of the Grand View Association. She has lived in the
Apartments her entire life.

25
26 Petitioners Grand View Association and Alejandra M. Castro will be referred to

27 jointly as Association in this petition. Association brings this action on its own

28 behalf and on behalf of the public. Association has a strong beneficial interest in

29 protecting the environment in the Westlake-MacArthur Park neighborhood,

30 and in Southern California generally. It brings this case because the actions

31 taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect it and the public directly as
residents of Southern California. Association is

33
34 Respondent City of Los Angeles, a charter city and municipal corporation, is

35 responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the City's territory,
including but not limited to implementing and complying with the provisions of
CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other California laws, and its own General Plan.

2 Respondent City is the lead agency for purposes of Public Resources Code

3 section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental

4 review for and approving the Project.
7.
5 Real Party in Interest Grandview Apartments, L.P. (Applicant) is limited

6 partnership with its principal place of business at 1149 S. Hill Street, Suite 700,

7 Los Angeles, C.A 90015. Applicant is the sole applicant identified for the Project,

LO ap and the recipient of Project approvals.

8. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real

10 Parties in Interest Does 1 through 10, and therefore sue those parties by such

11 fictitious names. Does through 10 are agents of Applicant who are responsible

12 in some manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or

13 entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in the subject matter of this

14 action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true names and

15 capacities of Does through 10 when such names and capacities become known.

17 Jurisdiction and Venue

9.
18 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code

19 of Civil Procedure (CCP) §§ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code

20 §S 21167, 21168, and 21168.5.

21 10. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within

22 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types

23 limited civil cases in CCP §$ 86, 86.1, or 87. of cases listed as

24 11. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP 394 because Respondent is a local

25 agency situated within Los Angeles County, which is where the Project's

26 environmental effects will be felt.

27 12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and

28 have exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

29 law.

31 General Allegations

32 The Project Site
33

34 13. The Project is proposed a to be built on a 0.88-acre site located at 714-760 Grand

35 View Street in the Westlake-MacArthur Park neighborhood of Los Angeles (the

2 Project Site).

3
4 14. Eighteen residential duplexes, containing a total of 36 dwelling units, currently

5 occupy the Project Site. On information and belief, about 85 persons currently
reside in these dwelling units (the Current Residents).

6 The Project
~J

9 15. The Applicant proposes to demolish the 18 duplexes on the Project Site and

10 construct a 6-story, 100-unit multi-family residential building, including a

11 market-rate manager's unit, 25 units restricted to Extremely Low Income
Households, and 74 units restricted to Low Income Households.

12
13 16. The Project will force the Current Residents to move elsewhere during Project

14 construction. Though the Applicant has offered to provide relocation assistance

15 to Current Residents, there is no guarantee that they will be able to find housing

16 nearby at a rent they can afford, and there is a likelihood that some of them will
become homeless as a result of the Project.

17

18 17. Association is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that some

19 Current Residents are not U.S. citizens or legal residents, and that some Current

20 Residents have bad credit or sufficient debt to make it difficult to rent housing.

48G Many Current Residents have incomes low enough that it is difficult for them to
find housing in the Westlake-MacArthur Park neighborhood.

24 18. Applicant stated during City hearings on the Project that the Current Residents
will have right to return once the Project is constructed. But the Applicant has

25 never guaranteed this right to return to all Current Residents in writing, and has

26 s at times during the approval process indicated that Current Residents' right to
return may be limited by a number of factors, including:

28
29 a. the amount of their debt, their bad debt, and the quality of their credit;
b. whether they are U.S. citizens;

C.

30
31 their history of evictions, and their standing with their landlord at the
time of return;

32
33 d. income limitations imposed by the covenants restricting occupation of

34 the units dedicated to Extremely Low Income and Low Income
Households; and

35 e, felony convictions.

19. Some Current Residents are likely to be deemed ineligible for return to the
2 Project under the criteria listed in the previous paragraph, and some of those
3 ineligible residents are likely to become homeless as a result.
4

5 Environmental Review and Project Approval

6 20. The Applicant applied for Project entitlements on July 17, 2018.
7 21. On July 24, 2019, the Los Angeles Director of Planning issued a Director's
8 Determination adopting a class-32 CEQA categorical exemption for the Project
9 and approving the following Project Entitlements:
10 a. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Affordable Housing Incentive
11 Program Compliance Review; and
12 b. Site Plan Review.
13

14 In support of the Project Entitlements, the Director adopted Conditions of

15 Approval and Findings.

16 22. On August 8, 2019, Petitioner Alejandra M. Castro appealed the Director's

17 Determination to the City Planning Commission.

18 23. On September 26, 2019, the Los Angeles City Planning Commission held a
19 public hearing on the Project and Ms. Castro's appeal, and voted to deny the
20 appeal and approve the Project and the CEQA Categorical Exemption.
21 24. On October 15, 2019, the City Planning Commission issued a Letter of
22 Determination, denying the appeal and approving the Project Entitlements and
23 the CEQA Categorical Exemption. The October 15, 2019, Letter of
24 Determination stated that the Project Entitlements were not further appealable,
25 but the Categorical Exemption could be appealed to the City Council.
26 25. On October 23, 2019, Alejandra M. Castro filed an appeal to the City Council of
27 the City Planning Commission's CEQA determination.
28 26. On December 10, 2019, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management
29

30 (PLUM) Committee, after holding a public hearing, voted to recommend that

31 the City Council deny the appeal and approve the Categorical Exemption for the
Project.
32
33 27. On December 11, 2019, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the

34 PLUM Committee, denying the appeal and approving the Categorical

35 Exemption for the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

28. On December 19, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Exemption (NOE) for the
Project with the Los Angeles City Clerk.

4 Los Angeles Housing Crisis and Homelessness
5 29. There is a shortage of housing, especially affordable housing, in the City of Los 6 Angeles and, particularly in the Westlake-MacArthur Park neighborhood where 7 the Project Site is located. This neighborhood is one of the densest in the City, 8 and is home to many low-income people. 9 30. The shortage of housing affordable to low-income residents is one of the main 10 contributors to the City's crisis of homelessness. The City's homeless population, 11
90 50 already very large, continues to grow.

First Cause of Action
Violation of Planning and Zoning Law
16 31. Petitioners incorporate gg 1-30 above as though set forth here.

17 32. The Planning and Zoning Law requires the City not to approve projects that are
inconsistent with the City's General Plan, which includes the Westlake 18 Community Plan, a portion of the General Plan that applies to the Project Site. 19 33. The City has abused its discretion by approving the Project in spite of significant 18 inconsistencies with the Westlake Community Plan, including but not limited to
the following inconsistencies with Chapter III, Land Use Policies and Programs,
Residential:
24 a. Objective 2 is "to conserve and improve existing viable housing for

25 persons desiring to live in Westlake, especially low and moderate income
26 families." [emphasis added.] Demolishing existing low-income housing is
27 inconsistent with this objective.
28 b. Policy 5 is that "the City shall discourage the demolition of affordable 29 housing unless there is adequate assurance that suitable equivalent
30 replacement units will be made available." The Project violates this policy
31 by allowing demolition of the Grand View Street Apartments without
32 ensuring that the replacement units will be "equivalent," or that they will
33 be made available to the Current Residents. The replacement housing will
34 not be equivalent because it will not be rent controlled, as the existing
35

-
2 housing is, and because some of the residents in the existing housing are

4 likely to be barred from living in the replacement units due to Applicant's
policies.

5

6 34. Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) $ 12.22 A.31, added to the LAMC by

7 Measure JJ] in 2016, governs the Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC)

8 incentives the City awarded to the Project. LAMC $ 12.22 A.31(e) requires the

9 Department of City Planning (Department) to follow the procedures listed in

10 LAMC $ 12.22 A.25(g) when deciding whether to award TOC incentives.

11 35. LAMC § 12.22 A.25(g) prohibits the Department from approving TOC

12 incentives when "the Incentive will have a Specific Adverse Impact upon public

13 health and safety or the physical environment…and for which there is no feasible

14 method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the Specific Adverse Impact without

15 rendering the development unaffordable to Very Low, Low and Moderate

16 Income households.' LAMC $ 12.22 A.25(b) defines "Specific Adverse Impact" as

17 *a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective,

18 identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions....'

19 36. The Project will have: Specific Adverse Impact upon health and safety in this

20 case because it will force some of the current residents of the Grand View Street

21 Apartments to move out of those apartments without any assurance they can find

22 housing they can afford. Some of them may end up homeless as a result. This

23 a potential homelessness is a health and safety impact.

24 37. The City abused its discretion by approving the Project's TOC incentives when

25 the Project will have Specific Adverse Impacts upon health and safety.

4 8 27 Second Cause of Action

28 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

29 38. Petitioners incorporate 9g 1-30 as though set forth here.

30 39. In approving the Categorical Exemption for the Project, the City violated the

31 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code

32 §S 21000-21189.3, and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000-

33 15387 plus appendices) in significant ways, which are set forth in the following
paragraphs.

34

35 40. On December 11, 2019, the City approved a class-32, "infill development-
project" categorical exemption for the Project. One of the requirements for the

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

}

00NOUAW N exemption, under CEQA Guidelines 15332(a), is that the Project be
"consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations." As alleged above in connection with the previous claim, the Project
does not meet this requirement because:
a. The Project is inconsistent with the Westlake Community Plan, including
Chapter III, Objective 2 and Policy 5; and

10 b. The Project has Specific Adverse Impacts upon health and safety, and is
therefore inconsistent with LAMC $ 12.22 A.25(g), part of the City's

11 zoning regulations.

12

13 41. CEQA Guidelines $ 15300.2(b) contains three exceptions that apply to the

14 Project and therefore prohibit the use of a categorical exemption in this case:

a.

15 Cumulative Impacts: There are numerous other approved housing

16 projects in the vicinity of the Project, which contribute towards

17 significant climate-change, air-quality, traffic, homelessness, and noise

18 impacts. The Project's contribution to these impacts is cumulatively
considerable.

19

20 b. Unusual Circumstances: The eviction of all of the Project Site's Current

21 Residents, with no guaranteed right of return, constitutes an unusual

22 circumstance because most infill projects do not result in the eviction of
23 residents living on the project site. Some of the tenants will have difficulty

24 obtaining housing following their eviction and are likely to become

25 homeless as a result. Homelessness is an environmental impact under

26 CEQA because it has direct impacts upon the physical environment in the

27 City. The impact in this case will be significant.

C.
28 Historical Resources (§ 15300.2(b)): The 18 duplexes, each containing two

29 dwelling units, currently on the Project Site constitute historical

30 resource, and the Project will cause a significant adverse change in their

31 significance.

a.
5 directing the City to set aside and vacate its approval of the Categorical

6 Exemption for the Project;

8 including the Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing

9 Incentive Program Compliance Review, the Site Plan Review, and the

10 associated Conditions of Approval and Findings; and

11 C. ordering the City and the Applicant to cease any and all activity related to

12 the Project that may result in a physical change to the environment unless
13 and until the Project is modified so that it is consistent with the applicable

14 general plan and zoning, and is re-approved following the adoption of a

15 legally sufficient CEQA document for the Project;

16 2. For costs of suit;

17 3. For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure $ 1021.5 and other
18 provisions of law; and
