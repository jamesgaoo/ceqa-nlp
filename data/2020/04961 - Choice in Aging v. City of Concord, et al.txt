23 INTRODUCTION
24 1. Petitioner CHOICE IN AGING ("CIA" or "Petitioner") challenges the approvals made
25 on January 14, 2020 by the City of Concord and City of Concord City Council (collectively,
26 "Respondent" or "Respondents") for the use permit and design and site review (PL19028-UP, DR) for
27 a project located at 1465 Civic Court in Concord, California with Contra Costa County APNs 126-300-
28 030 and -047 ("Project"). The Project is also known as "a PACE center" which stands for Program of •

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. The Project is located in in the City of Concord's downtown master

2 plan area. Respondents' associated actions for the Project's approval fail to adequately disclose and

3 analyze the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.

4 2. CIA alleges that the foregoing actions violate the California Environmental Quality Act,

5 Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code

6 of Regulations, §15000 et seq., violate Respondent's Municipal Code and Development Code, and are
7 inconsistent with the Respondent's General Plan. CIA seeks a determination from this Court that

8 Respondents' approval of the Project and related actions is invalid and void, fail to satisfy the
9 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and violate the Respondent's own laws and plans.

10 3. Approval of the Project is inconsistent with applicable plans, including the City's

11 General Plan and General Plan Update and associated Environmental Impact Reports (2006 and 2012).

12 The Project would have environmental impacts that have been inadequately analyzed and discussed

13 relating to traffic, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions, along with cumulatively considerable
14 impacts in the same areas. The Project is also inconsistent with the CEQA Air Quality Guidelines
15 adopted by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD).

16 4. Petitioner respectfully petitions this Court for a peremptory writ of mandate, pursuant to

17 Code of Civil Procedure §1094.5 and Public Resources Code §21168 (or in the alternative, Code of

18 Civil Procedure §1085 and Public Resources Code §§21168.5) and Public Resources Code $21168.9

19 that (1) directs the City of Concord and the Concord City Council to void the adoption the Resolution
20 approving the Use Permit and Design and Site Review; (2) directs the Respondents to comply with the
21 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. and other state and local
22 laws; (3) prohibits the Respondent from approving any further permits or contracts furthering the

23 Project pending completion of a legally adequate environmental review; and (4) directs Respondents to

24 take whatever other action is necessary to ensure that any future action related to the Project and

25 associated environmental review of the same will be in conformance with CEQA.

26 PARTIES

27 5. CHOICE IN AGING ("CIA") is a nonprofit corporation. CIA is based in Pleasant Hill

28 and has been conducting business in the local area, including serving Concord residents, since 1949.

2
CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

CIA's interests include, but are not limited to, aesthetic and environmental resources of the area near to

2 the Project. CIA's employees and customers regularly and routinely travel in the vicinity of the Project

3 location.

4 6. The environmental interests of CIA and CIA's employees and customers have been and

5 will be adversely affected by the Project.

6 7. CIA and its employees have expressed particular concern for the environment in which

7 they live and/or work, including but not limited to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, land use,

8 aesthetics, and protection of the area from growth-inducing impacts as well as concern over procedural

9 fairness and even application of the law.

10 8. CIA has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply

11 with laws relating to environmental protection and CIA is adversely affected by Respondents' failure to

12 comply with CEQA for the Project. CIA's aesthetic, common, and private property interests will be

13 injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other

14 environmental laws. CIA brings this petition in the public interest on behalf of all others similarly

15 situated who are too numerous to be named and brought before this court as Petitioner. CIA

16 participated in the administrative processes herein and has exhausted its administrative remedies.

17 Additionally, CIA has notified the Attorney General for the State of California, in compliance with

18 CEQA.

19 9. Respondent, City of Concord, is a governing body and municipal corporation exercising

20 local government power. The Respondent is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency

21 for the Project, the Respondent is responsible for environmental review that describes and analyzes the

22 Project and its impacts and evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any

23 significant environmental impacts.

24 10. City of Concord City Council is the Respondent's final decision-making body, which

25 adopted a Resolution purporting to approve the Project on or about January 14, 2020. Respondent, City

26 Council, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the City of Concord.

27 11. CIA is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as Does 1-10.

28 CIA is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does 1-10, inclusive, are

3

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the Project or by the Respondent's

2 actions with respect to the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have

3 been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such

4 identities and capacities.

5 12. Real Party in Interest, Center for Elders' Independence ("Real Party in Interest" or

6 "RPI"), is a nonprofit corporation and the recipient of Respondents' relevant approvals for the proposed

7 Project.

8 13. RPI has title, right, or interest in real property commonly identified as APN126-300-030

9 and -047, with the common street address of 1465 Civic Court ("Property"), which is the location for

10 the subject Project approvals at issue here.

11 14. CIA is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest identified as

12 Does 8-20. CIA is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does 8-20,

13 inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the Project or by the

14 County's actions with respect to the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these Real

15 Parties in Interest have been determined, CIA will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition

16 to insert such identities and capacities.

17 BACKGROUND FACTS

18 15. On or about April 10, 2018, City staff was approached by RPI representatives regarding

19 an adult day care center use at the Property with an "i]nterest in buying [the] existing office building
20 and creating [an] adult day care business with medical clinic component". At that time, Respondent

21 indicated to RPI an adult day care center use was only allowable in combination with residential use.

22 16. After subsequent discussions with RPI representatives and reviewing additional

23 documents, the Respondent originally classified RPI's proposed use as a medical clinic under the
24 zoning ordinance.

25 17. In or about June of 2018, after RPI submitted additional information regarding its

26 proposed use and the services to be provided at the subject Property, Respondent changed RPI's use

27 classification under the zoning ordinance from medical clinic to social services facility.

28 18. On or about February 5, 2019, RPI submitted an application to the Respondent for a

4

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Minor Use Permit to "convert office space on the ground floor of the [two adjacent commercial office

2 buildings] into a Social Services Center for the Elderly". The second floor of the buildings was

3 proposed to remain as existing office uses. No residential use was proposed at the site.

4 19. Counsel for CIA provided the City with Notice of Representation and Notice of

5 Interested Party on behalf of CIA in correspondence dated February 12, 2019, seeking "timely notice of

6 any action to be taken or decision to be considered by staff or any advisory or governing body

7 regarding [RPI]'s proposed project." City staff thereafter advised Counsel for CIA to track updates on
8 RPI's proposed Project on the City's Citizen Access Portal (found on the City's website).

9 20. On or about February 19, 2019, the Respondent's Development Advisory Committee
10 ("DAC") conducted a completeness review of the Project and staff determined the Project was
11 incomplete. Respondent provided a letter of incompleteness to RPI on March 5, 2019.
12 21. On or about June 11, 2019, RPI submitted revised plans and an application for
13 Administrative Design and Site Review.
14 22. On or about May 28, 2019, Respondent City Council approved amendments to the
15 Concord Development Code ("CDC") with regards to certain medical-related land use classifications,
16 including adding a new use classification of "medical services facility" and amending the definition of
17 "social services facility".

18 23. On or about June 25, 2019, the Respondent's DAC conducted a completeness review of
19 the Project application materials, and staff determined the project application was again incomplete as
20 indicated in correspondence dated July 10, 2019.
21 24. In or about late July of 2019, the above-referenced amendments to the CDC became
22 effective. Sometime thereafter, the City reclassified RPI's proposed use from a social services facility
23 to medical services facility which required a use permit and review by the Planning Commission.
24 25. On or about August 12, 2019, RPI again submitted project plans to address the design

25 review portion of the required site improvements.
26 26. On or about September 6, 2019, a third incomplete letter was provided to RPI, noting the
27 outstanding items still due from the earlier incompleteness letter.
28 27. On or about September 13, 2019, RPI resubmitted their application along with a written

5

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

statement.

2 28. On October 4, 2019, the Respondent deemed the project application of RPI complete.

3 29, However, Respondents did not provide CIA with further updates regarding the progress

4 01 status of RPI's proposed Project, beginning in at least July of 2019 and for some months thereafter,

5 especially as the Citizen Access Portal continued to provide incomplete and inaccurate information

6 regarding the Project. Despite the above-referenced notice of representation/interested party, City staff

7 did not provide CIA's counsel with notice of any subsequent action or decision considered by staff or

8 any advisory or governing body regarding RPI's proposed project, including: the reclassification of the
9 proposed project/use to a medical services facility, the shift from a minor use permit to a use permit to
10 be reviewed by the Planning Commission, and the determination that the project application was finally
11 deemed complete in or about October 4, 2019.

12 30. The public hearing on RPI's application for a Use Permit and Design and Site Review

13 pertaining to the Project was originally scheduled for November 6, 2019 before the City of Concord's
14 Planning Commission. However, Respondent had failed to provide the required 10-day advance written
15 notice to CIA, as an interested party who requested such notice of the public hearing, pursuant to CDC
16 §18.500.020(B)(1)(d). As a result, the Planning Commission continued the public hearing to November
17 20, 2019.

18 31. On or about November 20, 2019, the Planning Commission heard the matter and then
19 conditionally approved a Use Permit and Design and Site Review for RPI's Project - approving the
20 PACE Center Use Permit and Design and Site Review for occupation of 16,050 square feet of the
21 ground floor of two existing adjacent commercial office buildings.

22 32. On or about December 2, 2019, CIA filed a timely appeal of the Planning Commission's
23 November 20, 2019 approval of the Use Permit and Design and Site Review.
24 33. On or about January 14, 2020, the matter came on for hearing before Respondent City

25 Council which adopted a Resolution "Denying the Appeal of the Planning Commission's Adoption of
26 Resolution No. 19-20 PC and Approving the Center for Elders' Independence PACE Center for Seniors
27 Use Permit and Design and Site Review (PL19028 - UP, DR) located at 1465 Civic Court, APNs 126-
28 300-030 and -047, Subject to Conditions of Approval."

6

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. On or about January 15, 2020, Respondents filed and posted a Notice of Exemption.

2 35. This action has been brought within thirty-five (35) days of the filing of the Notice of

3 Exemption, as required by Public Resources Code §21167(c).

4 36. On or about February 18, 2020, before the commencement of this action, Petitioner

5 served written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the

6 requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.5.

7 37. On or about February 19, 2020, Petitioner notified the Attorney General of the State of

8 California of the filing of this petition and furnished him with a copy of the petition in accordance with
9 the requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.7.

10 38. The action of the Respondents in approving the Project, and purporting to comply with

11 CEQA constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion, because Respondents failed to proceed in a manner

12 required by law, failed to make findings that are supported by substantial evidence, made findings that

13 are not supported by the evidence, proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction, and failed to provide

14 Petitioner a fair hearing before the Respondent City Council.

15 39. Respondents and/or RPI are threatening to proceed with construction and actions on the
16 Project in the near future. Construction of the Project will result in irreparable harm to the information
17 requirements of CEQA to disclose impacts and avoid or mitigate significant impacts of the Project to

18 traffic, greenhouse gases, and air quality impacts. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and
19 permanent injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and RPI from proceeding with the Project.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 40. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

22 Civil Procedure §1094.5 and Public Resources Code §21168. In the alternative, this Court has
23 jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procodure §1085 and Public Resources Code $21168.5.

24 41. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in

25 and for the County of Contra Costa, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $394.

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•i I. VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

2 Respondents' Claimed CEQA Exemptions Do Not Apply to this Project

3 50. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its discretion

4 because Respondents made determinations that are not supported or supportable by the California

5 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code $21000 et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to its

6 findings of exemptions.

7 51. Respondents determined that the Project was subject to, but exempt from CEQA.

8 However, the proposed Project is not appropriate for any of the claimed categorical exemptions.
9 52. Respondents' findings are not supported by substantial evidence in determining that the
10 exemptions are applicable in this case because potentially significant impacts and impacts are not

11 mitigated, the Project expands the existing use, the Project is not consistent with the applicable general
12 plan and zoning ordinance, and the Project is not categorically (or otherwise) exempt from CEQA.
13 53. In addition to the exemptions not applying, even if they did apply, the exception to the

14 exemptions applies. Here, there is a reasonable possibility that an activity will have a significant effect

15 on the environment due to "unusual circumstances." As such, Respondents may not find that the

16 activity is categorically exempt from CEQA (CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(c)). Here, there are unusual
17 circumstances that include but are not limited to the significant and unavoidable traffic problems in the

18 vicinity of the Project as well as idling vehicles and increase in local traffic next to the sensitive

19 receptors of the youth at the adjacent youth-oriented amusement park.
20 B. Respondents Failed to Provide a Meaningful and Consistent Project Description,
21 Comply with CEQA's Requirements for Disclosure, Analysis, and/or Mitigation, and
Require an Initial Study Despite Evidence of Potentially Significant Impacts
22

23 54. Respondents failed to provide a meaningful and consistent Project description from

24 which decisionmakers and the public can fully understand the proposed Project's potentially significant

25 impacts (CEQA Guidelines §15064). For example, the Project materials failed to provide important
26 information to adequately inform the decisionmakers and the public about the Project's impacts with

27 respect to vehicle trips and vehicle miles travelled (CEQA Guidelines §15064.3).

28 55. Nor did the Project materials adequately disclose the myriad of existing unattainment

9

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

. problems with the local air quality. This is particularly relevant for this proposed Project due to the
2 disproportionate impacts on the elderly, who are sensitive receptors and involved with the Project.

3 56.

4 Respondents fail to disclose the number of participants/other individuals that will be on

5 site at any given time because the number chosen (seventy) is arbitrary and unsupported by facts.

57.

6 The Project description is inconsistent with respect to food preparation being both onsite
and offsite with no clear delineation of either.

7 58.

8 The Project will cause potentially significant direct physical changes in the environment,

9 or reasonably foresceable indirect physical changes in the environment such as to noise, traffic, air

10 quality/greenhouse gases, cumulatively considerable impacts that Respondents are required to disclose

11 and analyze prior to its approval of the Project. Respondents failed to do this.

59.

12 There is a fair argument based on substantial evidence that the proposed Project may

13 cause potentially significant impacts to traffic/circulation, air quality/greenhouse gases, noise and to

14 cumulatively considerable impacts (CEQA Guidelines §15162).

60.

15 By adding additional traffic to the area with the newly proposed Project, the proposed

16 Project will exacerbate existing traffic, noise, air quality/greenhouse gas, and cumulatively considerable

impacts.

17 61. The Project will exceed thresholds of significance and conflict with the local plans and
18 mandatory levels of service related to traffic congestion inclúding plans related to alternative
19 transportation.

20 62.

21 This Project may have potentially significant transportation/traffic impacts, because it is

22 located in areas surrounded by levels of service of F on both the nearby freeways and roadways. This is

23 especially so, given the Project site has a number of vectors from which it will contribute to traffic

24 circulation problems. It will further exacerbate traffic problems such that they are significant and

25 unavoidable. As such, the Respondent leaders must go on record and acknowledge/disclose and then

26 analyze the potentially significant traffic impacts of this proposed Project.

63.

27 In addition to the harmful location for seniors, the Project has peculiar impacts related to

28 idling vehicles as loading and unloading seniors is part of the Project description. Here, the Project
would expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations, which is another reason the

10
CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

b

e Project must have an Initial Study.

2 64.

3 There is substantial evidence of noise impacts near the Project site - from traffic, from

4 construction and from cumulatively considerable impacts to the Project's participants, visitors, and

5 employees, as well as to the adjacent residential neighborhoods. Notably, the Project is located adjacent

6 to a major amusement park with other peak noise events. See the Supplemental EIR to the 2030

7 Concord General Plan EIR (2012 SEIR") and the General Plan Update EIR (*2006 EIR"). Increased

8 traffic corresponds with increase in traffic noise, thereby exceeding the applicable threshold of 60 dB.

65.

9 The Project proposes to locate the elderly, who are sensitive receptors, to substantial

10 pollutant concentrations. The Project exceeds the thresholds set forth in Appendix G of the CEQA

11 Guidelines for exposure to sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations, as this Project
does here.

12 66.

13 The Bay Arca Air Basin Attainment Status identifies several pollutants for which the

14 Bay Area has non-attainment status under State Status and or Federal Status for: Ozone, PM10, and
PM2.5. (Bay Area Air Quality Management District, 2010.)

15 67. Based on the non-attainment status, the Project must disclose and analyze its further
16 contribution to the non-attainment.

17 68.

18 The Project fails to adequately disclose and analyze the significance of impacts from

19 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (CEQA Guidelines §15064.4 (a)(1)) by ignoring the analysis required, but

20 missing, pertaining to vehicle miles travelled and commensurate impacts to air quality and greenhouse
gas impacts.

21 69.

22 The proposed Project may have potentially significant cumulatively considerable
impacts to traffic, air quality, greenhouse gases, and noise.

23 70.

24 Respondents acknowledge significant increase in daily car trips, but refuses to study that

25 problem. Additionally, the Project fails to require the fair share cost to a regional fee program to fund

26 improvements on the adjacent freeway system, as required by the 2012 SEIR.
71.

27 Moreover, the 2012 SEIR sets forth that even with such mitigation of fair share paying
the impact will remain significant and unavoidable.

28 72. Respondents must perform an Initial Study that discloses and analyzes the potentially

11

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-,

2 significant impacts from cumulatively considerable impacts and analyze the mandatory finding of
significance related thereto.

3 73.

4 In addition, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law in approving a

5 Project that is inconsistent with the local land use planning, general plan, and the zoning ordinance.

74. Respondents failed to require an Initial Study to adequately analyze those
6 inconsistencies. Because there is a fair argument that the Project may have potentially significant

7 impacts, it is not suitable, as Respondents claim, for an exemption.

8 75.

9 The environmental review fails to comply with CEQA's requirements for disclosure,

10 analysis, and/or mitigation of the Project's potentially significant impacts in the areas of air quality,

11 greenhouse gas emissions, inadequate alternatives analysis, inadequate mitigation, land use, aesthetics,

12 and growth-inducing impacts. The environmental review fails to adequately identify, discuss, and

13 mitigate or avoid all of the Project's potentially significant impacts and environmental effects in the
above-referenced areas.

14 76.

15 The Project description fails to inform the decision makers and the public of potentially
significant impacts.

16 77.

17 The Respondent must provide a complete and stable Project description, conduct an
Initial Study, and re-circulate the proposed Project for public comment.

18 78. The Respondent must conduct an Initial Study because of the potentially significant
19 impacts of the proposed Project as a whole and because it is not subject to any exemptions.
20 c.
21 Respondents Failed to Make the Necessary Findings Regarding Significant and
Unavoidable Impacts Supported by the Evidence

22 79.

23 Respondents were required by CEQA to determine in written findings whether each of

24 the Project's impacts are significant or not, and whether any significant effects can be avoided. With

respect to

25 any significant environmental effects which could not be avoided or mitigated, Respondents

26 were further required by Guidelines §15091 to make findings that the mitigation measures necessary to

27 reduce project impacts are either (1) solely within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public

28 agency which can and should adopt those measures, or (2) are made infeasible, along with any
alternatives which could reduce impacts, by specific economic, social or other consideration. In such

12
CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 circumstances, Guidelines §§15092 and 15093 further require Respondents to find that the benefits of

3 the proposed project outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects. Here, Respondents failed

4 to identify impacts to traffic, air quality, and to greenhouse gases such that the public and decision-

5 makers cannot meaningfully weigh the purported social and economic benefits of the Project against
the unknown impacts.

6 80.

7 In addition, the Project is located in an area with significant and unavoidable impacts.

8 See 2012 SEIR and 2006 EIR. As such, the Respondent City Council was required to, but failed to go
on record and likewise make the necessary findings related to the significant and unavoidable impacts
9 related to traffic, noise, and cumulative impacts for this proposed Project.
10 D.
11 Respondents Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion
by Failing to Make Findings Supported by the Evidence

12 81.

13 Respondents' actions in approving the Project constitute an abuse of discretion in

14 addressing the above-described subjects, are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and

15 fail to comply with CEQA and CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, Respondents' actions are invalid
because Respondents failed to make

16 limited to, the following: proper written findings as required by CEQA, including, but not

17 a.

18 The findings are conclusory, internally inconsistent, and fail to bridge the analytic gap

19 between the raw evidence and the findings, including but not limited to Respondents' findings
regarding the community's alleged need for this Project.

20 b.

21 Respondents' determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA is not supported by
substantial evidence.

22 C.

23 Respondents' findings related to their claims that CEQA exemptions apply and that

24 there are no exceptions to the CEQA exemptions are not supported by substantial evidence, including

25 such findings that there will be no significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water

26 quality; that there is no possibility that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment;

27 and that the Project will not have a significant effect on the environment due to a cumulative impact of
other projects or unusual circumstances.

28 82. The Project's administrative record reflects an inadequate consideration of mitigation

13

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

measures. Guidelines §15092(b) provides that a public agency shall not approve or carry out a project

2 which has one or more significant environmental effects unless it has "[e]liminated or substantially

3 lessened all significant effects on the environment where feasible.* The discussion of mitigation

4 measures is inadequate in numerous respects, including but not limited to the following:

5 a. The administrative proceedings and associated documents fail to include any evaluation

6 of the likelihood that the mitigation measures for traffic impacts, air quality impacts, and greenhouse

7 gases will mitigate for the Project's impacts. Accordingly, there is not substantial evidence that the

8 mitigation necessary to bring impacts to traffic, air quality and greenhouse gases to less than significant

9 will occur.

10 b. The Project conflicts with applicable local land use plans, policies, or regulations

11 (including, but not limited to the general plan, and zoning ordinance) that are adopted for the purpose

12 of avoiding or mitigating environmental effects.

13 83. The Project's maximum number of participants promised to be onsite at any given time
14 is unenforceable. The Project proponent RPI and the Respondent claim that there will only be seventy
15 (70) PACE participants on site at any given time. The Respondent asserts, without substantial evidence
16 in support, that each participant will visit 2-3 times per week. It is impossible to follow Respondent's

17 analytical route. There is a fair argument that there are potentially significant impacts and an Initial
18 Study is required for analysis and necessary disclosures.
19 84. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under
20 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and have decided the
21 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the approval of the
22 Project must be set aside.
23 85. Respondents' failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA renders the

24 environmental review inadequate as a matter of law and requires that Respondents' approval of the

25 Project must be set aside.

26 86. Unless Petitioner is granted injunctive relief, it will suffer irreparable harm in that the

27 implementation of the Project will cause permanent harm to Petitioner and will create adverse

28 environmental impacts previously described in this Petition, to the detriment of Petitioner and other

14
CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

• similarly situated.

2 87. Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy at law because monetary damages cannot be

3 ascertained and Petitioner and its members cannot be compensated for the environmental degradation

4 caused by this Project.

5 II. VIOLATIONS OF CONCORD MUNICIPAL CODE AND DEVELOPMENT CODE

88. Petitioner incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though they were set forth

7 in full herein.

8 A. Respondents Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion by Not Following the Law

9 1. The Required Neighborhood Meeting Did Not Take Place

10 89. Respondent City failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it failed to

11 enforce the requirement under Respondent City's Development Code ("CDC) whereby applicants

12 shall conduct a neighborhood meeting. Per CDC §18.405.060, a neighborhood meeting is required after

13 submitting a preliminary or formal application to Planning Division and shall be required for the

14 following projects that require discretionary approval, including: (1) all infill residential projects;

15 (2) projects located within 300 feet of a residential district; (3) complex projects with multiple

16 applications; (4) potentially controversial projects; or (5) uses that have the potential to affect

17 surrounding properties. Because the Project meets the above-referenced criteria set forth in (3), (4),

18 and/or (5) as detailed herein, the neighborhood meeting should have been required under the CDC.

19 90. The City's handout entitled "Public Notification Process for Public Hearings and
20 Neighborhood Meetings" explains that

21 One of the most important steps in the notification process is communicating
22 the specific details of a project to the residents, property owners, and business operators in the vicinity of the project. The City requires project applicants to
23 organize and hold a neighborhood meeting within thirty days after submittal of

24 any application a that requires a public hearing. This is very important because it is your opportunity to provide accurate information to the neighbors about the
25 proposed project before project details are finalized, and it allows the neighbors to get more involved in the project as well.

-• 91.

2 This handout further explains that "City staff is responsible for: [a]ssisting the applicant

3 in organizing neighborhood meeting; [p]roviding notices and mailing the notice to all property or

4 business owners and all tenants within the notification area; [and a]ttending the neighborhood
meeting."

5 92.

6 No such required neighborhood meeting took place for this Project nor did the City

7 comply with its responsibilities associated with this neighborhood meeting requirement. Therefore,

8 RPI's proposed neighbors were precluded from receiving accurate information about the Project before

9 the details were finalized as well as from being able to get more involved in the Project.

10 2. Respondents Failed to Comply with its Appeal Process Set Forth
in its Municipal Code

11 93. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated its own
12 Municipal Code when it failed to comply with Concord Municipal Code ("CMC") §2.05.040(4), which

13

14 indicates that "[t]he City Clerk shall place the matter of the notice of appeal on the agenda of the

15 meeting of the City Council, the preparation of which agenda immediately follows filing notice of

16 appeal." CMC $2.05.040(5) further states that the "City Council shall determine when a notice of

17 appeal is in order and, if it so finds, shall set the time and the place of public hearing and may provide
for special notice in addition to what is herein set forth...".

18 94.

19 Respondents failed to comply with all of the requirements of CMC §2.05.040 to perfect
an appeal to the City Council where notice to the general public is required as Respondents failed to
20 I place notice of CIA's Appeal (filed on December 2, 2019) on the agenda for the City Council's next

21

22 meeting that followed filing of CIA's notice of appeal, which should have been on December 10, 2019,

SO

23 that the City Council could determine if the notice of appeal was in order and then set the time and
place of public hearing for CIA's Appeal.

24 95.

25 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by allowing the City

26 Manager, instead of the City Council, to set the hearing for January 14, 2020 for the City Council
without the City Council's review of the notice of appeal.

27 96.

28 Respondents abused their discretion because they did not follow their own code and did

16
CHOICE IN AGING Y. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-. not uniformly apply the law.

2 B.

3 The City Council Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion Because Its Findings Are Not Supported by the Evidence

4 1.

5 The Evidence Does Not Support the Findings Required for Respondents to
Approve the Use Permit

6 97.

7 According to CDC §18.435.060(A), "[t]he review authority may approve a ..use permit

8 application only after first making" certain findings as listed in CDC $18.435.060(A)(1)-(5).

98.

9 Respondent City Council committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when it made the

10 finding under CDC $18.435.060(A)(1) that the Project's proposed use is allowed within the Downtown

11 Mixed-Use ("DMX") zoning district and complies with all other applicable provisions of the CDC and
CMC because the evidence does not support such finding.

12 99.

13 Moreover, "[w]hen a conditional use permit is obtained, the permittee may make those

14 uses of the property authorized by the zoning ordinance in the absence of a permit and in addition those

15 uses authorized by the permit. But the conditional use permit does not permit uses authorized neither by

16 the permit nor by the zoning ordinance without permit. Thus, the use permitted is both a grant of

17 authority to use and a limitation on the authorized uses of the property."2

18 100. a. Adult day care use is not allowed in the DMX District without residential use

19 RPI's proposed "PACE" Center involves a use that is not allowed in the Downtown

20 Mixed-Use ("DMX"*) zoning district. Table in CDC §18.45.020 provides that an adult day care use in

21 the DMX district is allowed only in combination with residential use, subject to an administrative
permit.

22 101. However, no such residential use is involved here.

23 102.

24 Under CDC §18.20.020, "adult day care center" is defined as "a state-licensed facility

25 that provides nonmedical care and supervision for dependent adult clients for periods of less than 24
hours for any client.3

26 103.

27 Notably, RPI's PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) center is defined

28 Sports Arenas Properties v. City of San Diego (1985) 40 Cal.3d 808, 815.

17
CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 under §460.6 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") as "a facility which includes a

2 primary care clinic, areas for therapeutic recreation, restorative therapies, socialization, personal care,

3 and dining, and which serves as the focal point for coordination and provision of most PACE services."

4 §460.98(c) of Title 42 of the CFR further explains that at a minimum, the following services must be

5 furnished at each PACE Center: (1) Primary care, including services furnished by a primary care

6 provider…and nursing services; (2) Social services; (3) Restorative therapies, including physical

7 therapy and occupational therapy; (4) Personal care and supportive services; (5) Nutritional counseling;

8 (6) Recreational therapy; and (7) Meals.

9 b. RPI's proposed PACE center involves more than just a medical services facility

10 104. CDC §18.20.030 defines "primary use" as "the main purpose for which a site is a

11 developed and occupied" while "ancillary" means "a facility or use that is subordinate to the primary

12 use but not required or necessary." (Emphasis added.) These definitions are important because, in
13 general, to qualify as a PACE Center certain services and uses, including adult day care, are required;

14 therefore, they cannot be considered ancillary.

15 105. Here, however, given the actual services and uses involved with RPI's proposed

16 "PACE" Center and RPI's own references to adult day care and "day-center" uses, the assertions and

17 findings that such use at the Property should be classified solely as a "medical services facility" use are

18 erroneous, inaccurate, and not supported by the record.

19 106. In April of 2018, RPI presented its proposed use at the Property as an adult day care

20 center as it indicated an "interest in buying [the] existing office building and creating [an] adult day
21 care business with medical clinic component" and City staff indicated that adult day care use is only
22 allowable when combined with residential use. Later, after the City first classified RPI's proposed use

23 at the Property as a medical clinic, RPI explained in a letter to the City's Planning Division dated April

24 23, 2018 that they believed that the proposed use fits more under the "social service facility,
25 community organization" land use classification.

26 107. Eventually, in June of 2018, the City changed RPI's use classification from medical

27 clinic to social services facility after RPI provided additional information about its proposed services to

28 be provided at the Property.

18

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 108. Despite the City reclassifying RPI's proposed use of the Property as a social services

2 facility in June of 2018, RPI continued to refer to its proposed use for adult day care. For example, its

3 December 5, 2018 Lot Merger Application states that they are "in process of repurposing the ground

4 floors of both buildings into an adult day care facility and clinic." (Emphasis added.) RPI
5  representatives have described in public settings that the proposed center is for adult day care. RPI has

6 also promoted and emphasized that its PACE Centers substantially have an adult day care center use.3

7 109. RPI's resubmitted plans for their minor use permit/design and site development review

8 applications also continue to reference "Day-center". In its design and site review application, it also

9 states that: "The component parts of the project are activity rooms, behavioral health, rehabilitation,

10 clinic, and support/admin areas."

11 110. The City's Planning Division's July 10, 2019 correspondence, which indicated that

12 RPI's applications were deemed incomplete, also notified RPI representatives again that adult day care

13 center use is not allowed in the DMX district without residential use and then instructed them to

14 remove other references to "Day-center".

15 111. Adult day care center activities are a prominent use in RPI's proposed "PACE" Center
16 as one of the two buildings has been designated on the plans as "Daycenter" and the large amount of

17 floor square footage designated just for the Day Center alone (which does not account for the other

18 areas of that building: administrative, support, and 3,280 square feet of hallways/stairwells)

19 112. The descriptions and references of RPI's proposed uses for "day center" and the

20 previous references to "adult day care center" use mentioned above fit the CDC definition set forth

21 above as such activities include nonmedical care and supervision for PACE Center participants, who

22 are brought to the PACE Center for periods of less than 24 hours.

23 c. The other required services and uses at RPI's proposed PACE Center cannot be
24 overlooked and the standards for such uses still need to be met

25 113. The contemplated use permit to operate a medical services facility at the Property does

26

27 3 Notably, RPI's San Leandro PACE Center has been described as having adult day care services. See e.g., information on the City of San Leandro's Citizen Portal website providing information on RPI's adult day care
28 project and page 15 of RPI's attachment for Item 4.A to the agenda for the April 3, 2017 San Leandro City Council meeting regarding RPI's presentation to the City Council.

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIBD PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 not account for all of the other intended, and required, uses and services that is proposed to be provided

2 at RPI's Proposed "PACE" Center.

3 114. Considering that RPI has continuously presented and referenced the proposed 'PACE"

4 Center in Concord as an adult day care center, or at the very least, provided description of activities that

5 constitute adult day care center use, the City was in error by finding that RPI's proposed use of the

6 Property as both an adult day care center and medical services facility complies with the CDC, which

7 specifically precludes adult day care center use in the DMX district unless combined with residential..

8 115. In addition to the state-licensing required for certain services provided at PACE Centers,

9 the above-referenced requirements for a PACE Center also involve activities and services that indicate

10 non-medical care and supervision, including: social services, recreational therapy, and meals. It was

11 also indicated that RPI's proposed "PACE" Center will provide such services at its "Daycenter" as

12 social activities and daily hot meals.

13 116. Also, adult day care center use at RPI's proposed "PACE" Center is a completely a

14 different and separate use from medical services facility use, especially since adult day care center use

15 involves nonmedical supervision and care, which does not fit under CDC $18.20.020's definition of

16 "medical services facility":

17 a facility, other than hospital, where medical, dental, mental health, surgical,
18 and/or other personal health care services are provided on an outpatient basis.
19 A medical services facility use would provide consultation, diagnosis, therapeutic,
preventative or corrective treatment services by doctors, dentists, chiropractors,
20 counselors, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, acupuncturists, psychiatrists,
21 psychologists, and similar practitioners of medical and healing arts for humans

22 licensed for such practice by the state of California. This classification does not
include counseling services and other services provided by nonmedical or health
23 professionals (see "Offices, Professional" or "Social service facility"), massage

24 therapy (see "Personal Services, General" or "Personal Services, Restricted"),
and cannabis-related uses (see "Cannabis Uses").
25 117. The other contemplated services and activities at RPI's proposed "PACE" Center
26 triggered other use classifications that needed to be further addressed. This included adult day care
27 center use as well as some activities pertaining to food and eating establishment and/or social services
28 facility uses. For example, while it has been explained that meals for participants will be delivered to

20

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 the proposed "PACE" Center, there have also been references that cooking might take place onsite in
the future as participants share recipes and/or create a cookbook. a

3 118.

4 Because additional use classifications are triggered, the standards and requirements for

5 such uses still need to be met, especially as Respondents use permit as is is only for operating a medical
services facility.

6 119.

7 The evidence also does not support another required finding to approve the use permit
under CDC §18.435.060(A)(2) and the design and site review application under CDC
8 §18.415.100(A)(1) that the proposed use is consistent with the general plan. Therefore, Respondents
9 committed prejudicial abuse of discretion in approving RPI's use permit and the design and site review
10 application because the required findings are not supported by the evidence.

11 C. The City Committed Prejudicial Procedural Errors

12 120.
13 Counsel for CIA provided the City with Notice of Representation and Notice of

14 Interested Party on behalf of CIA in correspondence dated February 12, 2019 in order to obtain "timely

15 notice of any action to be taken or decision to be considered by staff or any advisory or governing body

16 regarding [RPI]'s proposed project". City staff advised Counsel for CIA to track updates on RPI's

17 proposed Project on the City's Citizen Access Portal (found on the City's website). However, The City

18 failed to provide accurate, complete, and timely information to CIA and the public about the Project.

121.

19 For example, although multiple actions and changes had occurred in the time period

20 after the City provided RPI with a second "incomplete letter" dated July 10, 2019 (including a change

21 in the use classification and use permit requirement for the Project, resubmittal of Project plans, and the

22 use permit/design and site review applications being deemed complete), the information on the Citizen

23 Access Portal was not updated even up until the November 20, 2019 Planning Commission public

24 hearing on the Project as the Citizen Access Portal had only listed the July 10, 2019 "incomplete letter"

25 as the last event and had still inaccurately described the Project as involving a minor use permit "to

26 convert office space into a Social Service Center for the elderly" rather than as a medical services
facility requiring a use permit.
27 122.

28 In addition, CIA did not have the opportunity to review the full record pertaining to
RPI's proposed Project in order to effectively prepare for the November 20, 2019 Planning

CHOICE IN AGING V. CITY OF CONCORD ET AL. 21

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Commission public hearing since the City did not provide responsive records to CIA's November 4,

2 2019 Public Records Act Request before such public hearing. This impacted CIA's, as well as the

3 public's, ability to conduct a more thorough and effective review and analysis of the Project for

4 comments at the November 20, 2019 Planning Commission public hearing.

5 123. Respondents also failed to enforce the CDC requirement for a neighborhood meeting

6 after RPI submitted its formal use permit/design and site review applications to the Planning Division.

7 Therefore, RPI's neighbors (including residents, property owners, and business operators in the vicinity

8 of the Project) were not afforded the opportunity to be informed about accurate information about the

9 proposed Project before project details were finalized nor were they allowed to get more involved in the
10 Project as well as discussed in the City's handout "Public Notification Process for Public Hearings and
11 •Neighborhood Meetings",.4

12 124. This overall lack of accurate, complete, and timely information regarding RPI's

13 proposed Project became a major issue, especially considering the significance of reclassifying the
14 Project, pursuant to recently passed CDC amendments under the new land use classification of a

15 "medical services facility" which required review by the Planning Commission, more individualized

16 scrutiny, and public hearing since a use permit was now involved rather than the previously determined

17 minor use permit for a social services facility.

18 125. Given the complexity of issues involved with this Project, public input should have also
19 been sought earlier in order to address any potential concerns and impacts of RPI's proposed Project.

20 126. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under

21 the Concord Municipal Code and Development Code, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a

22 manner required by law, have decided the matters complained of without the support of substantial
23 evidence, and have committed prejudicial procedural errors. Accordingly, the approval of the Project

24 must be set aside.
