INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Ventura County Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and Business,

2 Ventura County Agricultural Association, and Farm Bureau of Ventura County (collectively, the

3 "Coalition") bring this Verified Petition and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

4 (*Petition") against Respondents and Defendants County of Ventura and County of Ventura

5 Board of Supervisors (collectively, the "County"), alleging as follows:

6 I. INTRODUCTION

7 1. The Coalition files this Petition to protect the rights of its members, the

8 agriculture community throughout the County and the State, and the interests of the general

9 public in preserving the longstanding agriculture tradition of the County and the State. The
J'TT'MOINHOS MZAHVA LIVAH NIZISNMOHg 10 Coalition includes organizations integral to the storied Ventura County agricultural industry.

11 The members of the Coalition's organizations represent the current generation of farmers who IILZ-IOTE6 VO 'EJEqIEE Pu2S 100Ld puz ans edeoray IZOI 12 have worked the County's agricultural lands for decades and would like to ensure a future of

13 strong, viable agriculture in the County.

14 2. The Petition challenges the County's adoption of Urgency Ordinance No. 4560 of

15 the County of Ventura Extending for 10 Months and 15 Days Urgency Ordinance No. 4558

16 Prohibiting the Outdoor Planting of Industrial Hemp Within Certain Parts of the Unincorporated

17 Area of Ventura County ("Hemp Ban"), which illegally prohibits the planting of hemp within

18 one-half mile of "(i) any land within a city a zoned for residential use, (ii) any existing residential

19 community in the unincorporated area of Ventura County or (iii) any school," a school being

20 defined as "any licensed day care center, public and private schools, colleges and universities."
s 3. The Hemp Ban imposes undue and unnecessary restrictions on an already
22 severely constrained agriculture industry in the County and sets a disturbing precedent for
23 regulatory oversight of farmers' crop choice and business decisions. These actions threaten the
24 ongoing viability of the agriculture industry within the County, which has served as a

25 cornerstone of the County's economy and community for over 150 years. Undermining the

26 viability of agricultural operations leads to the conversion of agricultural lands into residential

27 development, further stressing remaining nearby agricultural operations and leading to increased

28 agrisulture, water, traffic, air quality, land use, and greenhouse gas impacts.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4. As discussed further below, Ventura County farmers have been cultivating the

2 land within the County for over a century. A few of these farmers began legally growing hemp

3 in 2018. This number increased to over 40 farmers in 2019, who cultivated hemp in the County

4 on over 3,600 acres. Hemp's economic and environmental benefits created this groundswell of

5 support for the crop.

6 5. The crop is estimated to be a top five- or six- value crop in the County, with half

7 the water demand of typical crops. Hemp requires minimal pesticide and herbicide use, and

8 prevents the invasion of noxious weeds. Hemp also is a powerful tool in carbon capture, a soil

9 remediation, and reducing air quality emissions. (See Exhibit A, A Review on the Current State
J'TT'NOAHHOS MNHAVA LIVAH NIISNMOXS 10 of Knowledge of Growing Conditions, Agronomic Soil Health Practices and Utilities of Hemp in

11 the United States (April 2020) MDPI, Agriculture 2020.) These benefits are critical to the
TILZ-101E6 VO EEQIEA BIUES 100L PUZ q39NS BJEOBUY ItOl 12 farmers and communities in the County who deal with high costs for land, a limited water a

13 supply, and pesticide, soil remediation, and air quality issues.

14 6. Hemp farmers in the County spent significant resources developing their

15 businesses in 2018, 2019, and 2020. They made necessary arrangements and signed contracts

16 for the delivery of expensive and scarce industrial hemp seeds and/or plant clones; obtained

17 financing on this new high-risk crop through investors, banks, financial institutions, and venture

18 capital funding; secured off-take agreements between the farmers and their buyers to purchase

19 future crops of industrial hemp; and invested in drying and extraction facilities for harvesting and

20 processing of this agricultural crop. The County's Hemp Ban undermines the vast majority of

21 this work, as it immediately prohibits the cultivation of hemp on 11,019 acres of otherwise

22 suitable rotational, irrigated farmland within the County, including 1,216 of the 3,798 acres that

23 had already been registered for hemp cultivation in 2020. It also discourages investment in hemp

24 cultivation on the remaining irrigable acres in the County as it creates regulatory uncertainty.

25 7. The Hemp Ban will lead to innumerable significant environmental impacts.

26 Farmers will be forced to shift to different crops, making hemp's agriculture, water supply,

27 greenhouse gas, hazards, and air quality benefits unattainable. Further, the increased regulation

28 County's agriculture industry will lead t° the conversion of agricultural land to urban

1

2 development, which, in itself, is a significant environmental impact, but may also lead to further

3 agriculture, water supply, greenhouse gas, hazards, air quality, land use, urban sprawl, growth

4 inducement, energy, and transportation impacts.

8.

5 Unsurprisingly, the Hemp Ban runs afoul of State law and local land use

6 regulations, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

7 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000, et seq.), the State Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, § 65000, et

8 seq.), the Right to Farm Act (Civ. Code, § 3482.5), the County's Right to Farm Ordinance

9
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP (County Mun. Code, §§ 8114-2.1.1, 8183-4.1; see also id. § 9121), and the County's General

10 Plan. Similarly, the County did not support the findings necessary to adopt the Hemp Ban with

11
EILZ-IOI 1021 J00Td puz ans edeoeuy any evidence-namely, that an "urgency" existed justifying the Hemp Ban, that the Hemp Ban

12 addressed a current or immediate threat to the public health, welfare or safety, or that the

EqIeE aueS VO 13 adoption of a one-half mile buffer from residences is based in any evidence, warranted 0r

14 justified. Agricultural operations are businesses that by definition generally create impacts on

15 their neighbors. The County was arbitrary and capricious in singling out hemp cultivation.

9.

16 For these reasons, the Coalition respectfully seeks a writ of mandate and

17 declaratory relief requiring the County to rescind, void, and vacate the Hemp Ban. The Coalition

18 also prays for appropriate injunctive relief to maintain the status quo and allow farmers to plant

19 crops they have invested in and planned to plant this year. Thus, the Coalition seeks to prevent

20 the County from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Hemp Ban during the

21 pendency of this litigation and prior to complying with all applicable laws.

II. PARTIES AND STANDING

22 10.

23 Plaintiff and Petitioner Ventura County Coalition of Labor, Agriculture and

24 Business ("CoLAB") is a California nonprofit mutual benefit corporation with its principal place

25 of business at 1672 Donlon Street, Ventura, California 93003. CoLAB was formed to support

26 land-based businesses like farming and ranching, and to promote sensible and rational local

27 government. CoLAB advocates for businesses in local regulation, providing expertise, research,

28 and educational campaigns to inform CoLAB members and the public. CoLAB employs these
aüosofs to preserve and support a healthy and expanding economic base, promoting a positive

2 protecting the local quality of life. CoLAB's members, which total more than 520, own and

3 operate agricultural businesses throughout the County.

4 11. Plaintiff and Petitioner Ventura County Agricultural Association (*VCAA") is a

5 California nonprofit mutual benefit corporation with its principal place of business at 916 W.

6 Ventura Boulevard, Camarillo, California 93010. VCAA represents the interests of virtually all

7 of the local major farmers, packing houses, and farm labor contractors located in the County.
VCAA's members number more than 200, with farming operations across the entirety of the
County. VCAA routinely appears before the Board to testify and take legal positions on a 8

11 administrative agencies which have engaged in administrative actions contrary to the business
IIET-TO1C6 VO '8IBQZA IO0L puz "O3NS EdROBRY IZOl 12 interests of its members.

13 12. Plaintiff and Petitioner Farm Bureau of Ventura County ("Farm Bureau") is a

14 California nonprofit mutual benefit corporation with its principal place of business at 5156

15 McGrath Street, Suite 102, Ventura, California 93003. The Farm Bureau is dedicated to

16 ensuring that farmers and ranchers in Ventura County survive and thrive. The Farm Bureau

17 advocates for the County's agricultural industry by promoting policies and fostering community

18 action intended to preserve agriculture's sustainability and viability within the County. The

19 Farm Bureau has over 700 members, representing generations of large and small agricultural

20 operations throughout the County, with both conventional and organic farms producing over 100

are referred to herein 21 commodities.

22 13. Plaintiffs and Petitioners CoLAB, VCAA and Farm Bureau

23 collectively as the "Coalition." Generally, the Coalition's members include farmers that have

24 been operating within the County for generations, working their land, cultivating crops, and

25 helping to drive the economy of the County. In recent years, several of these members have

26 farmed industrial hemp, pursuant to lawful permits for the growing, cultivation, and harvesting

27 of industrial hemp. These members are penalized by the Hemp Ban, which unlawfully prohibits

28 ths sintinued operation of their industrial hemp operations.

1 14.

2 As an example, McGrath Family Farm is a member of each of the Coalition

3 organizations and it represents the current iteration of a farming operation that has been
cultivating land in the County since the middle of the 19th

4 century. The Farm includes over 300

5 acres of land three miles west of the City of Camarillo and within one-half mile of residential

6 and commercial land uses. The Farm typically cultivates vegetables like collards, kale, celery,

7 and cabbage. In 2018, McGrath Family Farm planted 29 acres of hemp for research programs

8 and, in 2019, increased the planted area to 58 acres. McGrath Family Farm has never received

9 any complaints related to its hemp cultivation and, on information and belief, the County also

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 has never received any complaints about its operations. Despite that, the Hemp Ban prohibits
McGrath Family Farm from cultivating on 28 acres of the Farm previously planted with hemp.

1021 Anacapa Street. 2nd Floor 11
TTLZ-IOIES VO 'UIBQIBE BQUES 12 If it remains in place, the Hemp Ban will take an unquestionable toll on McGrath Family Farm.

13 The Farm has arranged for a prestigious research institution to study its hemp cultivation in

14 2020. This research endeavor is now prohibited by the Hemp Ban, Similarly, McGrath Family

15 Farm will be prevented from realizing the economic and environmental benefits of hemp, and
will lose the substantial investment it has made to cultivate hemp in 2020.

16 15.

17 Like McGrath Family Farm, Terry Farms, Inc. is a member of each of the

18 Coalition organizations and has been cultivating in the County since the 19th century. Terry

19 Farms, Inc. has typically cultivated fruit and vegetable crops 01 over 2,200 acres in the County,

20 including in the unincorporated areas of Oxnard, Piru, Fillmore, Santa Paula, Ventura, Oxnard,

21 and Camarillo. In 2019, Venterra Farms, Inc. was formed by an owner of Terry Farms, Inc.to

22 cultivate hemp and realize the crop's economic and environmental benefits. Similar to McGrath

23 Family Farm, this hemp cultivation has not generated any complaints from neighboring

24 properties. However, the Hemp Ban has significantly impacted Venterra Farms' operations. The

25 Hemp Ban prohibits Venterra Farms' from planting on two of the properties it planted in 2019
and partially prohibits hemp cultivation on another

26 property. More broadly, the Hemp Ban has

27 hindered Venterra Farms' ability to hold meaningful negotiations with companies that desired to

And Venterra Farms' investment in 2 dwindled with the adoption of the illegal Hemp Ban.

3 equipment, land, leases, labor, time, and effort for its anticipated 2020 hemp season have been

4 lost.

16. In sum, the Coalition's members have been, are being, and will continue to be

6 adversely affected and irreparably injured by the Hemp Ban. The Coalition's organizational

7 missions have been, are being, and will continue to be frustrated by the Hemp Ban, which is

8 damaging agriculture in Ventura County. The Coalition has been, is being, and will continue to

9 be required to divert organizational resources to oppose the Hemp Ban and to ensure the Hemp
dTI'NOAHHOS HHIXY, LIVAH NIAISNMONg 10 Ban is not allowed to proceed.

11 17. The Coalition's members' interests are germane to the Coalition's stated ITLZ-LOTS6 VO 'RIZQIEE BDES 1021 1001ä puz tanS edeseuy 12 purposes and goals, and will be directly affected by the Hemp Ban. The members and the

13 Coalition further have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with all

14 applicable laws, including, but not limited to, CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, the

15 Right to Farm Act, the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, and the County's General Plan.

16 Indeed, the Coalition and their members, agents, employees and families will be directly affected

17 by the lack of environmental review of the Hemp Ban. They will suffer the unanalyzed

18 environmental impacts of the Hemp Ban, such as the impacts to water quality and quantity,

19 agriculture, hazards, land use, air quality, greenhouse gasses, and growth inducement. As

20 members of the general public, moreover, the Coalition's members possess an interest in

21 protecting public resources present in the area, and ensuring compliance with State and local

22 land use law. The Coalition is suing on its behalf, and on behalf of others who will be affected

23 by the Hemp Ban, as well as for all citizens more broadly, including those who seek to maintain

24 the integrity and fairness of the environmental review and land use entitlement process.

25 18. The Hemp Ban will further impact the entirety of the agriculture industry within

26 the County and the State as it sets precedent for discrimination against agriculture practices, the

27 violation of the law, and the undue regulation of farming practices.

4 Hemp Ban.

25. The grounds for noncompliance with all applicable laws alleged herein are

6 consistent with the objections raised by the Coalition prior to the adoption of the Hemp Ban,

7 26. If any grounds for overturning and invalidating the Hemp Ban alleged herein

8 were, for some reason, not raised prior to adoption of the Hemp Ban, it was because there was no

9 meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections prior to the approval
d'TI'XJIMHJS gaaav, JIVAH NIAISNMOXA 10 of the Hemp Ban, or because the County failed to give notice required by law.

13 A. Agriculture Is Vital to the County Economy and Community
14 28. The agricultural industry has been a cornerstone of the County's economy and

15 community for more than a century. The industry provides jobs to the community, feeds

16 residents across the State, and provides important tax dollars to local regulatory agencies. The

17 County is one of the leading agricultural counties in the United States. Its $2.1 billion in annual

18 crop production value ranks eighth in California and in the nation. Ventura County is a major

19 producer of specialty crops such as fruits and vegetables for the fresh produce market. Top

20 commodities include strawberries, raspberries, celery, lemons, tomatoes, peppers, and avocados.

21 Altogether, farming and farm-dependent businesses, such as packinghouses, and pesticide and
fertilizer applicators provide an estimated 43,000 jobs in Ventura County, more than any other 22

23 sector of the local economy except services.

24 29. The Coalition's members represent a majority of this industry--from families that

25 have farmed their property in the County since the 19th century to businesses that provide the

26 essential services and materials necessary for farming to flourish in the County, These families

27 and businesses and their workers are vital members of the County community.

1 30. Despite its productivity, the County has lost a significant amount of agricultural

2 land to development over the past 30 years.

3 31. In response, the Legislature has taken numerous actions to preserve this vital

4 industry across the State, such as the Right to Farm Act. The Right to Farm Act provides:

5 (a)(1) No agricultural activity, operation, or facility, or appurtenances thereof, conducted or maintained for commercial 6 purposes, and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar 7 agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or 8 about the locality, after it has been in operation for more than three
years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began ... it 9
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP (d) This section shall prevail over any contrary provision of any 10 ordinance or regulation of any city, county, city and county, or
11 other political subdivision of the state. However, nothing in this
rOOLH put saans edeoruy 1021 section shall preclude a city, county, city and county, or other T1LZ-IOIE6 VO 'LEQIUE BIUES 12 political subdivision of this state, acting within its constitutional or statutory authority and not in conflict with other provisions of state
13 law, from adopting an ordinance that allows notification to a prospective homeowner that the dwelling is in close proximity to an
14 agricultural activity, operation, facility, or appurtenances thereof and is subject to the provisions of this section consistent with Section 1102.6a. 15

16 (Civ. Code, § 3482.5 [emphasis added].)

32. Consistent with the Right to Farm Act, the County has enacted its own Right to 17
Farm Ordinance (County Ordinance No. 4151). Recognizing the importance of agriculture 18

19 within the County, the County stated its policy as:
to enhance and encourage agricultural operations within the County 20 Where non-agricultural activity uses extend into agricultural areas or exist side by side, agricultural operations frequently become the subjects of nuisance complaints due to lack of
22 information about such operations. As a result, agricultural operators are forced to cease or curtail their operations. Such
23 actions discourage investments in farm improvements to the detriment of adjacent agricultural uses and the economic viability of
24 the County's agricultural industry as a whole. It is the purpose and intent of this Ordinance to reduce the loss to the County of its
25 agricultural resources by clarifying the circumstances in which agricultural operations may be considered a nuisance.
26 33. In light of this policy, the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, among other things,

27 provides:

28 20493910 No agricultural activity, operation or facility that is consistent
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 with this Chapter and the General Plan, and is conducted or maintained for commercial purposes in a manner consistent with
2 proper and accepted customs and standards as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality,
3 shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality, after it has it been in
4 operation for more than one year if it was not a nuisance at the time it began.
5 (County Mun. Code, §§ 8114-2.1.1, 8183-4.1; see also id. § 9121.)
6
34. The County's recognition of the importance of the agricultural community
7 extends beyond its Right to Farm Ordinance. The County's General Plan, its governing
8 document, notes that: "Agriculture plays an important role in the National, State, and County
9 economy. Ventura County is one of the principal agricultural counties in the State, ranking tenth
10 income of 610 million dollars and ranked seventeenth in farm earnings out

LILZ-I0I66 VD 'ZIEQIRE BITES of 3,175 counties nationally." The County's General Plan includes numerous goals, policies and
12 programs to protect this important aspect of the County's economy.
13 35. As an example, the General Plan's goals include to:
14 Preserve and protect agricultural lands as a nonrenewable
15 resource to assure the continued availability of such lands for the production of food, fiber and ornamentals.
16 Encourage the continuation and development of facilities
17 and programs that support agricultural production and enhance the marketing of County grown agricultural
18 products.

19 Improve the economic viability of agriculture through policies that support agriculture as an integral business to 20 the County.

21 Promote the economic viability of agricultural lands by assisting agricultural producers and establishing zoning 22 policies that support long term investments in agriculture.

23 Establish policies and regulations which encourage agricultural land to remain in farming and related uses.
24 Restrict the introduction of conflicting uses into farming
areas. 25

26 (County General Plan, Goals 1.6.1, 3.2.1.)

27 36. And the General Plan's policies include:

28 Discretionary development, located on land designated as

Agricultural (see Land Use Chapter) and identified as Prime Farmland or Farmland of Statewide Importance on the N State's Important Farmland Inventory, shall be planned and designed to remove as little land as possible from potential co t agricultural production and to minimize impacts on topsoil.
Discretionary development adjacent to Agricultural- designated lands shall not conflict with agricultural use of 5 those lands.

6 (County General Plan, Policies 1.6.2.)

7 37. The Final Subsequent Environmental Impact report for Focused General Plan

8 Update, certified by the County in 2005, explains the significance of the Right to Farm

9 Ordinance and the General Plan's goals, policies, and programs on agricultural activity in the
County:

Mitigation of potential impacts is focused on minimizing the 1o0Ta puz "eens edeaery 1ZOI IIVAH NIZISNMONg FARBEI 'XONHOS d'I1 10

11
LILZ-T0IE6 VO EE q7R I BIUES incompatibility between agricultural operations and other land uses. 12 In 1997, the County passed a Right-to-Farm Ordinance to protect commercial agriculture from nuisance claims based on a 13 presumptive right to farm. This ordinance prevents agricultural activities, operations, and facilities that are consistent with the 14 Zoning Ordinance and General Plan from being deemed a "nuisance." It also mandates disclosure to users of property located 15 near agricultural operations of the noise, odor, dust, chemicals, and smoke that may accompany such agricultural operations. 16
In order to mitigate the impacts of sensitive uses from farming and, 17 in turn, the impacts to farming from conflicting uses, General Plan policy 1.6.2-6 prevents discretionary development from conflicting 18 with adjacent agricultural land. The Agricultural Commissioner and the Ventura County Agricultural Advisory Committee (APAC) 19 provide CEQA review and recommendations for new discretionary projects. The intent of this review is to protect agriculture from 20 potential vandalism, trespassing, theft, etc. and to protect neighboring urban uses from pesticide drift and similar impacts. 21 Measures used to mitigate these impacts are evaluated on a case-by- case basis and include setbacks from agricultural uses, vegetative 22 buffers, and easements to compensate growers for modifications to their farming practices. Each of these programs is intended to 23 reduce the loss of agricultural resources within the unincorporated County. 24 (Id. at p. 49.)
25
38. In sum, the State and the County have recognized the agriculture industry as an 26 integral piece to the continued success of the State and County economies and communities. The
27

1 State and the County have previously taken the necessary actions to ensure the continued

2 viability of the agriculture industry.

3 B. Hemp Cultivation Is a Blossoming Sector of the Agriculture Industry

4 39. "Industrial hemp" or "hemp" is defined as "an agricultural product, whether

5 growing or not, that is limited to types of the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant,

6 including the seeds of the plant and all derivatives, extracts, the resin extracted from any part of

7 the plant, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, with a delta-9
8 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis." (Food &

9 Ag. Code, § 8100(a)(6).)

10 40.

11 J00LI put *ans Cdeoruy LIVAH NIEISNMONg JTT'MONNHOS HHQAV; The entirety of a hemp plant is a useable product, from its seeds, stems and roots
to its leaves and flowers. Hemp is most commonly known for its versatility and sustainability, as IIL7-10IS6 VO 'EJEQNA BIUES 12 it can be used to create paper, building material, fabric, plastic composites and beauty products,

13 which typically require more environmentally-imposing materials and processes. However, the

14 mere practice of hemp cultivation also benefits the soil and the environment--it serves as a great

15 cover crop, preventing weeds from inhabiting soil; it captures carbon dioxide from the

16 atmosphere, reducing greenhouse gas emissions; it is cultivated with minimal pesticides and

17 herbicides; and, it requires very little water to grow. (See Exhibit A.) In a state like California,

18 where agriculture rides the drought and deluge weather cycle, hemp's benefits make it a critical

19 opportunity for the industry.

20 41. In addition to all of these economic and environmental benefits, hemp is well

21 suited for the agriculture industry in the County. The County's agriculture industry typically

22 works on a fall to spring cycle, with much of the land lying fallow in the summer. Hemp is

23 typically planted in the spfing, grown in the summer and harvested in a two-to-three week period

24 in the fall, permitting the crop to be grown outside of the normal fall to spring production season

25 for crops such as strawberries and celery. This affords the County's farmers a valuable

26 opportunity-to realize the benefits of hemp, while still cultivating their typical crops during the

27 County's main growing cycle. Further, hemp's low water use will prove a particularly
advantageous trait as Ventura County growers-overwhelmingly dependent on local 28

] groundwater for crop irrigation-face future restrictions on extraction triggered by

2 implementation of the state's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Wat. Code, § 10720, §

3 et seq.), which took effect in 2015 and will be implemented over the next 20 years.

4 42. On January 1, 2019, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (*2018 Farm Bill")
became law and removed "hemp" from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances

6 Act. (21 U.S.C., § 812.) The Bill created a binary regulatory scheme for hemp cultivation, The

7 Bill permits states to be the primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp by

8 submitting a regulatory plan to the Department of Agriculture for review and approval. (7

9 U.S.C., § 1639(p).) The state plan must include testing procedures, disposal measures, and
J'TTADIHHOS HagY 10 enforcement actions, among other things. (Ibid.) In the absence of a state plan and if the
11 production of hemp is not otherwise prohibited by the state, hemp production is regulated by a 1001d puz '1331$ BäeaBuy TILZ-10IE6 VO BIEqIH MUBS 12 plan adopted by the Department of Agriculture. (Ibid.)
13 43. In California, the Food & Agriculture Code allows the growing of hemp so long
BROWNSTEIN HYATI 14 as the grower "register[s] with the commissioner of the county in which the grower intends to
15 engage in industrial hemp cultivation" and the "commissioner determines that the requirements
16 for registration" are met. (Food & Ag. Code, 81003.) The Food & Agriculture Code also
17 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a state hemp plan to the United State Secretary of

18 Agriculture by May 1, 2020 for review and approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. (Food &
19 Ag. Code, § 81015.) On information and belief, California has met its deadline to submit a state

20 plan to the Secretary of Agriculture and the final plan should be approved shortly.
21 44. Prior to January 2020, the County permitted commercial hemp cultivation
22 throughout the County pursuant to State law.

23 45. In 2018, the Coalition and its members, who have cultivated the land in the
24 County for the past century, started considering hemp cultivation given its significant economic,
25 agricultural, and environmental benefits and the anticipated decriminalization of the crop by the
26 2018 Farm Bill. Several farmers, like McGrath Family Farms, began cultivating hemp for
27 research purposes under State law, while others, like Venterra Farms, made the necessary
28 business arrangements for commercial planting in 2019. For example, these farmers signed
VERIFIED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

contracts for the delivery of expensive and scarce industrial hemp seeds and/or plant clones,

2 obtained financing on this new high-risk crop through investors, banks, financial institutions, and

3 venture capital funding, secured off-take agreements between the farmers and their buyers to

4 purchase future crops of industrial hemp, and invested in drying and extraction facilities for
harvesting and processing of this agricultural crop.

6 46. Beginning on or about April 30, 2019, the Agricultural Commissioner's Office

7 received registrations for the propagation, growth, and cultivation of commercial industrial

8 hemp. According to the records of the Agricultural Commissioner, over 42 permits were issued

9 to local industrial hemp farmers for the growth and cultivation of hemp beginning in 2019.

10 These permits represented approximately 3,600 acres of industrial hemp with an estimated

11 potential value of over $100 million. The Agricultural Commissioner's Office expected this 300Tx puz "anS edeoeuy d'TT'XOaXH3S HAaaY LIVAH NIUISNMONg LILZ-IOTE6 VO REQIEA BIUES 12 value to increase year-over-year, and estimated that the crop could be a top five- or six-value

13 crop in the County. (See Exhibit B, CBD oil price likely factor in $100 million payoff predicted

14 for Ventura County hemp crop (Sept. 18, 2019) Ventura County Star.)

15 47. Several of the Coalition's members planted their hemp crop in the spring of

16 2019. On information and belief, the vast majority of hemp cultivation within the County

17 coexisted with neighboring uses, both residential and commercial. However, in the fall of 2019,

18 residents within a few communities in the County--Moorpark, Camarillo, and Ojai-raised

19 concerns about odors emanating from only a few of the hemp farms within the County. These

20 residents claimed that the farms were creating a "public nuisance," but these nuisance claims are

21 preempted and prohibited by the Right to Farm Act, the County's General Plan, and the County's

22 Right to Farm Ordinance.

23 48. The County pursued regulation of the ongoing agricultural operations despite the

24 fact that agricultural operations regularly create odors and other potential nuisances to nearby

25 land uses and contrary to the policies laid out in the Right to Farm Act, the County's Right to

26 Farm Ordinance, and the County's General Plan.

2 49. The County Arbitrarily Adopted the Hemp Ban

3 At its November 19, 2019 public meeting, the Board of Supervisors received a

4 report on hemp cultivation within the County from the County Agricultural Commissioner-the

5 Board appointed "leader in promoting and protecting agriculture in" the County. The

6 Commissioner's report stated that there were 47 registered hemp cultivators in the County with

7 3,600 planted acres as of November 2019. The report stated that hemp is typically a 3-4 month

8 crop, with a late spring planting and an early fall harvest and year round cultivation in green

9
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCARECK, LLP houses. The report also described hemp's benefits-that hemp is a water saving crop, virtually

10 pesticide free, and provides for carbon capture and soil remediation. The report, however,

1021 Anacapa Street. 2nd Floor 11
1L7-10156 VO eBqRg eiues claimed that there are issues and concerns with hemp cultivation, which include confusion with

12 cannabis, odor, compatibility with other crops, pest control, pollen pollution, availability of local

13 processing capacity, and increased agricultural theft. The report specified that there are options

14 for mitigating these issues. After hearing the report, the Board directed staff to prepare further

15 reports as to: (1) whether the County could impose a moratorium on, or otherwise cease, the

16 legal cultivation of hemp within the County; and, (2) measures to mitigate odor produced by
hemp cultivation.

17 50.

18 On December 7, 2019, the Farm Bureau submitted a letter to the Board opposing

19 any moratorium on the planting of industrial hemp within the County. The letter explains that

20 such a moratorium would falsely portray the cultivation of a legal agricultural crop as a threat to

21 public health and safety. The moratorium would conflate an "aesthetic annoyance," such as

22 odor, "with a threat to public safety," and establish dangerous precedent for future "noise, dust

23 or odor" complaints to unduly prohibit customary agricultural activities in direct violation of the

24 Right to Farm Ordinance. The letter further notes the benefits of hemp-namely, that it "uses

25 about half as much water as the vegetable crops it displaces, is grown using no pesticides of

26 herbicides, can be transformed into a wide array of useful products, and is potentially valuable

27 enough to be grown profitably even 011 Ventura County's very expensive farmland." And the

28 letter requests that the Board not decide this issue based on complaints from one community,

20493910 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

especially where "thousands of acres of hemp planted elsewhere [in the County] generated 10

2 complaints."

3 51. At its December 10, 2019 public meeting, County Counsel reported that the

4 County "does not have the authority" to impose a complete moratorium on, or otherwise cease,

5 the legal cultivation of hemp within the County under state law. However, County Counsel

6 erroneously reported that the County "does have the authority, upon making appropriate

7 findings, to temporarily (or permanently) prohibit the cultivation of industrial hemp in all or

8 portions of the unincorporated area of the County." The Agricultural Commissioner also

9 presented options to mitigate odor produced by hemp cultivation, such as implementing setbacks

10

1001Z puz y33nS edeoevy BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP from hotspots (e.g., 600 feet setbacks from cities), and permitting the use of low odor varieties.

11 The Agricultural Commissioner's report noted that the hemp working group did not approve of a TILZ-1OTE6 VD RIEQIES BITES moratorium as it would: "scare off investors, postpone[] seed breeding & propagation . [and, 12

13 create a] slippery slope."

14 52. At its December 10, 2019 public meeting, the Board also conducted a public

15 hearing as to whether to adopt an urgency ordinance temporarily prohibiting the planting of

16 industrial hemp in the unincorporated areas of the County for 45 days.

17 53. After receiving the report and conducting the public hearing, on December 10,

18 2019, the Board directed staff to bring to the Board "at its first meeting in January 2020 a

19 proposed urgency ordinance prohibiting outdoor planting of industrial hemp with a buffer of

20 one-half mile from sensitive receptors in the cities, specifically residential zoning and school

21 classrooms, and around schools and existing communities in the unincorporated area." The

22 Board also directed staff to return to the Board in the same time frame with a proposed ordinance

23 with less restrictive means for regulating hemp cultivation.

24 54. On December 19, 2019, a public meeting was conducted by the Ventura County

25 Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee ("APAC'). The APAC is a Committee of five

26 individuals experienced in agricultural issues and selected by the County Supervisors, and is

27 tasked with reviewing and commenting upon agricultural issues and policies that will be decided

28 bstbe Board. At this public meeting, comments, were made to the APAC members concerning
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 the Board's action at its December 10, 2019 public meeting. After hearing comments from the

3 hemp farmers and members of the public, including those who lived nearby to hemp operations,

4 the APAC rejected the Board's action, including the direction to establish an urgency ordinance

5 with a one-half mile setback from sensitive sites, commenting that such a buffer would not
contain the odor, and proposed alternative measures to mitigate any odor impacts.

6 55.

7 At its January 14, 2020 public meeting, the Board received a report from County

8 Counsel as to the Interim Urgency Ordinance to Temporarily Prohibit the Outdoor Planting of

9 Hemp in Specified Portions of the Unincorporated Area of Ventura County While the County

10 Studies Potential Regulations for the Planting and Cultivation of Hemp (*Initial Hemp Ban").
Among other things, the report recommended the Board: (1) find the Initial Hemp Ban is "(a)

OOTd put eans edeaBuy BROWNSTEIN HYATT J'TT'MOIHHOS HIIäVA ER TEO CA 93101-2711 11

12 exempt from the [CEQA] pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15061(b)(3) (no possibility of

13 significant effect) and 15378 (not a project) and (b) categorically exempt from CEQA Guidelines

14 section 15308 (actions by regulatory agencies to protect the environment);" and, (2) adopt the

15 Initial Hemp Ban, which proposed a ban on the outdoor planting of hemp within one-half mile of

16 certain uses for 45 days. The report further stated that it does not "substantively" address the

17 Board's direction at its December 10, 2019 meeting for staff to prepare a proposed ordinance
establishing less restrictive means for regulating hemp cultivation.

18 56.

19 The Agricultural Commissioner also presented to the Board on January 14, 2020.

20 The Agricultural Commissioner's report stated that the proposed Initial Hemp Ban would apply

21 to 1,216 of the 3,798 acres already registered for cultivation in 2020, reducing the total by 32%,

22 and prevent hemp from being farmed on 11,019 acres of otherwise suitable rotational, irrigated

23 farmland in the County. The presentation also explained that there are alternative mitigation

24 measures that could be imposed in lieu of the unduly restrictive Initial Hemp Ban, And the

25 Agricultural Commissioner reported to the Board that all but one other county in the State had
imposed setbacks of up to 1,000 feet from sensitive uses.

26 57.

27 Numerous comment letters and oral statements were made in opposition to the

28 proposed Initial Hemp Ban. As an example, the APAC submitted a letter noting the Hemp Ban
would unduly restrict agriculture in the Countyothreaten the sustainability of the industry, and
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

erode the County's Right to Farm Ordinance. The letter also commented that the Board did not

2 have any evidence to support the adoption of the Hemp Ban on an urgency basis. The APAC
proposed alternative, less restrictive measures to mitigate any alleged impacts created by hemp

4 cultivation to allow the "industry time to develop their own mitigations and best practices
without the need for an Ordinance with such far-reaching consequences." Alternative mitigation

6 measures were particularly compelling as the vast majority of the odor complaints emanated

7 from a few communities in the County, while the text of the Initial Hemp Ban irrationally

8 blanketed the entirety of the County. In other words, the proposed Initial Hemp Ban would

9 apply to farms regardless of whether they had actually been the subject of an odor complaint

10 from neighboring properties.

58. 3101-2711 100L pOL 8, YRS RAS BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, ELP 11 On January 14, 2020, the Board adopted the Initial Hemp Ban (Ordinance No.

12 4558), ignoring the significant opposition to the ordinance, disregarding the lack of evidence to

13 support a one-half mile setback on hemp cultivation, and violating the Right to Farm Act, the EIRQIBE BUPS 14 County's General Plan, and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance. Specifically, the Board

15 approved all of the recommended actions in the County Counsel's report and directed staff to

16 "return to the Board with recommendations for a permanent ordinance relating to hemp

17 cultivation in February 2020, rather than January 2020, as previously directed." The Initial

18 Hemp Ban, as adopted, provides:
19 For the duration of this ordinance and any extension thereof, the

20 outdoor planting of industrial hemp . . . shall be prohibited in any part of the unincorporated area of Ventura County that is within one-half mile of (i) any land within a city zoned for residential use, 21 (ii) any existing residential community in the unincorporated area

22 of Ventura County or (iii) any school, and no person or entity shall engage in or cause the outdoor planting of any industrial hemp in those parts of the unincorporated area of Ventura County. 23

24 (Ordinance No. 4558 [emphasis added].) During discussion prior to the vote, the Board also

25 directed staff to expand the definition of "any school" to include "any licensed day care center,

26 public and private schools, colleges and universities." This modification undoubtedly increased

27 the acreage subject to the prohibition, although the Agricultural Commissioner has yet to release

28 an updated calculation. The Board purported to adopt the Initial Hemp Ban under Government

20493910 20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2

3 Code sections 25123 and 25131, and Government Code section 65858, claiming an urgency

4 existed to "protect the residents of Ventura County from the detrimental effects of the strong,

5 skunk-like odor produced by the growing of industrial hemp .. " The Initial Hemp Ban further

6 stated that any violation of the Ban "is a public nuisance, and the Agricultural Commissioner
may abate or order the violator to abate it."

59.

7

8 At its February 25, 2020 public meeting, the Board received a report from

9 County Counsel as to the Hemp Ban. Among other things, the report recommended the Board:

LIVAH NIMISNMONg d'TT'XONHHOS HHAHVA 10 (1) find the Hemp Ban "(a) exempt from the [CEQA] pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections

1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor RIBqIE BIUES CA 93101-2711 11 15061(b)(3) (no possibility of significant effect) and 15378 (not a project) and (b) categorically

12 exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 (actions by regulatory agencies

13 to protect the environment);" and, (2) adopt the Hemp Ban, which proposed extending the Initial
Hemp Ban for 10 months and 15 days.

60.

14

15 The stringent opposition to the County's actions continued at the hearing on the

16 Hemp Ban. For example, CoLAB submitted a letter to the Board explaining how its proposed

17 action violated CEQA in many respects, including, but not limited to, the Board's failure to

18 analyze the Hemp Ban's potential significant environmental effects to water, agriculture,

19 hazards, land use planning, air quality, greenhouse gasses, and growth inducement. Further,

20 Coalition members submitted letters again explaining how the Hemp Ban violated the Right to

21 Farm Act and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, as well as the County's General Plan. The

22 letters also expressed how the Board could not make the necessary findings to adopt the Hemp

23 Ban as there was no evidence of an "immediate threat to public health or welfare," no evidence

24 to justify extending the Initial Hemp Ban for over 10 months, and no evidence to support the

"topography

25 one-half mile setback imposed by the Hemp Ban as any odor impacts are the product of complex
meteorological conditions, and

26 a growing population." And the letters

27 explained how there are several mitigation measures less restrictive than the Hemp Ban that

28 could be implemented to mitigate any odor impacts and stressing the economic impact the Hemp
Ban will have on the County's agricultural industry,

20493910 21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 61. At its February 25, 2020 meeting, the Board again ignored the mounting

2 evidence against and legal improprieties of the Hemp Ban, approved all of the recommended

3 actions in the County Counsel's report, and adopted the Hemp Ban (Ordinance No. 4560),

4 extending the Initial Hemp Ban for 10 months and 15 days. The Board's action is an arbitrary

5 blanket, prohibiting hemp cultivation in a vast area of the County, It violates State and local law,

6 it is unsupported by any evidence, and it is completely unnecessary. As an example, the Hemp
Ban provides no rational carve outs for small hemp farms planted for research purposes, or for

8 hemp farms willing to implement other odor mitigation measures.
9 62. Members of the Coalition participated in County's public meetings on November

10 19, 2019, December 10, 2019, January 14, 2020, and February 25, 2020. At each of these

11 meetings, the Coalition and others objected to the proposed actions of the Board and requested 1001H puz yans Bdrozuy LIVAH NIZISNMOMg d'TT'NJAHHOS MAGHVA TILZ-IOIE6 VO BqRg BIURS 12 that because of the fledgling nature of the industrial hemp industry in the County in 2019, the

13 Board should allow the industry to address the specific areas that were causing the odor

14 complained of by the citizens and permit them the opportunity to plant new seed varieties that

15 lack the pungent odor of some strains of industrial hemp and address other related farming

16 issues,

17 63. Upon information and belief, County staff has not substantively responded to the

18 Board's December 10, 2019 direction to develop a proposed ordinance with less restrictive

19 means for regulating hemp cultivation,

20 64. The above actions taken by the County have eliminated 1,216 of the 3,798 acres

21 already registered for cultivation in 2020, reducing the total by 32%, and prevented hemp from

22 being farmed on 11,019 acres of otherwise suitable rotational, irrigated farmland in the County.

23 Furthermore, these actions have served as a deterrent to the industrial hemp industry from

24 engaging in further growth of this legal agricultural crop in 2020 and thereafter.

25 65. The Coalition's members have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the

26 course of ordinary law to redress the County's violations of the law in its adoption of the Hemp

NIJISNMOXS HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (The County Violated CEQA)
CA 93101-2711 I001d pug *3anS edeaooy 1021 12 [Pub. Res. Code, §S 21168, 21168.5]
13 69. The Coalition realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 69,
14 inclusive, of this Petition, as though fully set forth herein.
BJURS 15 70. CEQA Guidelines section 15378 defines a "project" subject to CEQA as "the
16 whole of an action, which has the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the
17 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that

18 is," among other things, "an activity directly undertaken by any public agency including

19 enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances . ..." (See Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21065, 21080.)
20 CEQA includes a "common sense" exemption "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is
21 no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant a effect on the environment."
22 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061(b)(3).) The determination of whether an activity constitutes a
23 project subject to CEQA "is a categorical question respecting whether the activity is of a general
24 kind with which CEQA is concerned, without regard to whether the activity will actually have
25 environmental impact." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41
26 Cal.4th 372, 381.) The California Supreme Court recently summarized this standard:
27 [A] proposed activity is a CEQA project if, by its general nature,
28 the activity is capable of causing a direct or reasonably foresecable
20493910 indirect physical change in the enyironment. This determination is
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l made without considering whether, under the specific circumstances in which the proposed activity will be carried out,
2 these potential effects will actually occur, Consistent with this standard, a "reasonably foreseeable" indirect physical change is one W that the activity is capable, at least in theory, of causing. (Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (d)(3).) Conversely, an indirect effect is 4 not reasonably foreseeable if there is no causal connection between the proposed activity and the suggested environmental change or if the postulated causal mechanism connecting the activity and the effect is so attenuated as to be "speculative." 1o (Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1197.)
7
71. CEQA Guidelines also include exemptions from environmental review for
8 certain categories of projects. Relevant here, the Class 8 categorical exemption applies to
9 "actions taken by regulatory agencies ,.. to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement o1* 10 protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of
11 700Td puz "yaans edeoery d'TI'NOAXHDS MEgavä HYATT IUISNMOXE TILZ-TOIE6 VO BUBQIEg BIUES the environment." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15308.) However, this categorical exemption does not
12 prevent environmental review where "the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same
13
type in the same place over time is significant," or where "there is a reasonable possibility that
14 the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."
15 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2(b), (c).)
16
72. The County's determination that its approval of the Hemp Ban is not subject to
17 CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) and 15378, and is categorically
18 exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308, flies in the face of CEQA's
19 principles. Indeed, CEQA is construed "to afford the fullest possible protection to the
20 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Union of Medical
21
Marijuana Patients, supra, Cal.5th at 1184.) The County's action in adopting the Hemp Ban
22 without environmental review ignores this policy and CEQA's statutory requirements. The
23 County abused its discretion; it did not proceed in the manner required by law, failed to make
24 required findings, and failed to support its determination with any evidence.
25
73. Most significantly, it is clear that the Hemp Ban may result in significant
26 environmental effects. As discussed above, hemp is an environmentally superior crop. It
27 reduces water and pesticide use; it regenerates the soil and reduces the carbon in our atmosphere;

24 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND 20493910

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and it creates a new means for the agriculture industry to meet ever rising economic goals. The

2 Hemp Ban will significantly reduce the agriculture industry's ability to capitalize on these

3 benefits. In other words, the inability to cultivate hemp on over 11,000 acres within the County

4 will necessarily increase water consumption, pesticide use, and the amount of carbon in the

5 atmosphere, while degrading the quality of the soil within the County.

6 74. The Hemp Ban's additional restrictions on the agriculture industry also threaten

7 the industry's ongoing economic viability. With these additional restrictions, it is reasonably

8 foreseeable that additional agriculture land will be converted to residential and commercial uses,

9 promoting urban sprawl. Such conversion can lead to innumerable environmental impacts, from

10 increased greenhouse gas emissions, air quality impacts, transportation impacts, land use
11 inconsistencies contrary to policies discouraging urban sprawl, growth inducement, and LOOE POL & MIS MEORA Y TOS erqrg BueS d'TT'NOIHHOS MAHHVA JLVAH NIAISNMOXA TTLZ-IOIE6 12 inefficient uses of energy.

13 75. Furthermore, the Hemp Ban directly contradicts the General Plan's policies

14 regarding the preservation of agricultural resources discussed above, and renders the Right to

15 Farm Ordinance superfluous as it deems certain agriculture a public nuisance due to its proximity

16 to residential uses, the exact result the Right to Farm Ordinance sought to prevent. These
17 inconsistencies create significant land use impacts.

18 76. The County did not analyze any of these numerous environmental impacts prior

19 to adopting the Hemp Ban. For these reasons, it is impossible for the County to support its

20 a findings that the Hemp Ban is not a project subject to CEQA or is categorically exempt from
21 environmental review. The Hemp Ban will have a significant effect on the environment.
22 Accordingly, the County improperly determined that the Hemp Ban is not subject to CEQA.

23 77. The County's improper determination that the Hemp Ban is not subject to the
24 provisions of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and, as such, the adoption of the

25 Hemp Ban should be set aside.

26 78. The Coalition, its members, and the members of the general public will suffer
27 irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Hemp Ban is allowed to go

25 28

- into effect in the absence of a full and adequate CEQA analysis and absent compliance with all

2 other applicable provisions of CEQA.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 3

4 (The Hemp Ban Violates the Law and Is Unsupported By Any Evidence)
[Code Civ. Proc., $§ 1085, 1094.5] 5

6 79. The Coalition realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 78,

7 inclusive, of this Petition, as though fully set forth herein.

8 80. The County's approval of the Hemp Ban is an abuse of discretion in numerous

9 respects. The County's decision is arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with the law, and

10 not supported by any evidence.

11 81. For example, the County did not support the findings necessary to pass an
urgency TLZ-IOTS6 12 urgency ordinance with any evidence. Government Code section 25123 states that an
3 100Tz puz wang à nacapa IZOI d'TTNOINHOS HYATT FARBET BROWNSTEI 13 ordinance may be passed "for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety." *EIEqRE BIUES 14 Similarly, Government Code section 65858 provides that an urgency ordinance may only be

15 passed if there "s a current and immediate threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, and that

16 the approval of additional subdivisions, use permits, variances, building permits, or any other

17 applicable entitlement for use which is required in order to comply with a zoning ordinance

18 would result in that threat to public health, safety, or welfare." The alleged urgency addressed

19 by the Hemp Ban is the claimed "strong, skunk-like odor produced by flowering hemp."

20 However, when the County passed the Hemp Ban, there was no hemp currently under cultivation

21 in the County and no hemp was planned to be planted until the late spring. Further, the alleged

22 odor impacts would not have been experienced until the hemp was harvested in the fall of 2020.

23 More importantly, the County presented no evidence of any impacts to public health, safety, or

24 welfare associated with most, if not all, of the acreage that will now be banned from hemp
cultivation. Occasional smell from an agricultural operation simply does not rise to the level of
an impact to public health, safety, or welfare required to pass an urgency ordinance. 25

26

27 Accordingly, the County cannot support its finding of a current and immediate threat to the

28 public health in February 2020 with any evidence,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 82. Furthermore, the County cannot support the one-half mile buffer imposed by the
2 Hemp Ban with any evidence. For one, the Hemp Ban applies arbitrarily to hemp farms within

3 the County that have not generated any odor complaints from neighboring property owners.
4 Further, any claimed odor impacts of hemp cultivation on those few communities in the County

5 that submitted complaints are the product of complex interactions between topography,

6 vegetation and other buffers, the weather, and the population. There is no evidence that a one-

7 half mile buffer will prevent such interactions. To the contrary, as identified by the Agricultural

8 Commissioner, smaller buffers have been adopted in other Counties, like Sonoma, San Joaquin,

9 Merced, Stanislaus, and Monterey Counties. And after careful consideration, the Department of
10

11
93101-2711 1001 puz "9nS Anacapa IZOT BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP Toxic Substances Control adopted a time-limited one-quarter mile buffer for certain pesticide
applications a near a schoolsite, a much more serious potential threat (See Code Regs., tit. 3, §

12 6691.)

5 13 83. The County's Hemp Ban also directly contradicts the Right to Farm Act and the EBqrg BuBs 14 County's Right to Farm Ordinance. The policy behind both laws is rooted in the belief that

15 agriculture activities shall not be deemed a nuisance due to proximity to residences. The policy

16 recognizes that at certain times agricultural operations may result in smell or noise of other

17 phenomena that could be a experienced as a nuisance by nearby residents. The express purpose of

18 both laws is to prevent agricultural operators from being forced to curtail or modify their

19 commercial operations due to nuisance concerns of neighboring residences. The Hemp Ban

20 completely ignores these laws and declares hemp cultivation in violation of the Hemp Ban a

21 nuisance, regardless of the manner in which the hemp is cultivated, how long agricultural

22 operations have taken place on the property, and any changed circumstances. This direct

23 violation of the Right to Farm Act and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance renders the Hemp
24 Ban arbitrary and capricious.

25 84. Similarly, the Hemp Ban violates Government Code section 65860 by directly
26 contradicting the County's General Plan. Government Code section 65860 requires the County's
27 zoning ordinances to be "compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and
28 prsgrams" specified in the General Plan. The Hemp Ban ignores this requirement as it is
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 inherently inconsistent with the goals, plans, and programs set forth in the General Plan that

2 pertain to the preservation of the agricultural industry within the County.

3 85. Furthermore, the Hemp Ban is arbitrary and capricious in that it is premature.

4 On information and belief, California submitted its state plan to the Secretary of Agriculture for

on 5 review and approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill on or before May 1, 2020. The state plan

6 will regulate hemp cultivation throughout the entirety of the State. As such, any regulation by

7 the County in the interim period before the Secretary of Agriculture issues a determination
the state plan is premature, as the state plan will govern the County's future hemp regulation.

9 86. The County's adoption of the Hemp Ban without any evidence supporting the

the adoption of the Hemp Ban should be set aside. DORE POL SS YAS EECSRES T1ZZ-LOTE6 VO 'ZJBQNVE BIUBS d'Tl'XJAHHJS XAaaYI LIVAH NIZISNMOXA ordinance and in violation of these laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and, as such,

11

12 87. The Coalition, its members, and the general public have suffered and will suffer

13 irreparable harm if the relief requested is not granted. The Coalition, its members, and the

14 general public have been prejudiced by the County's adoption of the Hemp Ban and, as such, the

Abstract: Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an emerging high-value specialty crop that can be cultivated for
either fiber, seed, or cannabidiol (CBD). The demand for hemp and its products has been consistently on
the rise in the 21st century. The United States of America (USA) has reintroduced hemp and legalized
its production as an agricultural commodity through the 2018 Federal Farm Bill. Although there
is a renewed interest in the adoption of hemp due to the emerging market, its production in the United States (US) remains limited partly because of unclear agronomic guidance and fertilization recommendations. This review article provides information on the current agronomic management practices that are available in the literature and identifies the future research needs for cultivating this
multipurpose crop to address the growing market demands. Hemp production could be beneficial
if managed properly. Hemp fertilizer requirements vary in accordance with the type of hemp
grown (seed, fiber, or CBD), soil, environmental conditions and requires a wide range of macro- and micronutrients. Integrating management practices in hemp cultivation intended to build soil health is
promising since the hemp cropping system is suitable for crop rotation, cover cropping, and livestock integration through animal waste applications. Hemp also has significant environmental benefits since it has the potential to remediate contaminated soils through phytoremediation, convert high amounts of atmospheric CO2 to biomass through bio-sequestration, and hemp biomass for bioenergy production. This review identifies that most of the agronomic research in the past has been limited to hemp fiber and, to some extent, hemp seed but not CBD hemp. With the increase in the global markets for hemp products, more research needs to be conducted to provide agronomic guidelines for sustainable hemp production.
Keywords: Cannabis; hemp CBD; hemp fiber; hemp oilseed; soil health for hemp; agronomic
management practices

1. Introduction

Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) or hemp production has recently been the subject of increasing interest around the world, especially in the United States. Hemp is not only a crop that is among many possible agricultural products that could supplement or replace fiber or paper, but it is also a crop with environmental benefits and a potentially profitable crop that fits into sustainable farming systems [1]. Hemp is one of the world's oldest cultivated plants that was developed from wild Camnabis plants
that originated most probably in Central Asia over 3000 years ago [2]. It is a multipurpose crop that could also be grown for its sced, oil, food, and medicinal properties. Hemp is a dioecious annual wind-pollinated crop with separate male and female plants, and occasionally monoecious. It is also
a short-day and photoperiod sensitive crop. Differences in growth rate and development between male
and female plants are typically evident since the male plants tend to flower and senesce earlier [3].

Marijuana and hemp belong to the same plant species (i.e., Cannabis sativa). However, hemp is
genetically different and also distinguished by its use and chemical makeup. More than 100 different chemical compounds called cannabinoids can be extracted from hemp. Two major cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Hemp contains THC of 0.3% or less, while marijuana can contain up to 20% THC, as its primary psychoactive chemical. Certain varieties of hemp have higher levels of CBD, the non-psychoactive part, has medicinal properties [4]. A high A ratio of CBD to THC would make hemp very relevant as a medical treatment for ailments, but opinions remain mixed about how CBD levels might influence the psychoactive effects of THC [4].
The interest in hemp and its benefits has spurred since significant changes in the legalization of
hemp in the USA [5]. For decades, federal law did not differentiate hemp from other Cannabis plants. Cannabis of any kind was made illegal and hemp was classified as a Schedule I Controlled substance
according to the Controlled Substance Act of 1970. There was no large-scale industrial production in the US, and the US market was mainly dependent on imports both as finished hemp products and as ingredients for use in further processing [4]. The USA was the biggest importer of hemp products [4], obtaining most of its seed and fiber from Canada and China, respectively. In 2014, the United States
Congress granted permission through the Farm Bill to run test programs for growing hemp in a number
of US states. Since then, 41 states have passed legislation that allows hemp cultivation. The 2018 Farm Bill declassified hemp from the list of controlled substances and legalized the production of hemp as an agricultural commodity [5]. According to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp that is allowed to be cultivated should have a THC threshold of 0.3%. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
sternly controls its production and enforces rules governing the conditions under which hemp must be
cultivated. Any hemp crop found to have THC levels beyond 0.3% must be disposed of accordingly
as it is classified as marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act [6]. Currently, over 30 nations
grow hemp as an agricultural crop and sell on the world market. Hemp's global market is predicted to double from the year 2016 to 2020, and at present, the US is the third-largest producer of hemp.
Currently, hemp production is legal in 46 states in the US and it is cultivated for commercial or research purposes in at least 47 countries in the world. In the US, the amount of hemp acreage and licenses has
increased rapidly in the last couple of years.
Due to an increase in demand for non-food crops and other food derivatives in the agricultural
sector, hemp has progressively recovered its importance [7]. Hemp is an unconventional crop with
a broad spectrum of adaptation throughout North America [8]. The diverse range of products that
a hemp plant could produce has drawn the attention of a variety of industries. These include agriculture,
textile, automotive, construction, bio-fuel, oil, cosmetics, pharmaceutical industry, etc. [9]. Due to
this increase in interest in hemp cultivation for multipurpose production, some dual-purpose hemp varieties were also introduced in European countries that yield both fiber and seed [10].
Hemp has the potential to be an environmentally friendly and highly sustainable crop if managed
properly [11]. Hemp replenishes the soil and has been proven to remediate contaminated soils [12-14].
Generally, it is considered as a crop that could be grown without any pesticides [15] for certain
varieties [16]. Hemp has the potential to suppress weeds efficiently and can fit well in a crop
rotation [17]. Additionally, some residues of hemp can be used as botanical insecticides, miticides,
or repellants within programs of pest management in organic farming [18]. These properties also make
it suitable for integration in an organic farming system. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) policy on organic certification of hemp states "For hemp produced in the United States,
only hemp produced in accordance with the US Domestic Hemp Production Program and/or the 2014 Farm Bill may be certified as organic, if produced in accordance with USDA organic regulations" [19]. Hence, the advantages of this crop in agriculture are not exclusively limited to its wide range of products and applications, but also due to its potential to improve soil health that encompasses the
plant, environmental, and human health components. The overall aim of this review is to (1) provide
the current state of knowledge and agronomic management practices involved in growing hemp for
fiber, seed, and CBD, and (2) to identify the research needs to improve sustainable hemp production.

2. Hemp Commercial Utilities and Environmental Benefits
2.1. Multipurpose Hemp Crop and Potential Markets

2.1.1. Hemp Grown for Fiber
Fiber derived from hemp is one of the strongest and durable forms of natural fiber. Hemp grown for fiber is one of the oldest and most widely cultivated varieties of hemp. Back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, other natural fibers and synthetic fibers competed for hemp's uses as a textile fiber [20]. Currently, hemp has been re-discovered as sustainable [21], high yielding industrial fiber crop [22] that can help meet the high global demand for fibers. Harvesting for fiber involves mowing (often by a sickle-bar mower), retting in the field, and baling [23]. Hemp fiber is used for textiles, clothing, as biocomposites for automobiles, paper, building materials (hempcrete), animal bedding, and has potential as a bio-fuel crop too [8]. Hemp consists of two types of fibers namely (1) long outer fibers, referred to as bast and (2) the inner short fibers called hurd [24]. For thousands of years, hemp was grown for its bast fiber, while the hurd was regarded as a waste by-product of bast production. Bast fibers can account for 20-30% of the stalk, and superior quality bast fiber is obtained from hemp fields that are densely planted. Hurd fibers, on the other hand, make up 70-80% of the stalk and typically contain 20-30% lignin [25]. Microbial, chemical, or mechanical
means are used to separate the fibers from non-fiber components, or the more valuable bast from the hurds [23]. However, each type of fiber has its use in the industry. Bast are generally used in the automotive and the paper industry, while hurd is primarily used as a livestock bedding, and other construction applications including fiberboard [26]. Fiber produced by dual-purpose varieties is believed to be of lower quality than that produced by traditional fiber varieties. However, the economic benefits of using the whole plant (i.e., including fiber and seed production) may outweigh this factor. Fiber varieties are typically harvested during flowering but before seed formation to obtain optimal fiber quality [27]. Agronomic management practices and growing conditions such as plant density, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and harvest time are important factors that affect yield and quality of fibers [9,28] and are discussed further in this review.

2.1.2. Hemp Grown for Oilseed or Hemp Oil
For at least 3000 years, hemp seed has been used by both humans and animals directly as a food
ingredient or crushed for oil and livestock feed [29]. Hemp seed oil or hemp oil was also used as
lighting oil, and for making soap, paints, and varnishes. Studies have been reported on the uses of hemp in food, beverages, and medicinal preparations, or it being used as a bird and fish feed [30]. The soft seed meal produced by hulling differs from the press-cake that remains after the seed oil
has been extracted, which also has been referred to as seed meal [26]. Nowadays, hemp seed can be made into flour, just like soy, that contains the right amount of protein for the vegetarian diet. The powder, which is characterized by a nutty flavor, adds a unique culinary and healthy twist to baking. In addition to the nutritional values derived from hemp seed, it has positive health benefits, including reducing cholesterol and high blood pressure [31]. Hemp seed is rich in essential and unsaturated fatty acids, and contains as much protein as soybean. The seeds contain approximately 30% protein which includes eight of the daily essential amino acids recommended for humans, 25% starch, and 30% oil [31]. Hemp seed oil is rich in omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids, and is considered ideal for human health [32,33]. Hemp seed oil contains high quantities of linolenic acid and antioxidants of dietary significance [31]. Oil produced from crushed hemp seed is an ingredient in a large variety of body-care and skin products, e.g., shampoos, soap, cream and hair conditioner, industrial oils, and nutritional supplements. Economic prospects for a hemp oilseed crop in the United States is promising, as the demand for hemp seed products (seed, oil, and press-cake) is steadily increasing [34]. Besides the fact that hemp seed oil has various advantages over other vegetable oils, the present health awareness has made it

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 4 of 15

essential to characterize additional vegetable oil sources, e.g., hemp, to be explored as specialty oils.
Hence, currently, there is a great deal of focus on the possibility of exploiting this new crop for seed
and oil production [35].

2.1.3. Hemp Grown for CBD
Cannabis contains a special class of terpenophenolic compounds-the cannabinoids. CBD, the principal cannabinoid of hemp and a non-psychoactive component extracted from the hemp plant,
is one of these compounds. CBD was first extracted from Cannabis in the late 1930s [36] and has ever
since been found to have the curative potential for disorders like inflammation and anxiety as well
as a potential neuroprotective agent and an antioxidant [36,37]. The other cannabinoid of interest
in Cannabis, which is reported to have psychoactive property, is THC. It is the most abundant of
over 60 different cannabinoids. Marijuana primarily produces THC, while hemp varieties produce CBD. However, legally, any Cannabis plant with a THC content at or below 0.3% is regarded as hemp, and above this limit is marijuana. Over the years, CBD also has been tested to treat arthritis,
cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and pain [38]. The US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) recognizes the potential of CBD in the development of therapies but is committed to improving
the regulatory pathways for lawful marketing intended to ensure consumer health and safety. The CBD has been reported to alleviate the intoxicant effects of THC but it is highly debatable and still being intensely studied [39].
Hemp varieties grown for CBD are different from the seed or fiber producing varieties. Since CBD is mainly concentrated in female flowers, the plants are often started in greenhouses from propagated female clones and are transplanted two to four weeks after establishment. The use of hemp for
generating CBD has not received much consideration as of now, although there is a growing commercial
interest in using hemp plants for this purpose [35]. CBD has been an emerging area of interest in the
United States since hemp was legalized, and most states have started passing laws that will enable
more farmers to produce CBD. Apart from its various health benefits, it is an ideal crop especially for
small scale limited resources farmers who are interested in cultivating hemp for CBD. CBD is believed
to be much more economical than all other hemp by-products, and its sales are estimated to lead all
other hemp-based products by 2022 [40].
Even though there is a knowledge gap in hemp cultivation for CBD, many farmers across the
United States are looking to grow CBD hemp. A study published on a recent survey suggested that there is an interest among farmers to adopt hemp due to the growing market for hemp products
mainly CBD [41]. Specifically, this study involved the participation of total of 245 organic farmers in North Carolina who participated in an online Qualtrics questionnaire to ascertain their knowledge of, and willingness to adopt, hemp cultivation. Findings from this study revealed that a majority of respondents (85%) of North Carolina organic growers are interested in growing hemp on their farms and the majority showed interest in learning more about crop production practices, varieties, and legality associated with growing this crop (Figure 1). Among the respondents, about 52% wanted to grow hemp primarily for medicinal CBD production. More research needs to be conducted to test
CBD hemp varieties under different growing conditions to produce higher CBD concentrations while keeping the THC levels below the legal limit of 0.3%. It is expected that this interest will further
improve once specific agronomic guidelines for growing CBD hemp has been established.

2.2. Environmental Benefits
2.2.1. Phytoremediation
Hemp is recognized as one of the plants that could be used for land reclamation due to its intense
growth specifically for the high yielding fiber varieties [42]. Hemp has been shown to have an intrinsic capacity for phytoremediation, remediating land polluted by heavy metals [43]. The hemp grown
for fiber is tall, and its roots grow deep into the soil about 45-90 cm. This enables the plant root to
penetrate deep and increase the efficiency of removing widespread contamination as compared to other plants with a shallow root system [13]. Hemp has a high potential to absorb and accumulate heavy metals like lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), etc., through its roots and then store them, thus, making it possible to harvest the hemp plant alongside the hazardous compounds. A wide range of hemp varieties are good candidates for phytoremediation and they have a high tolerance to Cd stress [44]. The same study also found that the highest concentrations of heavy metal accumulations
were found in the leaves, although they were distributed in every part of the plant. Leaves of hemp plant collected from contaminated heavy metal site in Pakistan showed an accumulation of heavy metals; Cu (1530 mg kg-1), Cd (151 mg kg-l), and Ni (123 mg kg-1), respectively [45]. Back in 1986, hemp was planted to help decontaminate the soil around the site where the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster
occurred [13].
2.2.2. Carbon Sequestration
Hemp's fast growth and development makes it one of the fastest sources of CO2-to-biomass
converter. Hemp has been proven to be an ideal carbon sink as it can capture more CO2 per hectare than other commercial crops or even forests. For example, one hectare of hemp can absorb 22 tons of CO2 per hectare. High biomass crops like hemp, that are grown for fiber, can sequester higher amounts of carbon by photosynthesis and then store it in the plant's body and roots through bio-sequestration. Most of the carbon is stored in the harvested hemp stem in and less in the roots and leaves. Hemp could produce at least 13 tons of biochar per hectare annually [46]. One of the other potential uses of hemp biomass would be the production of biochar for soil applications that could potentially improve soil
carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions [47,48].

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 6 of 15

2.2.3. Biomass and Biocnergy
Hemp has been recognized as one of the energy plants due to its high biomass and energy concentration per hectare [49]. Weed suppressing abilities, low pesticide requirements, and soil health improvement properties of hemp plants make it even more energy efficient [49,50]. Fuel properties of hemp are either similar or superior to other solid biofuels such as cereal straw, wood, etc. [51]. For example, the heat of combustion of hemp (18.4-19.1 MJ/kg) is comparable to maize Zea mays (18 MJ/kg), slightly greater than Jerusalem artichoke Helianthus tuberosus (16.5 MJ/kg), and slightly less than Miscanthus sp. (19.8 MJ/kg) [50-52]. Additionally, both wet and ensiled hemp biomass can be transformed into biogas and ethanol [49,52]. Hemp also emits comparatively low sulfur compounds [50] and has low ash content [49]. Thus, hemp has the potential to contribute toward
renewable energy.
3. Growing Conditions for Hemp Cultivation

3.1. Soil Conditions
Hemp can be grown on several soil types, but it thrives best on loose, well-drained loam soils that are rich in organic matter [53,54]. The most suitable soil for hemp cultivation should have a pH 6.0-7.5 [28] and according to [55], the optimum soil to pH for hemp production ranges between 5.8 and 6.0 as it does not grow well in acidic soil. The soil should be deep, well-aerated, rich in nutrients, and have good water-holding capacity [53]. Sandy loam texture is ideal for hemp growth, followed by clay loam, but heavy clay soil and sandy soil are not very well suitable because they hold too much or too little water [56]. Soil preparation is an essential process in hemp cultivation, and all soil hard pans should be broken to allow free draining as waterlogging kills the plants, especially the young ones. The presence of a compacted layer can restrain root development, particularly when the compaction pan is due to poor soil preparation. Hemp is a tap-rooted crop, and in fine soils, the taproot typically takes on an L-shape, which negatively affects the uptake of nutrients and water by the crop [15]. A study concluded that fertile clay loam or silt loam soils with neutral alkalinity are most suitable for hemp cultivation [57]. Hemp does not germinate well in acid sandy soils, heavy clay, or gravelly soils. Hemp plants could grow in peaty marshlands but will yield lower amounts and quality of fiber [57]. Hemp is very sensitive to soil moisture conditions and should not be subjected to drought. It grows well in soils in with high water-holding capacity, and good soil drainage is crucial to maximizing its production since most hemp plants failed to grow in poorly drained soils [58].
3.2. Day Length
Hemp is short-day plant hence very sensitive to photoperiod. The day length affects the amount of light received by the hemp plant, and has been reported to strongly influence the productivity in different hemp varieties. The shift from the vegetative to flowering stage in hemp is dependent on day length and variety. However, it has been reported that some varieties initiate flowering regardless of day length, while others require shorter days to transition to flower developmental stage [59]. Data on the specific number of light hours required per day are limited and thus require further exploration.
3.3. Plant Spacing
Plant spacing in hemp is dependent on the type of hemp cultivated, i.e., fiber, seed, or CBD. Generally, hemp planted at high density encourages taller height and restricts flowering. Hemp cultivated mainly for fiber are planted closely together in order to promote stalk elongation with reducing branching, attributes that will ensure longer and stronger fiber yield [60]. It also results in the production of high-quality hemp crop because the high-density stands can suppress weeds, thereby eliminating the need for herbicides. On the contrary, hemp planted for seed and CBD are well spaced out to maximize the desired flowering and branching.

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 7 of 15

Hemp is typically planted using seed drills with row spacing ranging from 7.6 to 17.8 cm,
particularly when it is grown for fiber or seed products. However, seeding rate recommendations
vary widely with optimum seeding depth ranging from 1.9 to 3.2 cm. These recommendations
ensure minimal competition for the space necessary for vegetative growth and root development [60]. Another study reported the distance between hemp cultivated for fiber to range from 20 to 40 cm [55]. Higher plant populations in fiber varieties of hemp ensure faster canopy closure resulting in minimal weed occurrence [61]. In the case of hemp grown for CBD, the highest yield of flowers or buds was obtained at a plant density of 15 plants m-?. It was suggested that the highest hemp oil production from seed yielding varieties would require similar planting density [3]. One of the studies reported row spacing in CBD hemp to be similar to hemp varieties grown for sced [62]. In another study, the optimal density for seed production varied broadly and was found to be between 30 and 75 plants m-2 [63]. The most significant variation was found in hemp cultivated for fiber production, where a study reported that sowing densities ranged from 50 to 750 plants m-2 [64]. A suitable plant spacing to obtain high yields of the stem, seed, and inflorescence altogether was found to be 120 plant m-2,
with an inter-row spacing of 0.5 m [65]. Another study reported the optimal density for the cultivation of CBD hemp to be 10 plants m-2 [66]. Results from these studies indicate that optimum hemp spacing is a function of the type of hemp variety grown and soil environmental conditions. However, it is clear that information regarding recommended spacing for optimal CBD and seed hemp production in
a wide range of soils and climatic conditions is very limited and needs to be addressed.

3.4. Temperature
Temperature plays a distinct and essential role in hemp production throughout different growth stages. Hemp grows under a wide range of environmental conditions, and a lot of studies have reported that it is more adapted to the temperate climatic zone. Although hemp grows best when the mean daily air temperatures are between 16 and 27 °C, it can also tolerate colder and warmer conditions.
For example, at low temperatures of 8-10 °C, the seed takes 8-10 days to germinate. Young seedlings with 8-10 leaves can tolerate some exposure to frost typically up to -5 °C. The plant height attained in the field in 90 days can be achieved in 40 days by plants grown at 19 °C in a controlled condition
by regulating the growing degree days (GDD). Hemp grown in the Mediterranean requires about 1900-2000 °C GDD for fiber production and about 2700 to 3000 °C GDD for seed production [27]. However, ideal GDD requirements for high yielding CBD hemp need more investigation.
3.5. Rainfall
Hemp requires high moisture throughout its growing season, but most notably during the first
six weeks of growth when the young plants are getting established [57]. After they are well rooted,
plants can endure drier conditions, but severe drought can negatively hasten up maturity and cause the production of stunted plants. Ideally, hemp requires a rainfall of 63 to 75 cm per annum. Crop water requirement and uptake varies depending on the type of hemp variety, soil, climatic conditions, and management practices. Hemp roots are capable of penetrating the soil up to 2-3 m to extract moisture, provided the soil is not waterlogged and pans do not impede the plant roots. A study conducted in
Europe reported that hemp yield strongly depended on the amount of rainfall between June and July, which was found to be as high as 700 mm [60]. Other studies indicate that hemp requires 25-35 cm of moisture during the vegetative stage and 50-70 cm of available moisture for optimum yield.
4. Hemp Fertility Requirements
4.1. Effect of Nitrogen
Nitrogen (N) plays a significant role in crop nutrition and yield, hence, is considered the most crucial nutrient in hemp production. This fact is well depicted by studies that have reported the responses of hemp to N fertilization. Application of N fertilizers positively affect hemp plant height,

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 8 of 15

biomass for fiber hemp varieties, and grain and protein content for seed yielding varieties. The N
requirement is high during the first one month of hemp growth so N is usually applied at sowing in
most field experiments. A study reported that 79% of total N uptake occurred within the first month with daily N uptake of 3-4 kg ha-1 [66]. Another study reported that N application after sowing or applied by split method did not increase stem yield when compared to N distribution at sowing [67]. An increase in 60 kg dry matter (stem biomass) kg N applied was noticed as N fertilization was increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha-1. However, beyond N fertilization rates of 150 kg ha-1, no further yield increase was reported [67]. Excess N application stimulates rapid stem elongation which makes the hemp crop more susceptible to lodging [15]. Inadequate N, on the other hand, will cause loss of yield, while excess will reduce the fiber quality. Various experimental results have confirmed that N fertilizer application should be determined based on initial soil fertility. A study conducted by [16] also concluded that hemp growth response to fertilizer N was negligible in soils rich in N. Due to differences in environmental conditions and methodologies, the stem biomass per unit of N fertilization cannot
be accurately determined from literature data and therefore warrants more investigation. A recently conducted study reported that N deficiency symptoms were observed in greenhouse-grown hemp for CBD when the N content in the leaf tissue analysis was 1.62% [68]. However, more research is needed to evaluate the effect of N application on the yield of seed and CBD hemp varieties under
field conditions.

4.2. Effect of Phosphorus
Phosphorous (P) is an essential macronutrient required throughout hemp growth stages. However, its demand gradually increases as the plant matures. P is also essential during the early growth stages of hemp as it plays a major role in imparting strength and resistance against
pests. Limited research has been conducted on the effect of P on hemp production. Even though P application increases plant height, it was concluded that its effects on hemp biomass and seed yields were inconsistent and minimal, therefore very negligible [69]. Previous research also showed that hemp response to P might vary depending on growing conditions [70], and its availability plays an important role in the elasticity and tensile strength of hemp fibers. A study reported that P uptake by hemp ranged
from 52 to 67 kg ha* and P fertilization had no effect on stem yield [67]. P enhancement treatment
caused a 16% reduction of THC concentration but did not affect CBD concentration in the flowers [71]. P deficiency can also affect hemp ability to uptake other essential nutrients, and can subsequently reduce the plant health, immunity to disease, crop quality, and yield. Hemp plants suffering from P deficiency show visual symptoms including stunted growth and development of reddish-purple color in the leaf due to anthocyanin pigment formation [72]. In a recent study, leaf tissue analysis of P was reported to be 0.09% for P deficient CBD hemp plants grown under greenhouse conditions [68].
4.3. Efect of Potassium
Hemp is less responsive to potassium (K) compared to N and P fertilization, and very few experiments evaluating the effect of K on hemp have been conducted. One of the studies reported that K did not significantly affect hemp biomass and seed yield [68]. K is a macronutrient and is required in substantial quantities by hemp. K uptake increases as the crop grows which is similar to trends
observed for P [73]. However, in the case of fiber hemp varieties, the peak uptake occurs during fiber developmental stages. K has been reported to have a more significant effect on fiber quality than P [27]. K fertilizer trials suggested that hemp should receive 175 kg Kha™ [74]. A recent study conducted
on CBD hemp under greenhouse conditions reported the K content in leaf tissue to be 0.41% for K
deficient hemp plants [68]. However, the effect of K fertilization on the seed and CBD yields in hemp varicties in the field have not been reported to our knowledge.

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 9 of 15

of 4.4. Effect of Other Nutrients
Hemp plants need a relatively substantial amount of magnesium (Mg) and are very sensitive to Mg
deficiency. Mg-deficient hemp plants are characterized by dark green younger leaves, grayish-white patches in older leaves due to loss of chlorophyll, and slowed root and shoot development. The need for micronutrients for hemp is highly dependent on soil nutrient conditions, organic matter content,
and soil texture. Copper (Cu) deficiency is commonly experienced in peat soils and its deficiency in hemp could lead to breaking of stems. Manganese (Mn) and boron (B) deficiencies have also been reported in hemp [75]. A study conducted in Russia on peat-humus soils have shown that the yield and quality of fiber and seed hemp fertilized with sufficient P and K could be increased by supplemental application of 1 kg of B (as boric acid (I3BO3)), kg of Cu (as copper sulfate (CuSO4), and 10 kg of Mn (as manganese sulfate (MnSO4)) ha l [76]. Leaf tissue analysis of CBD hemp during deficiency symptomology for a wide range of nutrients including Mg, Sulfur (S), B, Cu, Mn, molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn) were reported in a study conducted by [68]. This study also suggested that with the exception of N, K, B, and Cu, other nutrient deficiencies did not significantly decrease the CBD hemp yield. More research at field scale is necessary to evaluate the effect of micronutrients on the
cannabinoids in CBD and seed yielding hemp varieties.
5. Hemp Agronomic Management Practices Intended to Improve Soil Health
5.1. Crop Rotation
Crop rotations are essential to disrupt pest cycles, maintain and enhance soil health, and crop diversification. Crop rotations also increase soil organic carbon and soil organic matter content [77]. Hemp grown for fiber can produce 25 t ha- aboveground biomass and large quantities of root biomass that can be distributed deeper in the soil as compared to corn or wheat [16]. Over two-thirds of organic matter is replenished to the soil when fiber hemp is field retted, and improves soil porosity and friability [78]. Fiber hemp plant is also deep-rooted and has been found to influence the soil structure. Its taproot penetrates deep into the ground aerating the soil at the same time building soil aggregates
and preventing erosion [79]. A group of researchers evaluated hemp grown in monoculture and in rotation with wheat [80]. They concluded that hemp could be grown for several years in conventional monoculture without yield declines. Hemp increased wheat yields in two of three growing seasons
and the researchers concluded that hemp had great potential as a predecessor for wheat under rainfed
Mediterranean conditions. Another study reported a 10%-20% increase in the yield of wheat followed
by the cultivation of hemp [55]. More recent research where soybean was grown as monoculture demonstrated that hemp cultivated earlier had a positive effect on soybean growth [81]. Some reports have also suggested that growing hemp following alfalfa can improve hemp yield.
Hemp plant has been reported to decrease the population of nematodes and pathogenic fungi in the soil, and it has been stated that hemp has the potential to be grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides [82]. Three soil pathogens (the fungus Verticillium dahlia, root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne chitwoodi, and Meloidogyne hapla) were suppressed by hemp, and it was concluded that introducing hemp in a crop rotation might enhance soil health [83]. Hemp's high planting density, rapid soil surface coverage ability and fast growth (especially the fiber yielding) varieties after emergence render it very competitive against weeds [61]. This makes it potentially one of the greatest agronomic and environmental benefits of cultivating hemp in rotation with other crops. An experimental study also demonstrated hemp was able to suppress weed effectively without the use of herbicide, except for places where plant densities were relatively low, between 10 and 30 plants per m? [82]. In order to introduce hemp successfully into crop rotation, information on the optimal sequencing of hemp with other crops, the effect of integrating hemp into rotations on pests, and potential effects of hemp on soil health is necessary and needs to be further investigated across diverse growing conditions in the US.

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 10 of 15

5.2. Organic Amendments
For generations, animal manures and composts have been identified as soil builders because of their enormous impact on improving soil health [84,85]. The nutrient content of animal waste varies depending on different factors like feed source and type, animal age, handling and storing techniques, temperature, and moisture content. Organic amendments are rich with nutrients that are essential for plant's nutritional requirement, like N, which is one of the crucial nutrients required for hemp cultivation. They also add carbon to the soil and improve soil biodiversity. Organic amendments also help reduce nutrient run-offs and leaching of nitrates in the soil. Although various environmental benefits can be derived from manure application, these benefits are optimized when it is applied at an appropriate time and at appropriate amounts and techniques. Improper manure management might contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions [86]. Organic amendments come in various kinds, and can be used depending on location and availability. The commonly used types of manures in hemp production are horse, cow, and chicken manure. It has been reported that hemp is naturally adapted to using mammalian manure, e.g., horse manure as fertilizer, and it can also efficiently employ stocks of livestock manure [78]. Composting of manure is a process that is recommended because it enhances the quality of manure and has been reported to improve soil health properties [85]. Chicken, horse,
and cow manure are recommended to undergo composting before usage to decrease the likelihood of pathogens. It has been reported to contain about 1-2% N and 1-3% K but amounts might vary depending on the type of animal waste used. Although there is a huge potential to incorporate animal wastes for hemp production not much has been reported. Another source of organic amendment would be the application of mulches in hemp cultivation. Organic mulches, i.e., chopped leaves, straw, grass clippings, compost, wood chips, shredded bark, sawdust, pine needles, etc., application have multiple benefits. Mulches are intended to moderate soil temperature fluctuations, improve soil structure by facilitating water and oxygen entry, provide conducive habitats for beneficial soil organisms, e.g., earthworms, reduce soil-borne pathogens, minimize surface runoff, prevent erosion, and reduce weed seed emergence. In cases where hemp is grown for fiber, most of the leaves are returned to the field hence serving as mulch and thereby preserving soil moisture and increasing microbial biodiversity in the soil [78]. Furthermore, when retting of hemp is done on the field, the stems are left behind, which also serves as soil mulch. Many of the residual nutrients from the stalks are then returned to the soil, making them available for the next year's crop. Most of the studies reported on CBD hemp uses black or white plastic mulches, and not much is reported on the use of organic or biodegradable mulches.
5.3. Cover Crops in Hemp Rotation or Using Hemp as a Cover Crop
A cover crop is a crop that is planted mainly to the ecological benefit of soil rather than crop yield [87]. Cover crops are typically grass or legumes and mostly grown in winter before the summer cash crop. Incorporating leguminous cover crops that have biological N fixing capacity also has the potential to provide supplemental N requirements for the main crop in the cropping system. Cover crops also provide ecological benefits to the soil by suppressing weeds and pest pathogens, control soil erosion, help build and improve soil fertility, and increase biodiversity [85,88]. Hemp is an annual crop that could make it a good fit into crop rotation, although very few studies have been conducted on the rotation effects of hemp. In addition, since certain varieties are very photosensitive, there are challenges associated with using hemp as a cover crop. It has been reported that fiber hemp in crop rotation as a cover crop can suppress weed efficiently for the following crop [16] thereby, enhancing soil health by reducing the need for synthetic herbicides. A report suggested that using annual N-fixing cover crops, i.e., sweet clover, fababeans, peas, etc., could supplement the N requirement of hemp later in the season [59]. Some studies also showed that incorporating hemp in a crop rotation has allelopathic effects, thereby reducing pest nematodes. Therefore, hemp can serve as a nematicide
for certain crops, e.g., potatoes, maize, peas, etc., that are susceptible to nematode infestation [89].
Certain hemp residues are also well suited for use as botanical insecticides [18].

6. Conclusions

Hemp production in the USA has been on the rise since the 21st century and more US states have attempted to establish a hemp production system following deregulation according to the 2018 US Farm
Bill. This has significantly increased the potential for hemp markets in America. Many products can be
derived from hemp, but the most enterprising situation for hemp in the USA is oilseed production and
CBD extraction from hemp flowers for pharmaceutical uses. This review indicates that although there is
a renewed interest in the adoption of hemp, its production in the USA remains limited partly because of
unclear agronomic guidance and fertilization recommendations, especially for CBD hemp in different
soil and environmental conditions. Hence, it is essential to explore and update the scientific knowledge of hemp in order to understand and recommend the best management practices. Hemp cultivation requires intensive management, and environmental conditions like seedbed preparation, soil type, day length, seeding rates, dates, harvest dates, etc., are all impacted by the type of hemp variety
employed. Hemp varieties grown for fiber, oil seed, and CBD have different fertilizer requirements and
most of the fertility trials in the past have been limited to hemp for fiber. This review also describes
the potential of integrating agronomic management practices intended to improve soil health like
crop rotation, cover cropping, mulching, and manure application to hemp cultivation. Hemp is
a potential emerging multipurpose crop with not only economic but also soil health benefits through
phytoremediation, bio-sequestration, and bioenergy production. More research on optimal agronomic production techniques needs to be conducted for increased productivity and sustainability in order to
achieve the full potential of this high promising multi-purpose crop.

CBD oil price likely factor in $100 million payoff predicted
for Ventura County hemp crop

Hemp, which has recently been legalized for commercial production, is expected to be a big
factor in Ventura County's agricultural industry. Ventura County Star
Ventura County could become one of the largest hemp-growing areas in California now that
commercial production has been legalized and the first season's crop is being
harvested, officials say.

Agricultural Commissioner Edmund Williams says the county could rank second or third
among the 58 counties at a time when 40% of them have imposed moratoriums on hemp
production.

"It's going to be a really good boost for agriculture in Ventura County," Williams said.
He sees no need for a ban here as farmers and investors try to cash in on the demand
for health-related cannabidiol or CBD oil products made from hemp bred for industrial use.
Although industrial hemp belongs to the same plant species as marijuana, it must by it
definition have negligible intoxicant properties.

The commissioner expects most of the hemp will be sold for CBD, a compound in over-the- counter lotions, salves, salts and oils used to relieve arthritis, anxiety, insomnia and pain.
CBD is contained in edible products, too, but such use is prohibited by federal and state
authorities.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved CBD for any type of pharmaceutical use except two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. Still, customers say it
works.

CBD oil can fetch prices of $30 to $300 for 1 ounce, a likely factor in estimates showing
industrial hemp could produce $60,000 an acre before overhead. Strawberries bring an
estimated value of $70,000 or even $75,000 an acre, but the overhead costs are much
higher than for hemp, Williams said.

$100 million expected
Williams expects hemp to be a lucrative. If no one loses a crop in the 4,100 registered acres in Ventura County, the gross estimated value would reach at least $100 million this year and
likely much more than that, he said.
He said hemp could be ranked among the top five or six top-value crops in the county, running near traditional top sellers such as avocados and raspberries in the first year of
commercial production.
Fields filled with the spiky green plants are nearing harvest now in western Ventura County, One stand of more than 100,000 hemp plants lies along the south side of Highway 101 in Camarillo on land owned by organic grower Phil McGrath. The smell is mild but is expected to grow more pungent when the plants blossom, an issue that regulators and growers say
normally lasts just a few weeks.
McGrath has teamed up with the Ventura Seed Co., which is growing more than 1,000 acres of hemp in Ventura County and New York. The business was started by Riki Trowe and
Akasha Ellis, two men who say CBD helped family members facing major illness and injury.
Trowe says regular, high doses of CBD along with other medical treatments helped his paralyzed son get out of his wheelchair and walk again after diving accident. Ellis said his 76-year-old father has survived stage 4 throat cancer for five years with help of CBD.
"He couldn't eat much but he survived," Ellis said.
The two men came to Ventura County last year because of the potential of growing hemp year round, said Vanessa Ramirez, Ventura Seed's vice president of operations.
McGrath said the new crop can be harvested by machine and requires little water - a plus for farmers grappling with labor shortages and limited water supplies. Another advantage is that hemp is grown in the summer, supplementing the normal fall to spring production
season for crops such as strawberries and celery, he said.
"I think the crop has a ton of great potential economically and environmentally," he said.

Voters weigh in
Hemp was once heavily grown as an agricultural crop in the U.S., but production
dropped and then ended in the late 1950s because of legislation, anti-drug sentiment and
competition from synthetic fibers, according to a 2014 report from the Congressional
Research Service.

7/11

The situation started turning around in the middle part of this decade, partly because California voters allowed hemp to be grown as a commercial crop when they passed a 2016
proposition legalizing personal use and cultivation of marijuana.
Then late last year Congress legalized hemp and allowed the plant to be transported across
state lines. Williams said he understands that at least two states, Kansas and Idaho, are
awaiting regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture before they comply, but that is
not the case in California.

Now, businesses are filing registration documents so they can breed seeds and grow hemp
in Ventura County and other areas of the state. Previously, it had only been allowed to be grown for research purposes, Williams said.
County registration records for hemp properties show much of the investment is coming
from outside the county.
"Many of the registrations are (from) people we have never heard of before," said Andy Calderwood, the deputy agricultural commissioner in charge of the county's hemp program. "They are various partnerships and consortiums of investors. We don't really know beyond the name given to us who is behind all these registrations."
Close to 40 registration applications or permits - have been approved for breeding seeds or more commonly growing hemp. Proposed locations include the Ojai and Santa Rosa valleys, the Oxnard Plain, Moorpark, Camarillo, Somis, Ventura, Santa Paula and
Fillmore.

It's not clear where the hemp will be processed. There's talk of opening processing plants in Oxnard, Thousand Oaks and the unincorporated area of Ventura County, but Williams knew
of no plants operating in the county now.
The biggest player in the county's hemp production appears to be HCG Partners of Las Vegas, which accounts for half of the 4,100 acres registered for hemp cultivation and seed breeding. HCG has linked up with several major growers in the county, some of them well
known.

"It's a who's who of the Oxnard Plain," Calderwood said.

HCG Director Saul Milrod said the partnership came to the county because the area has the
best climate for growing hemp.
The organization pays fees to the growers for planting and tending the crop on their land, but does the harvesting and takes the risk, he said. HCG, which has an office in Somis, is basically made up of two principals, including himself, and two investors, he said.

Milrod, a former commercial airlines pilot who lives in Beverly Hills, said he hopes for good
results from the investment. But it's hard to know yet because it's just the first season, he
said.

Other operations are on the small side.

Fillmore resident Cindy Jackson says she jumped at the opportunity to grow hemp for Ocean Gold CBD, her business that manufactures lotions, salves and oils.

She has been buying CBD oil from area suppliers to make the products, but is starting to
germinate seeds and cultivate hemp on her 4-acre farm in Fillmore.

" wanted to have more quality control," said the 54-year-old mortgage loan officer.

Bumpy rollout seen
Critics, though, say regulations should have been put in place to protect neighborhoods,
churches and schools before the hemp was planted.
"It has not been rolled out in a very careful way," said Ojai resident Pat Hartmann. "It's kind
of haphazard with no restrictions."

She says hemp should not be planted near citrus, which requires spraying of pesticides that
are off limits for hemp. She also objects to the smell, saying the odor resembles skunk.
In late August, the Ojai City Council prohibited growing of industrial hemp within the city.
But cultivation is allowed in the nearby unincorporated areas under the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors' control.

Ojai Mayor Johnny Johnston has asked the board and the agricultural commissioner to stop
registrations of industrial hemp-growing properties until regulations can be put in place. Included could be setbacks from schools, parks and residences and regulation of strains to
ensure the odor is minimized, he said.

Williams said he is enforcing state rules regarding testing of the plants, the varieties that can
be grown and registration of acreage, but has not instituted any county restrictions.
"We want to see how it all it plays out," Williams said.
He did not know of complaints from any city besides Ojai, but said that officials in Fillmore
and Piru are asking questions about the new crop.

9/11

County Supervisor Steve Bennett, who represents the Ojai area, said he was not prepared to propose an emergency moratorium to the rest of the board at this time. The permits to
grow hemp last for only a year, he said.

"I need more information about this before I would feel comfortable trying to sell
four supervisors on an emergency moratorium, particularly when the impacts are
temporary and we can reverse them after one year," he said.

Dig Deeper

Ventura County weed & hemp
In Camarillo, the hemp growing on Phil McGrath's land should be ready for harvest by the middle to end of October, ranch
manager Dave DiNapoli said.
DiNapoli said the plants will be picked, then dried and taken to a processing facility where the CBD compound will be
extracted.

More than 25,000 products can be made from industrial hemp, said Oli Bachie, a UC Cooperative Extension farm adviser in Imperial County who is studying hemp production. The plant can be used for fiber, feed, textiles and oils, but most if not all of the strains of hemp being planted in the county are for CBD, apparently because of the large profits
that are expected.
Bachie would not be surprised to see that happen around the state.
"There is a huge interest in this because people want to grab the first economic benefit out
of it," Bachie said.
Motorists driving around the county may have spotted the new crop if the fields were near roads. Signs warn there is "No THC" to keep out any trespassers confusing the hemp with
marijuana.

The plants look the same, but industrial hemp cannot have any appreciable level of THC, the primary intoxicant in marijuana and hashish. The THC level must be tested at less than three-tenths of a percent for the crop to be harvested. Otherwise, it must be destroyed,
Williams said.

Looking ahead, it's hard to know how lucrative hemp will be and when the market could be
saturated, officials said.
"Until that product hits the market, no one knows what it is going to be worth," said John
Krist, CEO of the Farm Bureau of Ventura County.
