INTRODUCTION

2

1. This action challenges the City of Los Angeles' ("City's") failure to comply with
the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), State Planning and Zoning Law and the
City's Municipal Code in approving a 102-unit student housing development along the historic
West Adams Boulevard.

2. The project includes at least 99 five-bedroom dormitory-style units, resulting in a
8 development with up to 1,000 residents (the "Project" or the "Champion Project"). The Project
would also include only a handful of affordable units and two workforce units, despite claiming
10 to be designed to provide housing to faculty and staff at the nearby University of Southern
11 California. Only 259 parking spaces are included to support all of these tenants.
12 3. In addition to being located along West Adams Boulevard, a City-designated
13 scenic highway, which includes a large collection of historic resources, the Project site is also
14| surrounded by historic resources. This includes both resources that are individually historic,
15 such as the adjacent Kerckhoff House and Waters-Shaw Family Residence, and several National
16 Register Historic Districts and Historic Preservation Overlay Zones ("HPOZ"), including the
17 University Park HPOZ, the St. James and Chester Place National Register Historic Districts, the
18 North University Park Specific Plan area, which functions as a HPOZ, and the Fraternity and
19 Sorority Row historic district.
20 4. Despite the wealth of historic resources surrounding the Project site, which require
21 special consideration of the design and character of development under the applicable
22 Community Plan and Redevelopment Plan, the Project's design is wholly inconsistent with the
23 | historic neighborhood due to its bulk, lack of pedestrian-friendly design that chooses to face
24 away from West Adams Boulevard, and its use of podium parking, instead of underground
25 parking, which is commonly required in this area.
26 5. The Project not only impacts the setting of the surrounding historic resources and
27 aesthetic character of the area, its inclusion of up to 1,000 student tenants would also adversely
28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 impact the adjacent family-oriented residential neighborhood. The lack of adequate parking
2 means Project residents will be required to drive around the neighborhood to find scarce street
3 parking, resulting in traffic and pedestrian safety impacts. The Project also includes rooftop

4 party decks, the use of which by college students could adversely impact the existing residential
5 neighborhood.

6 6. The City's approval of this Project violates CEQA because it relied upon an
7 inapplicable Class 32 categorical exemption. Moreover, even if this class of exemption were
8 applicable, the City could not rely on it for the Project due to the Project's potential impacts to
9 historic resources, the cumulative impacts of this type of student housing development in the
10 University Park neighborhood and the unusual circumstances of this Project's failure to comply
11 with the Redevelopment Plan, Community Plan and Municipal Code requirements.

12 7. The City wholly failed to consider the Project's consistency with the
13 Redevelopment Plan prior to Project approval, instead conditioning the approval upon a later
14 consideration of Redevelopment Plan consistency. This fails to address the fact that the
15 Redevelopment Plan sets a base density for the Project site of 67 dwelling units, but the Project
16 approval relied upon a much higher base density of 83 dwelling units. The findings required
17| under the Redevelopment Plan to exceed the base density have not and cannot be made.

18 8. Further, the City's deferral of analysis and mitigation of impacts for the
19 discretionary approval required by the Redevelopment Plan is in violation of CEQA. Not only
20 is it improper deferral, but it is also improper segmentation of the Project. This improper
21 segmentation also violates the City's Municipal Code, which requires all project applications for
22 discretionary approvals be submitted and processed concurrently.
23 9. The wholesale violations of CEQA by the City have necessitated the filing of this
24 action to obtain a writ a of mandate setting aside approval of the Project until proper
25| environmental review has been prepared and other appropriate relief. Accordingly, Petitioners
26 request that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate to prevent the City or Real Parties in
27 Interest from taking actions based on the faulty Project approval and to require the preparation
28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of environmental review for the Project.
2

3 JURISDICTION

4 10. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 and 1094.5 of
5| the Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources
6 Code.

7 PARTIES

8 11. Petitioner West Adams Heritage Association ("WAHA") is a non-profit,
9 community-based organization comprised of over three hundred households in the West
10 Adams/University Park area, as well as others who support preservation of this community's
11 important architectural and cultural heritage. The specific purpose of WAHA is to support
12 preservation of the West Adams/University Park community's architectural heritage and
13 beautification activities and to educate Los Angeles' citizens and others about cultural history
14 and restoration techniques. WAHA routinely comments on land use applications and
15 environmental documents on behalf of its members in furtherance of these goals.
16 12. Petitioner Adams Severance Coalition ("ASC") is an unincorporated association
17 of individuals, institutions and groups who have a demonstrated interest and mutual concern
18 regarding the Project's impacts on the historic West Adams/University Park neighborhood and
19 who have come together to insure that new development is conforms to the character defining
20 features of the historic neighborhood and does no environmental harm. Members of the ASC
21 include staff of the University of Southern California, the 24th Street Theater, City Living
22 Realty, the North University Park Community Association, and numerous others who
23 participated in the administrative process. ASC is alarmed at the severe and irreparable harm the
24 806 West Adams Boulevard development would bring to the University Park neighborhood and
25 its irreversible impacts to the quality of life.
26 13. Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City") is a political subdivision of the State of
27 California and the lead agency for environmental review of the Project.

10

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS
12 The Project Site.

13 18. The 2.75-acre Project site is an irregularly-shaped lot located on the south side of
14 the historic West Adams Boulevard. Severance Street forms the eastern border of the site. The
15 addresses for the Project site are 758 to 832 West Adams Boulevard and 2610 South Severance
16 Street.

17 19. The Project site is currently occupied by a two-story building used by the
18 University of Southern California ("USC") as an office, childcare, and classroom facility, as
19 well as a surface parking lot and ornamental trees and landscaping.
20 20. The Project site has General Plan land use designation of Low Medium II
21 Residential and is zoned RD1.5-1-0. The South Los Angeles Community Plan contains the
22 General Plan land use policies applicable to the site. The Project site is also located within the
23 Hoover/Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Project Area and subject to its
24 Redevelopment Plan. Further, due to the Project's proximity to USC, located less than a mile
25 from the campus, the City's Neighborhood Stabilization Ordinance also applies to the site.
26

Redevelopment Plan

2 21. Under Community Redevelopment Law ("CRL"), Health and Safety Code
sections 33000 et seq., redevelopment agencies were created to eliminate blight and increase the
supply of affordable housing in a manner that cannot be accomplished by private enterprises
alone. (Health & Saf. Code §§ 33030, 33037, 33320.1.) The City created the Community
6 Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles in accordance with CRL.

7 22. The City's Community Redevelopment Agency adopted the
8 Hoover/Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Plan and its amendments ("Redevelopment
9 Plan"). The Redevelopment Plan applies to the Project site. The Project site is part of
10 expansion area #4 that was added to the Redevelopment Plan on May 10, 1983.
11 23. The Redevelopment Plan governs all development within its boundaries including
12 design, aesthetics, parking, density and density bonuses. When there is a conflict between
13 zoning and the Redevelopment Plan, the Redevelopment Plan controls.
14 24. The Redevelopment Plan sets the base density for sites within the plan area.
15 Under the Redevelopment Plan, the Project site's land use designation of Low Medium II
16 Residential allows 24 dwelling units per gross acre, which equates to 67 dwelling units for the
17 Project site. This exceeds the 83 dwelling unit base density, based upon zoning, that was relied
18 upon for the City when approving the Project.

19 25. Density bonuses are allowed under the Redevelopment Plan, but require specific
20 findings be made before any increase above the base density can be approved. The required
21 findings are that the Agency approval of such development shall:
22 1) Contribute to the revitalization goals of the Plan.
23 2) Contribute to a desirable residential environment, neighborhood stability, and
24 not adversely impact the neighboring environment.
25 3) Provide units with adequate living area and avoid excessively dense
26 development.
27 4) Provide adequate parking.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. Redevelopment plans had previously been under the authority of the Community
2 Redevelopment Agency, but all redevelopment agencies were dissolved as a matter of law on

February 1, 2012, pursuant to legislation that amended the CRL. Initially after the dissolution,

4 the CRA/LA became the successor agency tasked with enforcement of redevelopment plans
within the City.
27. On September 30, 2019, the City adopted Ordinance #186325 entitled "Unexpired
7 Redevelopment Project Areas/Community Redevelopment Agency Los Angeles
8 Il (CRA/LA)/Transfer of Land Use Authority" with an effective date of November 11, 2019. This

9 ordinance transfers authority from CRA/LA to the City's Planning Department to implement the
10 provisions of the Redevelopment Plan. The ordinance changes what entity administers
11 redevelopment plans and processes, but the requirements of the plans remain unchanged and the
12 provisions of the plans continue to take precedence over the provisions of the City's zoning
13 code. In the ordinance the City also recognizes and adopts the Community Redevelopment
14 Agency historic surveys.
15

16 Historic Neighborhood

17 28. The Redevelopment Plan is intended to encourage development that reinforces the
18 character-defining features of neighborhoods and to coordinate decade's long efforts to
19 understand and recognize the historic significance of University Park and protect it from
20 incompatible development.

21 29. The Redevelopment Plan, as required by state law, provides a survey of historic
22 assets within the Redevelopment Plan area. In 2005, historic resources expert Peter Moruzzi

23 prepared the "Historic Assessment Survey Report, Historic Resources Survey Update, Hoover
24 Redevelopment Project Area," for the City's Community Redevelopment Agency. This survey
25 identifies a number of historic resources in the neighborhood surrounding the Project site,
26 including the Fraternity/Sorority Row Historic District immediately to the south of the Project
27 site, which consists of two-story buildings in various architectural styles. This historic survey
28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

was publicly reviewed, and then codified and published by the Community Redevelopment
2 Agency in March 2006.

30.

4 Numerous historic resources surround the site as do significant other "overlays"
that were established to achieve environmental goals and protection of, not only historic
5 resources, but also the character-defining features of the University Park neighborhood. This
6 Automobile Club map highlights some of the surrounding historic resources:

20 St. John's Episcopal Church; the Stimson Residence; the Doheny Mansion and the Shankland

21 House.

22 32. In addition to the resources shown on this map are several historic districts and

23 overlay zones for both local and federal historic districts.

24 33. The University Park Historic Preservation Overlay Zone ("HPOZ") is located

25 across Adams Boulevard from the Project site. Within the University Park HPOZ and directly

26 across Adams are two National Register Historic Districts: the St. James Park National Register

27 Historic District (1991) and the Chester Place National Register Historic District (eligible 1986).

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. Less than two blocks to the west of the Project site and just across Hoover Street is
2 the North University Park Specific Plan, which functions as an HPOZ and also contains two

3 National Register Historic Districts. The most eastern one, the North University Park National

4 Register Historic District (2005) occupies the south-side of West Adams Boulevard from
5 Hoover Street to Magnolia and south from Adams Boulevard to 28th Street along the west side
6 of Hoover Street. To the south and at the rear of the subject property is the USC
7 Fraternity/Sorority Row Historic District.

9 South Los Angeles Community Plan
10 35. The South Los Angeles Community Plan ("Community Plan") was adopted in
11 November 2017. The Community Plan covers an approximately 15 square mile area located
12 three miles southwest of downtown.

13 36. The Community Plan is a component of the City's General Plan and is enforceable
14 a as a General Plan.

15 37. The Community Plan recognizes the rich history of this area of the City and the
16 need to protect its historic character. The Community Plan stresses avoiding incompatible
17 intrusions in residential areas. It emphasizes the need to: "[p]rotect[] residential neighborhoods
18 from increased development pressure" and to "[s]eek a high degree of architectural
19 compatibility and landscaping for new infill development to protect the historical and
20 architectural character and scale of existing residential neighborhoods, including front yard
21 fence location, design, and materials."

22 38. The Community Plan requires that "new development should explore the existing
23 development patterns, infrastructure, street systems, urban design, architectural features and
24 historical resources in order to maintain community context."

25

26 Neighborhood Stabilization Ordinance
27 39. In addition to being surrounded by historic resources, the Project site is also

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adjacent to family-oriented residential neighborhoods. Over the years, the increasing amount of
2 student housing being developed in the University Park neighborhood began adversely
3 impacting this neighborhood.

4 40. To address the potential incompatibility of student housing with the surrounding
5 neighborhood, the City adopted the Neighborhood Stabilization Ordinance ("NSO") on October
6 2, 2008. The overlay zone adopted by the NSO was intended to address the unique needs of the
7 University Park neighborhood. The Project site is located with the NSO overlay, requiring
8 discretionary approval of a Conditional Use and special considerations in the approval of the
Project.
10 41. The NSO promotes well-planned housing to meet the needs of college/university
11 student housing and the needs of the community. It addresses impacts of multiple-habitable
12 room projects, which may be incompatible with surrounding development due to noise, traffic,
13 lack of parking and design incompatibility. The NSO encourages thoughtfully designed
14 developments with adequate parking and requires individual review for proposed large multiple-
15 habitable room projects to assure that the project provides adequate on-site parking and
16 addresses a concentration of campus-serving housing in the vicinity.
17

18 History of Project Site
19 42. The Project site was first developed as the site of the former residence and farm of
20 Caroline Severance and her son, Mark Sibley Severance. The Severance Residence, which was
21 later demolished, was known as "The Big Red House" and was included in the book "The
22 Mansions of Los Angeles," which noted the many elegant homes along Adams Boulevard, now
23 a City scenic highway.
24 43. The Project site later became the location of the renowned John Tracy Clinic.
25 44. The John Tracy Clinic is a private, nonprofit education center for infants and
26 preschool children with hearing loss. The Clinic has provided education and support for children
27 with hearing loss and their families for over 70 years and has helped numerous children develop
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 speech, language and listening abilities. It was founded by Louise Treadwell Tracy, wife of
2 actor Spencer Tracy, in 1942. The Clinic is named after Louise and Spencer Tracy's son, John,

3 who was hearing impaired. Thus, the John Tracy Clinic is renowned not only for its work in
4 children's hearing impairment, but also for its association with Hollywood royalty.

5 45. In 1954 the John Tracy Clinic built the first of three buildings, followed by a
6| building in 1956, then an addition in 1974. Two of the buildings were demolished in a separate a
7 permit application in 2017 prior to Real Parties ownership of the Project site.

8 46. The John Tracy Clinic announced in its March 8, 2018 Newsletter that "we will
9 transition into a new modern facility just down the street from the existing campus." The John
10 Tracy Clinic changed its name to the John Tracy Center and announced opening its doors at the

11 new site in fall 2019. During the transition move, according to a June 4, 2018 "Curbed LA"
12 article, the Clinic continued to lease space at the original site.
13 47. Since two of the buildings are no longer extant, it is impossible to assess their
14 historic significance. However, the 1954 and 1956 building dates establish they were over 50
15 years old, associated with legendary people, and were possibly significant.

16 48. One building developed for the John Tracy Clinic remains, the 1974 building to
17 the east. On March 21, 2019, a demolition application was submitted for this building. The
18 permit has not been cleared by the City, presumably because it is part of a larger project, the
19 Champion Project.
20

21 The Project

22 49. On January 9, 2018, Real Party in Interest Robert Champion formed 806 West
23 Adams, LLC. On February 8, 2018, Real Party in Interest Champion Real Estate Company
24 announced its acquisition of the Project site, with ownership subsequently assumed by Real
25 Party in Interest 806 West Adams, LLC.
26 50. The Project proposed by Real Parties in Interest and approved by the City is a 102-
27 unit residential development. The Project includes 99 student housing units, each with at least

28

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

five bedrooms, plus two three-bedroom workforce housing units on 2.75 acres of land. In total,
2 the Project will construct 183,150 square feet of new floor area.

3 51. The 102 units would be developed in six buildings, with three stories of residential
4 units seated atop at grade podium parking plus a seventh four-story clubhouse building at the

5 corner of Adams Boulevard and Severance Street. Rooftop party decks would be provided on
6 the buildings for use by the tenants.
52. Out of the 102 units, only five would provide restricted affordable very low-
8 income housing. Additionally, only 259 parking spaces would be provided, despite the Project
9 supporting 495 to 1,000 tenants.
10 53. The Project requires discretionary approval of Site Plan Review, a Conditional
11 Use approval and Density Bonus incentives from the City, necessitating CEQA compliance.
12 54. While initially acknowledging the Project was intended to provide student
13 housing, the Real Parties subsequently claimed the Project would provide USC faculty and staff
14 housing. However, the plans for the Project make clear the Project is intended as student
15 housing. The units are designed around a very small amount of common space in the living
16 room and kitchen, with five large dorm-style bedrooms. The majority of the bedrooms are

17 divided into a suite like arrangement, with the bedroom containing space for bed on each side
18 of a bathroom located within the suite.

19 55. The USC Land Use and Planning Executive Director submitted comments that the
20 Project is clearly intended as student housing. This type of housing unit will not provide the
21 greatly needed housing for USC faculty and staff, nor family housing generally.
22

23 Administrative Process for the Project
24 56. Real Parties in Interest submitted an application for the Project in April 2018.
25 57. The public became aware of the Project through a "Curbed LA" article and
26 November 2018 press release from Real Parties in Interest, although both referred to the Project
27 as USC faculty and staff housing, instead of student housing.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

58. After there was public knowledge of the plans, given the massive impact of the
2 development and the discretionary actions required, efforts were made to require the developer
to meet with the community. The Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood
4 Development Council ("NANDC"), the elected neighborhood council that comments on land

5 use in the area surrounding USC, including the Project site, scheduled a public meeting before

6 its Policy Committee to discuss the Project.
59. On November 27, 2018, Real Parties in Interest met with the NANDC Policy

8 Committee. The initial reaction by the Committee members raised a variety of issues: that this
9 is dormitory style not family housing, that affordable units will not be affordable for South LA
10 residents, that there will be increased traffic and inadequate parking, that the Project is
11 incompatible with the historic neighborhood, and the Project fails to comply with the NSO,
12 Community Plan and Redevelopment Plan. The NANDC Committee raised design issues and
13 questioned the appropriate level of environmental review under CEQA. The NANDC
14 Committee stated it looked forward to engaging in a meaningful a discussion with the developer
15 to address these concerns.

16 60. On December 19, 2018, a Zoning Administrator hearing was held for the Project
17 to review the discretionary actions required: the categorical exemption, the Conditional Use
18 under the NSO, the Density Bonus, and Site Plan Review. Numerous experts in historic
19 I preservation, WAHA, the North University Park Community Association ("NUPCA"), the
20 Adams Dockweiler Heritage Organizing Committee ("ADHOC"), USC and other members of
21 the public genuinely concerned about the impact this development would have on the
22 surrounding community provided comments at the Zoning Administrator hearing.

23 61. The Assistant Zoning Administrator ("AZA") for the Project, Henry Chu, agreed
24 to keep the record open for the Project until January 4, 2019 so that NANDC could process the
25 various discretionary requests and evaluate the Project in the time line allowed by the NANDC
26 Bylaws.
27 62. On December 20, 2018, the NANDC Policy Committee again met with the
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L developer team. However, there were no changes to the plans that had been presented on
2 November 27, 2018. Because the issues raised by the NANDC Policy Committee were not
3 addressed, the NANDC Board adopted the Policy Committee's recommendation to oppose the
4 development in its present form. NANDC submitted its position letter to the City on January 4,
2019.

6 63. On February 14, 2019, another official City body, the University Park HPOZ
7 Board, advised AZA Chu that environmental review should be required because the Project
may result in adverse impacts to historic resources. The University Park HPOZ Board also
9 critiqued the Project for failing to consider the potential for impacts on the HPOZ, the North
10 University Park Specific Plan, the Fraternity Sorority Row surveyed historic district, and its
11 importance within the Redevelopment Project Area.
12 64. On May 17, 2019, AZA Chu rendered his decision, approving a 20 percent
13 Density Bonus and the Conditional Use approval under the NSO, but denying the Site Plan
14 Review. His written decision noted the inherent incompatibility of the Project with the
15 surrounding neighborhood, due to its design and lack of pedestrian focus. The scale, massing
16 and podium parking were found to conflict with the surrounding neighborhood. The decision
17 also described the potential noise impacts that would result from the rooftop decks.
18 65. The Zoning Administrator decision triggered two appeals. NUPCA appealed,
19 opposing approval of the Conditional Use under the NSO, the Density Bonus and the
20 categorical exemption. The developer also submitted an appeal, opposing the denial of the Site
21 Plan Review.

22 66. On August 6, 2019, a hearing on the Project appeals was scheduled before the
23 South Area Planning Commission ("SAPC"). Due to the inclusion of a density bonus in the
24 discretionary actions, the City Attorney advised the SAPC that proper jurisdiction was the City
25 Planning Commission and the appeals were rescheduled for hearing before that body.
26 67. On October 10, 2019, the City Planning Commission conducted a hearing on the
27 two appeals.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

68. Prior to the appeal hearing, the developer had made a couple of minor cosmetic
2 changes to the Project, adding some screening and stuccoing the metal garage podium, adding a
3 small entrance on Adams, and changing the number and placement of the rooftop decks.

4 69. Despite these minimal changes lacking the ability to rectify the Project flaws
5 found in the Zoning Administrator decision, the City Planning Commission voted to approve
6 the Project. In doing so, the City Planning Commission disregarded expert testimony
7 submitted by Petitioners and other members of the community, both verbally and in writing, in
8 some instances, dismissing this information because it was not in the form of a report. The City
9 Planning Commission also failed to acknowledge that the Project is intended to provide student
10 housing, not family housing.

11 70. On November 20, 2019, the City Planning Commission issued its Letter of
12 Determination denying the NUPCA appeal and upholding the developer's appeal of the site
13 plan review denial.
14 71. On November 27, 2019, NUPCA and the Adams Severance Coalition appealed
15 the CEQA determination, reliance on a categorical exemption for the Project, to City Council.
16 72. A Corrected Letter of Determination was issued by the City Planning
17 Commission on December 11, 2019, correcting the approved number of dwelling units to 102
18 instead of 99 units.

19 73. The appeal was heard by the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management
20 ("PLUM") Committee on January 21, 2020. Significant evidence was presented by historic
21 preservation experts to the PLUM Committee regarding the Project's adverse impacts on the
22  historic setting of surrounding historic resources and districts.
23 74. The PLUM Committee recommended denial of the appeal and forwarded it to
24 City Council.
25 75. The appeal was scheduled for consideration by the City Council on February 4,
26 2020. Although speaker cards were submitted on the item at the hearing, the City Council
27 approved denial of the appeal as a consent item and did not take any testimony.

28

1 76. As of the time of the filing of this Petition, Petitioners have been unable to
2 ascertain whether a notice a of exemption was posted for the Project.
3

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

6

7 77. Petitioners WAHA and the Adams Severance Coalition objected to the Project in
the administrative process by submitting letters during the comment period and providing
testimony at public meetings regarding the Project. The Adams Severance Coalition, along with
10 the North University Park Community Association, appealed the Project approvals
11 administratively and WAHA supported those appeals.
12 78. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
13  unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of
14 such remedies, the City's approval of the Project would form the basis for a development project
15 that would proceed in violation of state law.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

27 82. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 83. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
2 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004). §
3 The City has failed to do so for the Project, in violation of CEQA.

4 84. The City has relied on a Class 32 categorical exemption to approve the Project,
5 under CEQA Guidelines § 15332. The City's reliance on this categorical exemption is legally
6 inadequate for several reasons, including but not limited to the following.

7

8 The City Failed to Prove the Project Fits Within a Categorical Exemption

9 85. Class 32 categorical exemptions exempts in-fill projects from environmental review
10 if the following conditions have been met:
11 a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
12 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
13 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than
14 five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.

15 (c) The project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
16 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,
17 noise, air quality, or water quality.
18 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
19 (CEQA Guidelines § 15332.)
20 86. Categorical exemptions may be provided only for "classes of projects which have
21 been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment...." and should be construed
22 in light of that authorization. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21084, subd. (a).)
23 87. Categorical exemptions are strictly construed, "in order to afford the fullest
24 possible environmental protection." (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water
25 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.) It is the City's burden to prove that the
26 proposed Project fits within this class of categorical exemption. (California Farm Bureau Fed'n
27 v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd., (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 185-86.) The City has
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 failed to meet its burden in proving the Project correctly fits within a Class 32 categorical
2 exemption.

3 88. The Project does not fit within this class of categorical exemption for several
4 reasons. First, the Project is not consistent with applicable land use plans and regulations.
5 89. The Project site is located within the Hoover-Exposition/University Park
6 Redevelopment Plan area, and the regulations contained in this plan supersede other zoning
7 regulations for the area. The a Project is inconsistent with a number of Redevelopment Plan
policies.

90. Under the Redevelopment Plan, the base number of dwelling units allowed at the
10 Project site is 67 units. (Redevelopment Plan §1304.) The Project is inconsistent with this
11 regulation because it assumed a base density of 83 units.
12 91. The Redevelopment Plan prohibits development of more than the base number of
13 units unless specific findings can and have been made. These required findings are that the
14 project would: "1) Contribute to the revitalization goals of the Plan. 2) Contribute to a desirable a
15 residential environment, neighborhood stability, and not adversely impact the neighboring
16 environment. 3) Provide units with adequate living area and avoid excessively dense
17 development. 4) Provide appropriate parking." (Redevelopment Plan §1306.) The Project
18 includes 102 units, far in excess of the density set by the Redevelopment Plan. The City has not
19 and cannot make these required findings to exceed the base density for the site set by the
20 Redevelopment Plan, thus the Project is inconsistent with the Redevelopment Plan and a Class
21 32 exemption is unavailable.
22 92. The Project is also inconsistent with the Redevelopment Plan because it includes
23 only six percent of the units as affordable housing. The Redevelopment Plan requires at least 15
24| percent of new development in the Redevelopment Plan area to collectively be affordable units.
25 The City is already below this required level of affordable units, and this Project would put it
26 further out of compliance with this Redevelopment Plan regulation.
27 93. A Class 32 exemption is also unavailable because the Project is inconsistent with
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the City's NSO. The NSO overlay, which includes the Project site, was established to prevent
2 further impacts from student housing on the neighborhood by establishing regulations for multi-
3 habitable room projects, such as this Project, including regulations to address inadequate parking

4 and prevent irreversible damage associated with oversized multi-habitable room projects. (Los
5 Angeles Municipal Code §13.12(A).) Under the NSO, the Project is required to "provide one

6 additional parking space for each habitable room at or above five habitable rooms." (Los
7 Angeles Municipal Code §13.12(C)(2).) The Project fails to provide additional parking spaces
8 for the 99 or more units that include at least five habitable rooms, making it inconsistent with the
9 NSO regulations for the site.
10 94. The Project is further inconsistent with policies and goals set forth in the South
11 Los Angeles Community Plan, including, but not limited to, the Community Plan's goal that
12 "Projects should contribute to reinforcing the distinctive and historical character of the corridors
13 and the residential neighborhoods they serve." (South LA Community Plan. p. 3-6.) The
14 Project is inconsistent with the Community Plan's policies requiring it to be architecturally
15 compatible with the surrounding historic neighborhood and, due to its podium parking and lack
16 of pedestrian friendly design, policies requiring projects to be consistent with the Community
17 Plan's design guidelines.
18 95. West Adams Boulevard is designated a scenic highway by the City's General
19 Plan. The General Plan Mobility Element subjects scenic highways to special controls for
20 I protection and enhancement of scenic resources. West Adams Boulevard was designated as a
21 scenic highway because it traverses an urban area of cultural, historical and aesthetic value that
22 merit protection and enhancement. The Project is inconsistent with these requirements because it
23 detracts from this scenic highway instead of protecting and enhancing it.
24 96. The Project may also result in adverse traffic and noise impacts that prevent
a 25 reliance on a Class 32 exemption. The Project is severely under-parked, providing only 259
26 parking spaces for a project that will include up to 1,000 residents. The Land Use and Planning
27 Executive Director from USC submitted expert comments detailing the traffic impacts that have
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 19 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 resulted from other student housing projects with inadequate parking and explaining how the
2 impacts would be even greater from this Project due to the existing lack of parking and
3 substantial lack of parking provided by the Project. Project residents would be required to
4 search for on-street parking in the Adams Boulevard vicinity, resulting in traffic congestion and
5 safety risks for pedestrians.

6 97. Substantial evidence was also submitted regarding the adverse noise impacts that
7 would result from the Project's rooftop party decks. Experienced student housing providers
8 commented on the irregularity of such rooftop space and the lack of compatibility with the
surrounding residential neighborhood due to the noise that would be generated by college
10 students on the rooftop party decks. The Zoning Administrator decision also cited concerns
11 regarding the noise impacts of these rooftop amenities on the surrounding quiet, family-oriented
12 residential neighborhood.

13 98. For all of these reasons, the Project does not fit within a Class 32 categorical
14 exemption.
15

16 Exceptions to Categorical Exemption Apply
17 99. Even if the Project did fit within the Class 32 exemption, the exemption would be
18 inapplicable because several exceptions to categorical exemptions apply. (CEQA Guidelines §

19 15300.2.)
20 100. "A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a
21 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource." (CEQA Guidelines §
22 15300.2, subd. (f), emphasis added.)

23 101. The Project is located along the historic West Adams Boulevard, surrounded by
24 numerous historic resources including: the adjacent Kerckhoff House; the adjacent Waters-Shaw
25 Family Residence; the University Park Historic Preservation Overlay Zone; the St. James and
26 Chester Place National Register Historic Districts; the Automobile Club; St. Vincent de Paul
27 Church; the historic North University Park Specific Plan area; and the Fraternity and Sorority
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Row historic district. Several historic preservation experts submitted evidence regarding the
2 adverse impacts the Project would have on the important historic setting for these resources due
3 in part to its lack of compatibility with the historic streetscape setting of West Adams

4 Boulevard.

5 102. This expert testimony presents a fair argument supported by substantial evidence
6 that the Project may have significant adverse impacts on historic resources. Thus, a categorical

7 exemption is not available.

8 103. A categorical exemption is also "inapplicable when the cumulative impact of

9 successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant." (CEQA
10 Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (b).) The South Los Angeles Community Plan found that multi-
11 family projects have been developed in this area that are incompatible with the character and
12 quality of design of the neighborhood. The Project would add to the adverse aesthetic, historic
13 and land use impacts from incompatible development, resulting in a cumulatively considerable
14 impact.
15 104. The Project would also result in cumulatively considerable impacts from multi-
16 habitable room projects, such as traffic and noise. These impacts had become so prevalent that
17 the City adopted the NSO to address the adverse impacts, acknowledging an existing
18 cumulatively significant impact. The Project would further add to these impacts because it fails
19| to comply with the requirements of the NSO.
20 105. A categorical exemption is further inapplicable when "there is a reasonable
21 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
22 circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c).) This Project is unlike the typical
23 project for which the Class 32 categorical exemption was developed due to the surrounding
24 historic neighborhood and the applicable NSO and Redevelopment Plan to which the Project
25 does not conform. These unusual circumstances result in a reasonable possibility the Project
26 may have a significant adverse impact, preventing reliance on a categorical exemption.
27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Categorical Exemptions Cannot Be Used If Mitigation Is Required
2 106. A categorical exemption for this Project is also improper because the City relied
on mitigation measures to approve the Project. "An agency should decide whether a project is
4 eligible for a categorical exemption as part of its preliminary review of the project without

5 reference to or reliance upon any proposed mitigation measures" (Salmon Protection &
Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1106.) Reliance on such
7 measures "involves an evaluative process ...and that process must be conducted under
8 established CEQA standards and procedures for EIRs or negative declarations." (Id. at 1108.)
107. The Zoning Administrator decision acknowledged the Project's incompatibility
10 with surrounding development, finding that the Project's scale and massing and podium parking
11 would not be comparable to any residential project in the immediate area. The rooftop amenities
12 were also found to overwhelm adjacent multi-family buildings.
13 108. In an attempt to mitigate these impacts, the Project was conditioned upon a
14 number of modifications. The conditions of approval require development in accordance with
15 site plans that were revised to create a less modern design and attempt to camouflage the steel
16 podium parking level.
17 109. The Zoning Administrator also found the Project could have adverse noise
18 impacts on the surrounding residential neighborhood. Conditions of approval were then devised
19 to set hours of operation for the rooftop shared open space in an attempt to address the concerns
20 raised regarding noise impacts. Additionally, the Project was revised to relocate the rooftop
21 open space to more interior portions of the Project site in an attempt to address this impact.
22 110. The conditions of approval were found to be necessary to reverse the Zoning
23 Administrators partial denial of the Project. The City relied upon these conditions to mitigate
24 potential impacts and as such, reliance on a categorical exemption is improper.
25

26 The City Deferred Mitigation

27 111. The Redevelopment Plan requires findings that a project that exceeds the base
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

density set by the Plan would be compatible with and would not have adverse impacts on the
2 surrounding neighborhood, would avoid excessively dense development and would provide
3 adequate parking. These discretionary findings require analysis and potential mitigation of
4 adverse impacts associated with projects in the Redevelopment Plan area.

5 112. Instead of conducting the required analysis and mitigation prior to approving the
6 Project, the City improperly deferred analysis and mitigation by simply imposing a condition

7 that the Project's compatibility with the Redevelopment Plan would be determined post-
8 approval.
113. This deferral of analysis and development of mitigation measures violates CEQA.
10 (Endangered Habitats League v County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal. App. 4th 777, 793-94;
11 CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(B).) CEQA requires all mitigation measures for a
12 project to be formulated during the environmental review process SO their efficacy can be
13 analyzed in the environmental review document. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County
14 of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 669-670.)
15

16 The City Improperly Segmented Redevelopment Agency Review

17 114. The City's delay in determining the Project's consistency with the
18 Redevelopment Plan is also improper project segmentation. The whole of the project should
19 have been considered at the time of Project approval. Instead, the City improperly segmented
20 this discretionary determination, which could require CEQA review, until after Project approval.
21

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (VIOLATIONS OF PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

24 115. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
25 the previous paragraphs.
26 116. The Government Code imposes upon the City a clear, present and mandatory duty
27 to ensure consistency of project approvals with the General Plan
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 23 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 117. The South Los Angeles Community Plan is a component of the City's General
2 Plan. The City was required, but failed, to ensure the Project was consistent with the South Los
Angeles Community Plan's policies, including, but not limited to, the following.
118. Policy LU 4.1 requires "a high degree of architectural compatibility and
landscaping for new infill development to protect the historical and architectural character and

6 scale of existing residential neighborhoods, including front yard fence location, design, and

7 materials." The Project is inconsistent with this policy because it is incompatible with the
8 architectural character and prevailing setbacks and size of existing development. Its lack of
9 pedestrian friendly design is incompatible with the existing character of West Adams Boulevard.
10 119. Policy LU 4.3 also requires new multi-family residential developments to be
11 designed in accordance with the South Los Angeles Community Plan design guidelines. These
12 guidelines prohibit visible ground level parking. The Project's podium parking design violates
13 this guideline. The design guidelines also require development to be sensitive to the
14| neighborhood context and to provide a pedestrian orientation on West Adams Boulevard, neither
15 of which is followed by the Project. The Project further violates the design guidelines by
16 overwhelming the surrounding neighborhood with its scale and massing.
17

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (VIOLATIONS OF CITY MUNICIPAL CODE)
20 120. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
21 the previous paragraphs.

22 121. The approval of a Conditional Use to permit the Project requires findings to be
23 made, including that the Project is consistent with applicable land use plans. (Los Angeles
24 Municipal Code 12.24-E.) The City found the Project was consistent with applicable land use
25 plans, but this finding is unsupported because the City deferred analysis of whether the Project
26 was consistent with the Redevelopment Plan until after approval of the Conditional Use for the
27 Project.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

122. Further, as set forth above, the Project is not consistent with the Redevelopment
2 Plan because it exceeds the base density for the site allowed by the Redevelopment Plan, but
3 does not, and could not, make the findings required to exceed this base density. This

4 discretionary determination could only be made after a public hearing addressing the Project's
consistency with the Redevelopment Plan and analyzing the ability to make the required

6 findings. Such a hearing was not held prior to Project approval.

7 123. The Project also required approval of Site Plan Review. To approve Site Plan
8 Review, the City was required to find that the Project conforms to applicable land use plans, is

9 compatible with surrounding development, provides adequate off-street parking, and minimizes
10 impacts on the surrounding neighborhood. (Los Angeles Municipal Code 16.05-F.) As
11 discussed above, these findings cannot be made.
12 124. The Los Angeles Municipal Code also requires that when multiple entitlements
13 are required for the same project, including a determination of consistency with the
14 Redevelopment Plan, that applications for the entitlements "shall be submitted and processed
15 concurrently." (Los Angeles Municipal Code 11.5.14.) The City violated this Municipal Code
16 requirement by segmenting the approval of the Project under the Redevelopment Plan from the
17 remainder of the entitlements required for the Project. The developer did not apply for, and the
18 City did not consider, the required discretionary project compliance to determine whether the
19 Project complies with the regulations, findings, standards and provisions of the Redevelopment
20 Plan prior to Project approval of the Conditional Use, Site Plan Review and Density Bonus in
21 violation of the City's Municipal Code.
22

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 In each of the respects enumerated above, the City has violated its duties under law,
25 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters
26 complained of without the support of substantial evidence.
27 WHEREFORE, Petitioners prays for relief as follows:
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 25 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1. For a Peremptory Writ of Mandate, commanding the City and its agencies and
2 commissions to set aside and void any approvals for the Project and to require the preparation of
3 legally adequate environmental review before any reapproval of the Project.
4 2. For an order enjoining and/or staying the City and Real Parties in Interest from

5 taking any action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in
any way that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment, including the
7 surrounding community, unless and until a lawful approval is obtained from City after the
8 I preparation and consideration of legally adequate environmental review and a determination that
9 the City's approval is consistent with the Hoover-Exposition/University Park Redevelopment
10 Plan and the South Los Angeles Community Plan and in compliance with the requirements of
11 the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

12 3. For Petitioners' costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
13 section 1021.5; and

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act;
West Adams Heritage Association v. City of Los Angeles

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the City of Los Angeles' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) in approving the 102-unit student housing development along the historic West
Adams Boulevard. The City has improperly relied upon a categorical exemption to
approving this project, which would have adverse impacts on surrounding historic
resources and the historic character of the neighborhood. Noise and traffic from the
severely under-parked student housing project would also adversely impact the adjacent
family-oriented residential neighborhood. The project also fails to comply with the
Hoover/Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Plan and Los Angeles Municipal
Code provisions intended to protect historic resources and the surrounding residential
community.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public
Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act;
West Adams Heritage Association v. City of Los Angeles

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the City of Los Angeles' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in approving the 102-unit student housing development along the historic West Adams Boulevard. The City has improperly relied upon a categorical exemption to approving this project, which would have adverse impacts on surrounding historic
resources and the historic character of the neighborhood. Noise and traffic from the severely under-parked student housing project would also adversely impact the adjacent family-oriented residential neighborhood. The project also fails to comply with the Hoover/Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Plan and Los Angeles Municipal Code provisions intended to protect historic resources and the surrounding residential
community.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public
Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
gllt Amy Minteer
