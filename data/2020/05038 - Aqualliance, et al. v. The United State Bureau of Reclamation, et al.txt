- Petitioners and Plaintiffs AquAlliance, California Sportfishing Protection Alliance,
2 California Water Impact Network, Central Delta Water Agency and South Delta Water Agency
3 (collectively, "Plaintiffs" or "Petitioners") hereby allege as follows:

4 I. INTRODUCTION

5 1.

6 This is a civil suit brought pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act

7 ("NEPA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), 5 U.S.C. §§

8 701 et seq., and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§

9 21000 et seq., and the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"), 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531 et seq.
2.

10 This action is brought by several California water resource management and

11 conservation organizations to challenge defendants' environmental review and approval of a

12 2019-2024 water transfer program to move water from sellers located upstream of the

13 Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta ("Delta") to willing buyers south of the Delta (the "Project").

14 These water transfers would drain both surface and groundwater resources from the Sacramento

15 River and San Joaquin River watersheds, imposing significant and irreversible threats to the

16 people and sensitive species that rely on these water resources and associated aquatic and riparian

babitats.

17 3. The Project will likely have devastating impacts to the Delta. The Delta faces
18 interrelated problems of inadequate water supplies, instream flow deficits, water quality

19 impairments, and degraded aquatic habitats. This Project would worsen those existing problems
20 by further reducing freshwater flows into the Delta.

21 4.

22 The Project would also have detrimental effects on groundwater by relying in part
on "groundwater substitution" for these transfers with an inaccurate characterization of existing
23 conditions, and wholly ineffective mitigation measures. These adverse groundwater effects will, in
24 turn, adversely affect connected surface water and habitats.

25 5. This action arises following the District Court's judgment in 2018 vacating and
26 a setting aside a similar but distinct 10-year water transfer program and associated environmental
27 documents originally approved in 2015. Following the District Court's vacatur, USBR and
28 SLDMWA assessed the Project in a Revised Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental

First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 3 of 37

Impact Report ("EIS/EIR") prepared for both NEPA and CEQA purposes. However, the EIS/EIR
2 only attempts to minimally rectify past adjudicated mistakes, rather than informing the public of

3 the Project's real impacts. USBR and SLDMWA have failed to provide an accurate description of
4 the Project, made nakedly unenforceable promises about operation of the Project, failed to account

5 for a plethora of new information and changed circumstances that have come about since

6 environmental review for the ten-year transfer program was evaluated, and doubled down on prior
7 analytical deficiencies.

8 6. Simply put, it is not 2015, and much has changed since then. The current proposed
9 Project is markedly different than the one originally contemplated over five years ago, having
10 been significantly changed in scope. California and the Project area are not as they were when
11 environmental analysis for the original project was conducted, yet the EIS/EIR has flagrantly
12 cobbled together pieces of the invalidated 2015 EIS/EIR interwoven with fragmented updates
13 from the 2019 EIS/EIR. The conditions the original project was evaluated against no longer exist.
14 7. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS") prepared an inadequate
15 biological opinion ("BiOp") that fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on giant garter
16 snake ("GGS") or explain how proposed conservation measures will avoid jeopardy to that
17 species.

18 8. As a result of these numerous and compounding deficiencies, the Project put forth

19 by the Defendants poses a significant threat to the Delta, Sacramento River and Valley, other

20 water resources in California, and the public is left uninformed of these impacts.

21 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22 9. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1331 (federal question), 28
23 U.S.C § 1346 (United States as defendant), 28 U.S.C § 2201 (declaratory relief), 28 U.S.C § 2202
24 (injunctive relief), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.

25 10. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims pursuant to 28
26 U.S.C. § 1367(a) because the state law claims are related to the federal law claims and form part
27 of the same case or controversy. Such state law claims include a claim under the California

28

First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 4 of 37

1 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., and California Code of Civil
2 Procedure §§ 1060, 1085, 1088.5, and 1094.5.

3 11. Venue is appropriate in the Eastern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §

4 1391(e) because defendant USBR is located in Sacramento County, and a substantial part of the
5 events or omissions giving rise to the claims alleged in this Complaint occurred and will continue
6 to occur in this judicial district.

7 12. This complaint is timely filed within any and all applicable statutes of limitations.
8 III. INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT

9 13. Pursuant to Local Rule 120(d), intradistrict assignment of this matter to the
10 Sacramento, Redding, or Fresno Divisions of the Court would be appropriate in that the events or
11 omissions which give rise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred, are occurring, and/or will occur in Butte,
12 Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Kings, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Benito, San Joaquin, Santa Clara,
13 Shasta, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Yolo, and Yuba Counties.

14 IV. PARTIES

15 14. Petitioner and Plaintiff AQUALLIANCE is a California Public Benefit Corporation
16 organized to protect waters in the northern Sacramento River's watershed to sustain family farms,
17 communities, creeks and rivers, native flora and fauna, vernal pools, and recreation. AquAlliance
18 has approximately 637 members who rely on Sacramento Valley groundwater for their livelihoods
19 and live, recreate and work in and around waters of the State of California, including the
20 Sacramento River, its tributaries, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay Delta ("Bay Delta").
21 AquAlliance's mission is to defend northern California waters and to challenge threats to the
22 hydrologic health of the Sacramento River watershed. AquAlliance is especially focused on
23 confronting the escalating attempts to divert more and more water from the northern Sacramento
24 River hydrologic region to other parts of California.

25 15. Petitioner and Plaintiff CALIFORNIA SPORTFISHING PROTECTION
26 ALLIANCE ("CSPA") is a non-profit public benefit corporation organized under the laws of the
27 State of California with its main office in Stockton, California. CSPA has approximately 2000
28 members who live, recreate and work in and around waters of the State of California, including the

3
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 5 of 37

r Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, the Delta, Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay. CSPA is
2 dedicated to the preservation, protection, and defense of the environment, the wildlife and the
3 natural resources of all waters of California. To further these goals, CSPA actively seeks federal

4 and state agency implementation of the Act and other laws and, where necessary, directly initiates
5 enforcement actions on behalf of itself and its members. CSPA has been actively engaged in

6 proceedings relating to the environmental impact of the SWP as well as the federal Central Valley
7 Project ("CVP").

8 16. Petitioner and Plaintiff CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK ("C-WIN")
9 is a California non-profit public benefit organization with its principal place of business in Santa
10 Barbara, California. C-WIN's organization purpose is the protection and restoration of fish and

11 wildlife resources, scenery, water quality, recreational opportunities, agricultural uses, and other
12 natural environmental resources and uses of the rivers and streams of California, including the
13 Bay-Delta, its watershed and its underlying groundwater resources. C-WIN has members who

14 reside in, use, and enjoy the Bay-Delta and inhabit and use its watershed. They use the rivers of
15 the Central Valley and the Bay-Delta for nature study, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment. C-WIN

16 and its members have been involved in the administrative proceedings that have been provided to
17 date for the EIR/EIS, each discussed, below, including providing written comments.

18 17. Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTRAL DELTA WATER AGENCY ("CDWA") is a
19 political subdivision of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the
20 Central Delta Water Agency Act, chapter 1133 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-
21 1.1, et seq.), by the provisions of which CDWA came into existence in January of 1974. CDWA's
22 boundaries are specified in Water Code Appendix section 117-9.1 and encompass approximately
23 120,000 acres, which are located entirely within both the western portion of San Joaquin County
24 and the "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section 12220.

25 While the lands within the agency are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also devoted
26 to numerous other uses including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential,
27 commercial, and institutional uses. CDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to take all
28 reasonable and lawful actions, including to pursue legislative and legal action, that have for their

4
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 6 of 37

1 general purpose either: (1) to protect the water supply of the lands within the agency against

2 intrusion of ocean salinity; and (2) to assure the lands within the agency a dependable supply of

3 water of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and future needs. The agency may also
4  undertake activities to assist landowners and local districts within the agency in reclamation and

5 flood control matters. See Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-4.3, subd. (b) & 117-4.1, subds. (a) and (b),

6 respectively. CDWA may assist landowners, districts, and water right holders within its
7 boundaries in the protection of vested water rights and may represent the interests of those parties

8 in water right proceedings and related proceedings before courts of both the state of California and
9 the United States to carry out the purposes of the agency. See Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-4.2,
10 subd. (b). Operation of the CVP and the State Water Project ("SWP") adversely affect flows,
11 circulation, levels, and quality of water in the channels within the boundaries of the CDWA to the
12 detriment of agricultural and other beneficial water users. By statute, regulation and permit, the
13 | USBR and the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") are supposed to fully mitigate
14 their impacts on such other uses as well as maintain various water quality standards intended to
15 protect the Delta estuary and in-Delta users. The CVP and SWP fail to meet these obligations on a
16 regular basis, and the proposed Project may exacerbate DWR and USBR's continued failure to
17 meet their obligations, resulting in further impaired water flow, circulation, levels, and quality of

18 water.

19 18. Petitioner and Plaintiff SOUTH DELTA WATER AGENCY ("SDWA") is a
20 political subdivision of the State of California created by the California Legislature under the
21 South Delta Water Agency Act, chapter 1089 of the statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-
22 1.1, et seq.), by the provisions of which SDWA came into existence in January of 1974. SDWA's
23 boundaries are specified in Water Code Appendix section 116-9.1 and encompass approximately
24 148,000 acres which are located entirely within both the south-western portion of San Joaquin
25 County and the "Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section
26 12220. While the lands within the agency are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also
27 devoted to numerous other uses including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential,
28 commercial, municipal and institutional uses. SDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to

First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

take all reasonable and lawful actions, including to pursue legislative and legal actions, that have
2 for their general purpose either: (1) to protect the water supply of the lands within the agency
3 against intrusions of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to assure the lands within the agency a dependable

4 supply of water of suitable quality sufficient to meet present and future needs. The agency may

5 also undertake activities to assist landowners and local districts within the agency in reclamation
6 and flood control matters. See Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-4.2, subd. (b) & 116-4.1, subds. (a) and

7 (b), respectively. SDWA may assist landowners, districts, and water right holders within its

8 boundaries in the protection of vested water rights and may represent the interests of those parties
9 in water right proceedings and related proceedings before courts of both the state of California and
10 the United States to carry out the purposes of the agency. See Wat. Code, Appendix, 116-4.2
11 subd. (b). Operation of the CVP and the SWP adversely affect flows, circulation, levels, and
12 quality of water in the channels within the boundaries of the SDWA to the detriment of
13 agricultural and other beneficial water users. By statute, regulation and permit, the USBR and
14 DWR are supposed to fully mitigate their impacts on such other uses as well as maintain various
15 water quality standards intended to protect the Delta estuary and in-Delta users. The CVP and
16 SWP fail to meet these obligations on a regular basis, and the proposed Project may exacerbate
17 DWR and USBR's continued failure to meet their obligations, resulting in further impaired water
18 flow, circulation, levels, and quality of water.

19 19. Respondent and Defendant UNITED STATES BUREAU OF RECLAMATION
20 ("USBR") is subdivision of the Department of the Interior, an agency of the United States of
21 America, and is the Project's lead agency under the NEPA, 28 U.S.C. section 4321 et seq.
22 20. Respondent and Defendant SAN LUIS & DELTA-MENDOTA WATER
23 AUTHORITY ("SLDMWA") is a joint powers agency established under California law, and
24 consists of water agencies representing federal and exchange water service contractors within the
25 western San Joaquin Valley, San Benito and Santa Clara counties in the State of California.
26 SLMDWA is the Project's lead agency under CEQA.

27 21. Defendant David Bernhardt is the Secretary of the United States Department of
28 Interior. Plaintiffs name Secretary Bernhardt in this action in his official capacity, for his actions

6
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 8 of 37

or failures to act in an official capacity, or under color of legal authority. Secretary Bernhardt is
2 responsible for ensuring that the Department of Interior's actions comply with its obligations and

3 with the APA.

22. Defendant UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR is responsible for
5 the administration and implementation of the federal reclamation laws, including the 1902
6 Reclamation Act, as amended, and others, and for projects operating under its authority, including
7 the CVP.

8 23. Defendant UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE is an agency of
9 the United States Department of the Interior. The FWS maintains an office in Sacramento,
10 California, in Sacramento County. The FWS is the agency responsible for authoring the Project's

11 Biological Opinion, dated May 17, 2019, challenged in this action.

12 24. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,
13 coconspirator, partner or alter-ego of those Defendants and Respondents sued herein under the
14 fictitious names of DOES through 100, inclusive, are not known to Plaintiffs, who therefore sue
15 those Defendants and Respondents by such fictitious names. Plaintiffs will ask leave of court to
16 amend this Complaint and insert the true names and capacities of these defendants and
17 respondents when the same have been ascertained. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that
18 basis allege, that each of the Defendants and Respondents designated herein as a DOE defendant
19 and respondent is legally responsible in some manner for the events and happenings alleged in this
20 Complaint, and that Plaintiffs' alleged injuries were proximately caused by the defendants'
21 conduct.
22 V. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

23 25. In late 2010 and early 2011, USBR published a Notice of Intent in the Federal
24 Register and a Notice of Preparation in the California State Clearinghouse for a "Long-Term
25 Water Transfers" project that would cover ten years of transfers. USBR and SLDMWA released a
26 Draft EIS/EIR for public and agency review and comment in 2014, and a Final EIS/EIR was
27 released in 2015. SLDMWA later approved the Project, certified the EIR, and filed a Notice of
28 Determination, while USBR signed its Record of Decision that same year.

7
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 9 of 37

1 26. The so-called "Long-Term Water Transfers" project was a ten-year programmatic
2 analysis of water transfers from willing sellers to Central Valley Project contractors south and
3 west of the Delta. The original "Long-Term Water Transfers" would have been a destructive force

4 on groundwater dependent communities and farms, streams, species, and habitat in the
5 Sacramento Valley and the Delta's wildlife, water quality and legal-water users.

6 27. Plaintiffs, along with other parties, challenged the "Long-term Water Transfers" in
7 United States District Court for the Eastern District of California in the case AquAlliance, et al., v.
8  U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, et al. 287 F.Supp.3d 969 (E.D. Cal. 2018) (AquAlliance).

9 28. On February 15, 2018, the District Court issued its Memorandum Decision and
10 Order, finding for Plaintiffs on several core issues and some of the most significant impacts of the
11 "Long-term Water Transfers" program and project. The District Court found violations of NEPA,
12 CEQA and the Endangered Species Act with respect to inadequate analysis of biological impacts
13 due to reduced delta outflow, improperly deferred mitigation for groundwater impacts, failure to
14 adequately analyze the effectiveness of mitigation measures for groundwater impacts, inadequate
15 mitigation for land subsidence, inadequate analysis of changed hydrologic conditions resulting
16 from climate change, and inadequate analysis and mitigation for impacts to giant garter snake.
17 29. Rather than accept that the Court had indeed invalidated demonstrably flawed
18 documents, the Defendants fought to avoid vacatur and decertification of the 2015 EIS/EIR and
19 the Biological Opinion ("BiOp"). This forced the Court to ask for supplemental briefing and
20 subsequently make clear to the unwilling Defendants that it was necessary to vacate both
21 documents in their entirety, due to the severity and pervasiveness of the violations.

22 30. On July 5, 2018, the District Court entered judgment, vacating SLDMWA's and
23 USBR's decisions to approve the Final Long-Term Water Transfers EIS/EIR and approve the
24 Proposed Action, vacating the 2015 EIS/EIR, and vacating the BiOp.

25 31. In February of 2019, USBR and SLDMWA released a Draft Revised EIS/EIR for
26| public comment for the Project, which purported to only cover water transfers for 2019-2024. The
27 Project is held out by USBR and SLDMWA as merely a modified, shortened version of the
28| "Long-term Water Transfers" program that was previously vacated. However, numerous changes

8
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-CV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 10 of 37

to the Project, including new sellers, the shortened time-frame, and unenforceable limits on
2 transfers combine to render the Project a distinct endeavor from the "Long-Term Water

3 Transfers."

4 32. Plaintiffs, wary of USBR and SLDMWA's attempt to engage in as little

5 environmental review as possible while purporting to comply with the District Court's ruling in
6 AquAlliance, supra, 287 F.Supp.3d. 969, commented extensively on the Draft

7 Supplemental/Revised EIS/EIR and the Final Supplemental/Revised EIS/EIR.

8 33. The EIS/EIR is nothing more than USBR and SLDMWA's failed attempt to update

9 the 2015 FEIS/EIR document, in piecemeal fashion, in response to the Court's ruling in
10 AquAlliance, supra, 287 F.Supp.3d. 969. Not only have USBR and SLDMWA not made changes
11 to rectify the flaws detailed in the District Court's ruling, they have created a EIS/EIR that is
12 confusing and unusable as an informational document.

13 34. USBR and SLDMWA have failed to provide an accurate project description as
14 required under both NEPA and CEQA. The most glaring example of the many flaws in the

15 Project description is the inclusion of two unenforceable assurances: that transfers in any one year
16 would not exceed 250,000 acre-feet; and that transfers would only occur in two years out of the

17 Project's 2019-2024 period. These assurances are not actual elements of the Project as they are
18  unenforceable. There is no mitigation measure, coordinated operations agreement, or any other
19 enforcement mechanism to this effect. The EIS/EIR also makes the critical error of relying on the

20 same baseline as the 2015 EIS/EIR, despite significant changed circumstances and new
21 linformation.

22 35. Most troubling of all is that the Project, despite having six-year as opposed to a
23 ten-year time frame, would still pose a considerable threat to groundwater dependent communities
24 and farms, streams, species, and habitat in the Sacramento Valley and the Delta, wildlife, water
25 quality, and in-Delta water users. USBR and SLDMWA do not take these significant risks
26 seriously, as reflected in the EIS/EIR's analysis of the Project's impacts.

27 36. The Project's water transfers would be facilitated by groundwater substitution,
28 reservoir releases, cropland idling, crop shifting, and conservation. These methods each carry

9
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al,

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 11 of 37

- their own impacts on the environment, while exacerbating impacts from other sources such as
2 global climate change.

3 37.

4 Groundwater substitution impacts groundwater, risking basin overdraft, stream

5 depletion and cones of depression. Cones of depression are not isolated to single points, but cause
region-wide impacts across zones of influence. Stream depletion occurs when lowered
6 groundwater levels cause increased seepage from streams. These effects from excess groundwater
7 pumping cause impacts to agriculture operations, the availability of groundwater for other users,
8 and biological impacts to species that rely on the depleted streams as habitat as well as terrestrial

9 habitat.

10 38. Significant impacts to groundwater would conflict with local agencies' compliance
11 with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act and the Public Trust Doctrine.

12 39. The Project would impact groundwater basins, such as the Sacramento Valley
13 Groundwater Basin that is already in decline with all but one of the Project's subbasins rated as
14 high or medium priority under SGMA. The Project will exacerbate existing conditions, and impair
15 existing domestic and agricultural wells.

16 40. Moreover, the Project will exacerbate the impacts of global climate change on
17 groundwater resources. As climate change limits the availability of surface water, groundwater

18 will be increasingly relied on, further threatening existing groundwater levels. The Project would
19 compound those impacts through groundwater substitutions for surface water sold.

20 41.

21 Drastic enough groundwater depletion creates the risk of ground subsidence, which
is already occurring in the seller service areas.

22 42. Stream depletion leads to impacts to deep-rooted vegetation. Loss of vegetation in
23 conjunction with stream depletion leads to higher water temperatures and increased
24 evapotranspiration, further lowering surface water levels. These impacts compound one another
25 and would devastate wildlife inhabit those streams.

26 43. Crop idling and shifting destroys habitat for endangered species such as the giant
27 garter snake. The giant garter snake relies on active rice fields and the supporting water
28 conveyance infrastructure as alternative habitat in the absence of suitable natural marsh. The

10
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

|Case 2:20-CV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 12 of 37

Project could result in the elimination of 12 percent of the active rice fields by crop idling and
2 shifting, directly affecting giant garter snake habitat.

3 44. The Project's mitigation for impacts to giant garter snakes is inadequate and flies in

4 the face of well-established science. The Project would only protect the water conveyance
5 infrastructure associated with rice fields, the canals, levees, and ditches that giant garter snake use

6 for intermittent period while travelling between more established habitat. Protecting only the
7 conveyance features, and not the actual rice fields, jeopardizes giant garter snake populations.
8 Rice fields are unquestionably important habitat resource for giant garter snakes.

9 45. Limiting giant garter snake habitat would lead to increased dispersal, predation, and
10 reduced reproduction leading to population-level effects.

11 46. Much like groundwater impacts, the Project would also exacerbate the effects of
12 global climate change on giant garter snakes. Destruction of habitat and reduced streamflow
13 caused by global climate change would be magnified by the Project's water transfer methods.
14 Further, increased temperatures put additional stress on ectothermic animals such as the giant
15 garter snake that must constantly regulate body temperatures within narrow ranges.

16 47. The full extent of the Project's impacts on these environmental resources, however,
17 cannot be known as USBR and SLDMWA have failed to incorporate new information and
18 changed circumstances into their analysis of the Project. Further, the EIS/EIR relies on outdated
19 studies and methodologies to analyze and mitigate impacts.

20 48. The EIS/EIR expressly relies on the 2019 BiOp, which purports to evaluate the
21 effects of the Project on GGS. However, the 2019 BiOps evaluates an agency action that is not
22 coextensive with the Project here by assuming, without justification, that water transfers would
23 only occur during two of the remaining Project years. The BiOp also arbitrarily ignores the
24 | importance of rice fields to GGS habitat by focusing conservation measures on ditches and canals.
25 Finally, the BiOp analyzes an impermissibly narrow scope of cumulative projects that may
26 contribute to jeopardy of the GGS.

1 VI. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

2 Administrative Procedure Act

3 49. The APA confers a right of judicial review on any person that is adversely affected
4 by agency action. See 5. U.S.C. § 702. §

5 50. The APA provides that the reviewing court "shall . .. hold unlawful and set aside
6 agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be [] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

7 discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law," as well as findings that are "unsupported by

8 substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (E). Claimed violations of both NEPA and the
CPVIA are reviewed under the APA.

10 National Environmental Policy Act

11 51. The Project is subject to the environmental review process of NEPA, 42 U.S.C. §
12 4321. NEPA requires the Federal government to use all practicable means to improve and
13 coordinate federal activities to create and maintain conditions in which people and nature can exist
14 in "productive harmony." 42 U.S.C. § 4331. NEPA is an environmental full-disclosure law so
15 that federal agencies must consider all environmental consequences of their decisions.

16 52. "NEPA ... makes environmental protection a part of the mandate of every federal
17 agency and department," Calvert Cliffs' Coord. Com. v. United States, 440 F.2d 1109, 112 (D.C.
18 Cir. 1971), and is the "basic national charter for protection of the environment." 40 C.F.R. §
19 1500.1(a). Its purpose is "to help public officials make decisions that are based on understanding
20 of environmental consequences, and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the
21 Il environment.» Id. § 1500.1(c). The Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ"), an agency
22 within the Executive Office of the President, has promulgated regulations implementing NEPA.
23 See 10 C.F.R. § 1021.103.

24 53. Among other things, NEPA requires all agencies of the federal government to
25 prepare a "detailed statement" that discusses the environmental effects of, and reasonable
26 alternatives to, all "major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
27 environment." 42 § U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). This statement is commonly known as an environmental
28 impact statement ("EIS"). An EIS must describe: (1) the "environmental impact of the proposed

12
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 14 of 37

1 action"; (2) any "adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be
2 implemented"; and (3) any "alternatives to the proposed action." Id. The environmental "effects"
3 that must be considered in an EIS include "indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are

4 later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable." 40 C.F.R.
5 1508.8(b).

6 California Environmental Quality Act

7 54. CEQA has two purposes: environmental protection and informed self-government.
8 Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. V. City of Fresno, 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 690-691 (2007).
9 CEQA is "to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the
10 reasonable scope of the statutory language." Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com., 16

11 Cal.4th 105, 134 (1997). CEQA requires agencies to "take all action necessary to protect,
12 rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." Pub. Resources Code, §
13 21001(a).

14 55. Pursuant to CEQA, a "project" is an activity which may cause either direct physical

15 change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment

16 (Pub. Resources Code § 21065(a)); and a "discretionary" project is one that is subject to
17 judgmental controls, where the agency can use its judgment to decide whether and how to carry

18 out a project. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA Guidelines"), 15002(i). Prior to

19 approving any discretionary project, an agency must fully disclose and analyze all of the project's

20 potentially significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. See, e.g., CEQA

21 Guidelines § 15002(f)), and that public agencies avoid or minimize such environmental damage
22 where feasible. CEQA Guidelines § 15021(a). Pursuant to this duty, no public agency may
23 approve or carry out a project where one or more significant effects on the environment may

24 occur if the project is approved, unless certain narrow findings are made. CEQA Guidelines §§

25 15091, 15093.

26 Public Trust Doctrine

27 56. In California, pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, governmental entities and
28 agencies are required to consider and prioritize public trust uses including navigation, protection

13
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 15 of 37

- of fisheries, recreation, and preservation of trust lands in their natural state. Marks v.

2 Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259-260. These duties apply not only to state agencies but also to
3 regional and local governmental entities. See, Zack's, Inc. V. City of Sausalito (2008) 165

4 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1180; Center for Biological Diversity, Inc. V. FPL Group, Inc. (2008) 166
5 Cal.App.4th 1349, 1370. Indeed, "[a]ny action which will adversely affect traditional public rights

6 in trust lands is a matter of general public interest and should therefore be made only if there has
7 been full consideration of the state's public interest in the matter." San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc.
8 v. California State Lands Comm._(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 202, 234 (emphasis added); Envtl. Law
9 Foundation v. State Water Resources Control Bd., (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 844.

10 Endangered Species Act

11 57. The ESA prohibits federal agencies from taking actions that are "likely to
12 jeopardize the continued existence" or "result in the destruction or adverse modification of
13 [critical] habitat[s]" of endangered or threatened species without the issuance of an Incidental
14| Take Permit ("ITP"). 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2).

15 58. Where a proposed action "may" adversely affect a species or its habitat, ESA
engage in formal consultation with either FWS 16 Section 7(a)(2) compels federal action agencies to
17 or NMFS, depending on the species, to determine the likely effects of their proposed actions on
18 endangered or threatened species and their critical habitats. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); 50 C.F.R. §
19 402.14(a).

20 59. A formal consultation results in the preparation of a BiOp by either the FWS or
21 NMFS, depending on the species. A BiOp details whether the proposed action, "taken together
22 with cumulative effects, is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in
23 the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat." 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(g)(4).

24 60. The BiOp must be based on "the best scientific and commercial data available or
25 which can be obtained during the consultation for an adequate review of the effects that an action
26 may have upon listed species or critical habitat." 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2); 50 C.F.R. § 402.14(d).
27 61. If the BiOp concludes that jeopardy is not likely and that there will not be an
28 adverse modification of critical habitat, or that there is a "reasonable and prudent alternative" to

14
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-CV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 16 of 37

the agency action that avoids jeopardy and adverse modification and that the incidental taking of
2 endangered or threatened species will not violate section 7(a)(2), the consulting agency can issue

3 an ITS which, if followed, exempts the action agency from the prohibition on takings found in

4 9 Section 9 of the ESA. The ITS must authorize and anticipate any incidental take that may result

5 from the proposed project and explain how such take will not jeopardize the continued existence
6 of the endangered or threatened species. The ITS must: (1) specify the impact of the incidental
7 taking on the species; (2) specify the "reasonable and prudent measures" that the FWS considers

8 necessary or appropriate to minimize such impact; (3) set forth "terms and conditions" with which

9 the action agency must comply to implement the reasonable and prudent measures (including, but
10 not limited to, reporting requirements); and (4) specify the procedures to be used to handle or

11 dispose of any animals actually taken. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4); 50 C.F.R. § 402:14(i).

12 62. The ESA requires that a BiOp detail the effects of the "agency action" on listed
13 species and/or critical habitat. 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(3)(A). The ESA "prohibits agencies from
14 segmenting a single agency action into separate parts for consultation." Nat'l Wildlife Fedn v. Nat'l
15 Marine Fisheries Serv., No. C02-2259L, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32494, at *32 (W.D. Wash. Nov.
16 1, 2004). Further, the ESA "requires the biological opinion to analyze the effect of the entire
17 agency action." Conner v. Burford, 848 F.2d 1441, 1435 (9th Cir. 1988) (citing North Slope
18 Borough v. Andrus, 642 F.2d 589, 608 (D.C. Cir. 1980), affg in part, rev'g in part, 486 F. Supp.
19 332 (D.D.C. 1980)) (emphasis added). The term "agency action" is interpreted broadly as "caution

20 can only be exercised if the agency takes a look at all the possible ramifications of the agency
21 action." Id. (quoting North Slope, 642 F.2d 589, 608). Moreover, the ESA does not permit an
22 "incremental-step approach" to consultation. Id. at 1458. Instead, "biological opinions must be
23 coextensive with the agency action." Id.

24 VII. STANDING

25 63. Members of AquAlliance, CSPA, and C-WIN reside in the Bay-Delta, the
26 Sacramento River valley, and the San Joaquin River valley. AquAlliance's members rely on
27 groundwater, rivers, and streams for their homes, businesses, recreation, to irrigate crops, and to
28 participate in the economy of the region. AquAlliance's members play an active role in water

15
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 17 of 37

1 education, planning, policy, and protection. CSPA and its members actively participate in water
2 rights and water quality processes, engage in education and organization of the fishing
3 community, conduct restoration efforts, and vigorously enforce environmental laws enacted to
4 protect fisheries, wildlife, habitat and water quality. AquAlliance's, CSPA's, and C-WIN's

5 members reside and own property throughout California as well as in those areas served by the

6 Central Valley and State Water Projects, and use the waters, including groundwater, affected by
7 the USBR and SLMWDA Project, for gardening, landscaping, and growing crops. As water
8 contractors begin pumping additional groundwater in order to replace the CVP, SWP, and Yuba
9 River water they transfer, the Project risks degrading or lowering the groundwater in areas where
10 Plaintiffs' members operate wells or otherwise rely on groundwater to maintain their properties.
11 64. Members of AquAlliance, CSPA, and C-WIN use the Bay-Delta, the Sacramento
12 River and its tributaries, and the San Joaquin River and its tributaries to fish, sail, boat, kayak,
13 swim, birdwatch, hike, view wildlife and engage in scientific study, including monitoring
14 activities. AquAlliance's, CSPA's, and C-WIN's members have enjoyed fishing for salmon and
15 other fish in the Delta, San Francisco Bay, and the Sacramento River watershed, whose numbers
16 and vitality depend on an intact and healthy ecosystem in the Delta, San Francisco Bay, and the
17 Sacramento River watershed. Where elements of that ecosystem are reduced or eliminated,
18 AquAlliance's, CSPA's, and C-WIN's members' recreational uses and aesthetic enjoyment of
19 those areas are reduced by their awareness of the waterway and habitat degradation. As the
20 degradation of the rivers, their tributaries, and the Delta's ecosystem is further exacerbated,
21 Plaintiffs members' catch fewer fish, and observe fewer wildlife. The catching and killing of
22 Delta smelt and the drastic reductions in their population numbers substantially alter the ecological
23 balance in the Delta and San Francisco Bay and reduce Plaintiffs' members' aesthetic enjoyment
24 of these areas as they are boating and fishing.

25 65. CDWA and SDWA constituent land owners, water rights holders and beneficial
26 water users are located in the Delta and rely on surface water and groundwater for their homes,
27 businesses, recreation, to irrigate crops, and to participate in the economy of the region. These
28 landowners, water rights holders and beneficial water users use the waters, including groundwater,

16
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-CV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 18 of 37

1 affected by the USBR and SLMWDA Project, for agriculture, recreation, wildlife habitat, open

2 space as well as residential, commercial, municipal and institutional uses. The Project impairs

3 these beneficial uses of water by negatively impacting water quantities, levels, quality, and

4 circulation, among other impacts. The Project's impacts on biological resources, including
5 impacts to protected species, also impairs these Plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of the Delta region

6 for recreational and other uses.

7 66. Thus, the interests of Plaintiffs' members, landowners and water rights holders
8 have been, are being, and will continue to be adversely affected by USBR and SLDMWA's failure
9 to comply with NEPA and CEQA and the likely dramatic impacts to groundwaters, surface
10 waters, and associated species, ecosystems, and human uses. The relief sought herein will redress

11 the harms to Plaintiffs and their members, landowners and water rights holders caused by
12 Defendants' failure to comply with CEQA and NEPA.

13 67. AquAlliance, CSPA, C-WIN, CDWA, and SDWA, their members, officers,
14 landowners and water rights holders are deeply concerned about the adverse consequences of the
15| USBR and SLDMWA continuation of water transfers, year after year, with inadequate
16 environmental review of the adverse direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the continuing
17 transfers approved and facilitated by the state and federal governments. These proposed transfers
18 will require the use of additional groundwater, increase depletion of Sacramento Valley
19 groundwater basins and streams, residential and agricultural wells, and have potentially
20 catastrophic impacts on the endangered species, including but not limited to Delta smelt, winter-
21 run and spring-run salmon, giant garter snake, and the yellow-billed cuckoo. Plaintiffs' members,
22 landowners and water rights holders will be injured by the additional water diverted from
23 groundwater basins and resulting stream impacts without adequate environmental analysis.
24 Consequently, Plaintiffs and their members, landowners and water rights holders would be
25 directly, adversely, and irreparably harmed by the project and its components, as described herein,
26 until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this complaint.
27 68. Failure by USBR, FWS and SLDMWA to ensure that the Project does not impact
28 listed species and their habitats harms Plaintiffs' members', officers', landowners', and water

17
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-Cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 19 of 37

rights holders' interests in the species. Unless the requested relief is granted, Plaintiffs' interests
2 will continue to be injured. The injuries described above are actual, concrete injuries that will

3 occur unless relief is granted by this Court. The relief sought herein, USBR and SLDMWA's
4 compliance with CEQA and NEPA, and FWS' compliance with the ESA, would redress Plaintiffs'
5 injuries. Plaintiffs have no other adequate remedy at law, and they bring this action on behalf of

6 their adversely affected members.
7 VIII. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

8 69. Plaintiffs have performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in
9 the administrative process. Plaintiffs actively participated in the administrative process by
10 submitting comments, along with other public agencies, organizations, and members of the public,
11 outlining the claims contained herein. As such, Plaintiffs have fully exhausted their administrative
12 remedies, to the extent such remedies exist and to the extent that exhaustion of administrative
13 remedies is legally necessary.
14 70. Plaintiffs possess no other remedy to challenge Defendants' abuses of discretion
15 and failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
16 IX. NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

17 71. Plaintiffs have complied with California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
18 providing written notice of commencement of this action to defendant SLDMWA prior to filing
19 this Complaint. A true and correct copy of the notice provided pursuant thereto, with proof of
20 service thereof, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

21 X. ELECTION TO PREPARE RECORD

22 72. Petitioners elect to prepare the CEQA administrative record in this proceeding
23 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2). Petitioners' election is attached hereto
24 as Exhibit B.

25 XI. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

26 73. Petitioners and Plaintiffs bring this action as a private attorneys general pursuant to
27 California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to
28 enforce important rights affecting the public interest.

18
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 20 of 37

1 74. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition and Complaint will confer
2 significant benefits on the general public by, among other benefits: (1) requiring SLDMWA to
3 properly disclose, analyze and mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Projects

4 that were not properly disclosed, analyzed or mitigated, (2) ensuring that SLDMWA properly
5 considers mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the Projects' potentially significant, adverse
6 environmental effects, (3) requiring SLDMWA to implement all feasible alternatives and
7 mitigation measures to avoid such adverse effects or reduce them to less-than-significant levels,

8 and (4) ensuring that SLDMWA affords the public and affected agencies with the opportunity to
9 review and comment on potentially significant Project impacts, and receiving a meaningful and
10 complete response to any such comments on such issues, prior to the approval of such projects.
11 75. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the enforcement of
12 important rights affecting the public interest. By compelling SLDMWA to complete a legally
13 adequate analysis of the Projects, to protect public and natural resources, SLDMWA will be
14 required to properly and publicly disclose and analyze all of the Projects' potentially significant,
15 adverse environmental effects, and to ensure that all feasible mitigation measures or alternatives
16 that would reduce or avoid the Project's potentially significant, adverse environmental impacts are
17 implemented.

18 76. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
19 attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioners and Plaintiffs,
20 the Project might otherwise be deemed valid despite its legally and factually inadequate
21 disclosures, analysis, conclusions, mitigation measures, and alternatives, among other things, and,
22 as a result, potentially significant, adverse environmental effects might otberwise have evaded
23 legally adequate environmental review and mitigation in accordance with the California
24 Legislature's policy, in adopting CEQA, of affording the greatest protections to the environment
25 within the scope of the statute.

26 INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

27 77. Injunctive relief is necessary to prevent Defendants from continuing to engage in
28 the unlawful practices alleged herein. Defendants and persons acting in concert therewith have

•19
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-Cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 21 of 37

1 done, are now doing, and will continue to do or cause to be done, the above-described illegal acts
2 unless restrained or enjoined by this Court. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy
3 at law, in that pecuniary compensation alone would not afford adequate and complete relief.
4 Unless Defendants are restrained from committing further illegal acts, their above-described acts

5 will cause great and irreparable damage to Plaintiffs.

6 78. An actual controversy now exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants concerning
7 their rights, privileges, and obligations in that Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' above-
8 mentioned actions have violated and will continue to violate their rights under federal and state
9 law and Defendants contend in all respects to the contrary.

10 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

11 VIOLATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT

12 (By Plaintiffs against USBR and Does 1 through 200)

13 79. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
14 Paragraphs 1 through 78 as though fully set forth herein.

15 80. The USBR has failed to prepare an EIS that complies with NEPA and satisfies its
16 duty to provide good faith public disclosure of the Project's impacts. These deficiencies include,
17 without limitation, the following:

18 The EIS/EIR Relies on an Unstable Project Description

19 81. Per USBR's own NEPA regulations, an EIS must include a description of the
20 proposed action. 43 C.F.R. § 46.415, subd. (a)(2); see also 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14, subd. (b) [an EIS
21 must "[d]evote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail including the proposed
22 action .. .".

23 82. The EIS/EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the
24 proposed Project are missing, provided details are contradictory, and the EIR/EIS makes
25 assurances regarding Project operations without any enforcement mechanism.

26 83. The EIS/EIR describes the Project as restricting transfers to 250,000 acre feet per
27 year, yet no legally enforceable element of the Project would enforce the purported annual
28 restriction.

20
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-CV-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 22 of 37

F 84. The EIS/EIR describes the Project as only including transfers for two years
2 between 2019-2024, yet no legally enforcement element of the Project would restrict transfers to
3 only two years of the 2019-2024 period.

4 85. The EIS/EIR's project description is also deficient because it is inconsistent with
5 the impact analysis. The EIS/EIR continues to analyze the impacts of the 2015-2024 water
6 transfer project while describing a 2019-2024 water transfer project.

7 86. The Project now includes additional sellers that are not reflected in the EIS/EIR's

8 project description.

9 The EIS/EIR Reflects Piecemealed Review of the Underlying Project

10 87. The Project's EIS/EIR is the result of impermissible project piecemealing by the
11 USBR in violation of NEPA. CEQ regulations section 1502.4(a) states that "[p]roposals or parts
12 of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be, in effect, a single course of
13 action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement." CEQ regulations section 1508.25(a)(1),
14 meanwhile, directs agencies to study "connected actions" in "the same impact statement," and sets
15 forth criteria for determining whether actions are "connected."

16 88. The EIS/EIR also impermissibly piecemeals review of the Project because the
17 Project is merely a segment of the Sacramento Valley Water Management Agreement, the
18 Environmental Water Account, and the Yuba Accord that USBR sought and still seeks to
19 | implement.

20 Failure to Provide Sufficient Information to Generate Meaningful Comment

21 89. A lead agency violates NEPA by "failing to provide the public with "sufficient
22 information to ... generate meaningful comment?" Sierra Club v. Flowers, 423 F.Supp.2d 1273,
23 1329 (S.D. Fla. 2006) quoting 33 C.F.R. § 325.3(a); 40 C.F.R. §§ 15001.(b), 1500.2, 1506.6.

24 90. Here, the EIS/EIR is disorganized, relevant information is inaccessible, and the
25 analysis is incomplete.

26 Inadequate Analysis of Project Alternatives

27 91. NEPA requires an EIS to discuss, among other things, alternatives to the proposed
28 action. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C). NEPA's implementing regulations describe the analysis of

21
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 23 of 37

P alternatives as "the heart of the environmental impact statement." CEQ regulations, § 1502.14.

2 The range of alternatives that an EIS must consider is "dictated by the nature and scope of the
3 proposed action." Friends of Yosemite Valley v. Kempthorne, 520 F.3d 1024, 1038 (9th Cir.
4 2008). Yet agencies may not define the project's purpose and need in terms SO "unreasonably

5 narrow," that only one alternative would accomplish the goals of the project. Nat'l Parks &
6 Conservation Ass'n v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 606 F.3d 1058, 1070 (9th Cir. 2010).

7 92. The EIS/EIR's analysis of alternatives fails to comply with NEPA because it failed
8 to consider a reasonable range of alternatives, in light of the changed circumstances, new
9 information, and changes to the Project; instead, continuing to rely on the alternatives included in
10 the invalidated 2015 EIS/EIR.

11 Inadequate Analysis of Baseline Conditions and Project Impacts

12 93. Under NEPA, Courts "review agency decisions to ensure that "the agency has taken

13 a "hard look" at the potential environmental consequences of the proposed action." Nw. Envtl.
14 Advocates v. NMFS, 460 F.3d 1125, 1133 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands
15 Ctr., 387 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. Or. 2004)). Further, NEPA requires that the agency provide the
16 data on which it bases its environmental analysis. See Lands Council, 537 F.3d at 994 (holding
17 that an agency must support its conclusions with studies that the agency deems reliable.

18 94. Additionally, an agency must supplement an EIS where there are significant new
19 circumstances or information relevant to a project's environmental concerns. 40 C.F.R. 1502.9,
20 subd. (c)(ii); see also Russell Country Sportsmen v. United States Forest Serv., 668 F.3d 1037,
21 1045 (9th Cir. 2011). Failure to account for such changes renders an EIS's impact analysis legally
22 deficient. See N.M. ex rel. Richardson v. BLM, 565 F.3d 683, 715 (10th Cir. 2009).

23 95. Here, the EIS/EIR does not contain sufficient information to support its conclusion
24 for many resource areas including, but not limited to:

25 a. Vegetation and Wildlife;

26 b. Climate Change;

27 C. Groundwater;

28 d. Water Supply;

9 Defective Scope of Cumulative Projects
NEPA regulations require USBR to consider cumulative effects which "result[]

11 from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably
10 foreseeable future actions" with the goal of making sure that "individually minor but collectively
significant" actions are properly analyzed. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7; see also Kern v. BLM, 284 F.3d
12 1062, 1078 (9th Cir. 2002) (purpose is to avoid "the

14 other projects. tyranny of small decisions"). Here, however,
13 the EIS/EIR failed to consider the effects of the Project combined with the implementation of

15 97. The EIS/EIR fails to include probable future projects in its cumulative impact
16 analysis, including the Addendum to the Coordinated Operation Agreements of the Central Valley
17 Project and the State Water Project, the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
18 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary Amendments and Voluntary Settlement Agreements, ,
19 the Sites Reservoir project, other water transfers, the California Department of Water Resources'

21 20 Delta Conveyance Project, and amendments to State Water Project water supply contracts.

22 98.

23 Inadequate Mitigation
NEPA's implementing regulations require agencies to discuss potential mitigation
measures in their EISs and decision documents. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14(f), 1502.16(e)-(h),
24  1505.2(c), 1508.25(b)(3); see also Id. § 1508.20 (defining "mitigation"). Mitigation must "be
25 discussed in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly
26 evaluated." Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. at 353. Such discussion necessarily

28 27 includes "an assessment of whether the proposed mitigation measures can be effective." S. Fork

2 Band Council of W. Shoshone of Nev. v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 588 F.3d 718, 727 (9th Cir. 2009).
The EIS/EIR's analysis of proposed mitigation is defective under this standard.

3 99.

4 The EIS/EIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures,
and what mitigation measures that are included in the EIS/EIR's are unenforceable or insufficient.

5 100.

6 The EIS/EIR's inadequate mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:

a. Mitigation for tree loss;

7 b. Mitigation for streamflow loss;

8 C. Mitigation for groundwater depletion and subsidence;
9 d. Mitigation for third-party water supply impacts;

10 e. Mitigation for impacts to Giant Garter Snakes.

11

12 101. Additionally, the EIS/EIR describes the Project as having a 250,000 acre feet per

13 year transfer limit, and claims that transfers would only occur in two years of the 2019-2024

14 Project. These restrictions are de facto mitigation measures, and as such they must be defined
with specificity and be legally enforceable.

15 102. The USBR's actions in failing to comply with NEPA are arbitrary, capricious, and
16 abuse of discretion and contrary to law in violation of the APA.

19 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA

20 (By Petitioners and Plaintiffs against SLDMWA)
21 103. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
22 Paragraphs 1 through 102 as though fully set forth herein.

23 104. The SLDMWA prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIS/EIR. The
24 SLDMWA did not proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the
25 Project and certifying the EIS/EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. Pub. Resources
26 Code 21168.5; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova, 40
27 Cal.4th 412, 426 (Cal. 2007). These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:
28 The Project Description is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-Cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 26 of 37

- 105. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the
2 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. San Joaquin
3 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655 (2007) (SJ Raptor). An
4 EIR should a contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information
5 which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
6 consequences." CEQA Guidelines $ 15151. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is
7 the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR.' County of Inyo V. City of Los
8 Angeles, 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 193 (1977). "Only through an accurate view of the project may

9 affected outsiders and public decision makers balance the proposal's benefit against its
10 environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the
11 proposal . and weigh other alternatives in the balance." Id. at 192-93. A project description may
12 not provide conflicting signals to decision makers and the public about the nature and scope of the
13 project as such a description is fundamentally inadequate and misleading. S.J Raptor, supra, 149
14 Cal. App. 4th at 655-656.

15 106. The EIS/EIR's project description is deficient because numerous details of the
16 proposed Project are missing, provided details are contradictory, and the EIR/EIS makes
17 assurances regarding Project operations without any enforcement mechanism.

18 107.

19 The EIS/EIR describes the Project as restricting transfers to 250,000 acre feet per
year, yet no legally enforceable element of the Project would enforce the purported annual
20  restriction.

21 108. The EIS/EIR describes the Project as only including transfers for two of the 2019-
22 2024 years, yet no legally enforcement element of the Project would restrict transfers to only two
23 years of the 2019-2024 transfer period.

24 109. SLDMWA states, in its responses to comments on the Final EIS/EIR, that the
25 project will only include single year transfers, while the Final EIS/EIR states that multi-year

26 transfers are covered.

Case 2:20-Cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 27 of 37

1 110. The EIS/EIR's project description is also deficient because it is inconsistent with
2 the impact analysis. Much of the EIS/EIR continues to analyze the impacts of the 2015-2024

3 water transfer project while describing a 2019-2024 water transfer project.

4 111. The Project now includes additional sellers that are not reflected in the EIS/EIR's
5 project description.

6 The EIS/EIR is Inadequate as an Informational Document

7 112. The information in an EIR must not only be sufficient in quantity, but it must be
8 presented a clear manner so as to adequately inform the public and decision makers. "A reader of
9 the FEIR could not reasonably be expected to ferret out an unreferenced discussion . . .. interpret
10 that discussion's unexplained figures without assistance, and spontaneously incorporate them into
11 the FEIR's own discussion of total projected supply and demand." Vineyard Area Citizens for
12 Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal.4th 412, 442 (2007). Information
13 scattered throughout an EIR and its appendices and supporting reports are not substitutes for good
14 faith reasoned analysis. Ibid. An EIR should be written in a way that readers are not forced "to
15 sift through" to find important components of the analysis. San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr. v.
16 County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 659. Accordingly, an EIR is usually prepared as a
17 stand-alone document. CEQA provides that EIRs should be prepared in a "standard format" when
18| feasible. Pub. Resources Code §8 21100(a), 21061; CFQA Guidelines, § 15122. It is
19 inappropriate, however, to use a group of documents collected together to serve the function of an
20 EIR, as SLDMWA appears to be attempting here. See Russian Hill Improvement Ass'n v. Board of

21 Permit Appeals (1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 158. The incomplete presentation of information is a failure
22 to proceed in a manner required by law. Vineyard Area Citizens, supra; Banning Ranch
23 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach, 2 Cal.5th 918, 935 (2017).

24 113. Here, the EIS/EIR is disorganized, relevant information is inaccessible, and the
25 analysis is incomplete.

26 The EIS/EIR Fails to Analyze Related Regulatory Regimes

27 114. Under CEQA, lead agencies must consider related regulatory regimes in its
28 analysis of a project, particularly in the context of analyzing project alternatives. Banning Ranch

First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 28 of 37

1 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach, 2 Cal.5th 918, 936-937 (2017). Failure to include such
2 analysis of related regulatory requirements is an informational deficiency and failure to proceed in
3 the manner required by law. Id. at 941-942.

4 115. The EIS/EIR fails to disclose other related regulatory regimes or analyze how such
5 regimes could impact the Project.

6 116. One example includes the EIS/EIR's failure to include any information regarding
7 the Delta Reform Act (Wat. Code, §§ 85000 et seq.) or the Delta Stewardship Council's
8 permitting authority over the Project as a covered action pursuant to the Delta Plan.

9 117. In addition, the EIS/EIR fails to consider procedural and substantive requirements
10 of the Public Trust Doctrine as afforded to wildlife, water of the state, and ecosystems, for the
11 benefit of the People of the State.

12 118. Additionally, the EIS/EIR fails to consider inconsistencies with California's
13 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.

14 The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

15 119. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
16 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical environmental
17 conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is
18 published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." CEQA Guidelines 15125. The
19 description of the project's baseline ensures that the public has "an understanding of the
20 significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a).
21 Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions is crucial to accurately evaluating a
22 project's impact. E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus, 27
23 Cal.App.4th 713 (1994).

24 120. The EIS/EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and
25 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIS/EIR's environmental analysis. The
26 flaws include, but are not limited to:

27 a. Failure to describe baseline groundwater, surface water, water supply,
28 climate, habitat, and subsidence conditions of sellers' service areas;

27
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-Cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 29 of 37

b. Impermissibly relying on severely outdated baseline information from the
2 2015 EIS/EIR to evaluate Project impacts.

3 The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts

4 121. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant
5 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. Pub. Resources
6 Code § 21100(b), CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a).

7 122. The EIR/EIS's impact analysis is inadequate in part because it fails to account for
8 new information that has become available since the original environmental review of the 2015-
9 2024 transfers project. "If the proposed changes render the previous environmental document
10 wholly irrelevant to the decision-making process, then it is only logical that the agency start from
11 the beginning under [Public Resources Code] section 21151 by conducting an initial study to
12 determine whether the project may have substantial effects on the environment." Friends of
13 College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. 1 Cal.5th 937, 951
14 (2006). The question a under CEQA is "when there is a change in plans, circumstances, or available
15 information after a project has received initial approval, the agency's environmental review
16 obligations turn on the value of the new information to the still pending decisionmaking process."
17 Id. at 951- 951, internal quotations omitted. The CEQA lead agency must decide whether project
18 changes require major revisions to the original document. (Id. at 952.)

19 123. The EIS/EIR fails to provide decision makers with sufficient analysis in numerous
20 respects including, without limitation, the following:

21 a. Vegetation and Wildlife;

22 b. Climate Change;

23 C. Groundwater;

24 d. Water Supply;

25 e. Water Quality;

2 124. The EIS/EIR Fails to Adequately Evaluate Cumulative Impacts

3 CEQA requires that the lead agency analyze cumulative impacts. Pub. Resources

4 Code § 21083(b)(2); CEQA Guidelines § 15064(h)(1). A cumulative impact is an impact created
as a result of the project when evaluated together with other past, present, and reasonably
5 foreseeable future projects causing related impacts. In performing a cumulative impacts analysis,

6 the EIR must assess the significance of the incremental addition of a project to the combined
7 individual effects of one or more separate projects. The analysis should provide sufficient data to

8

9 ensure that the cumulative effects are identified and disclosed, and should make a good faith and
reasonable effort at disclosing all cumulative impacts.

10 125.

11 the following: The EIR's cumulative impacts analysis is deficient in several respects, including

12 a. The EIS/EIR fails to analyze the combined effects of recent past water
13 transfer projects in combination with the Project;

14 b. The EIS/EIR fails to include probable future projects in its cumulative
15 impact analysis, including the Addendum to the Coordinated Operation Agreements of the Central
16 Valley Project and the State Water Project, the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
17 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary Amendments and Voluntary Settlement Agreements,
18 the Sacramento Valley Water Management Agreement, the Sites Reservoir project, and other

19 water transfers, the California Department of Water Resources' Delta Conveyance Project, and
20 amendments to State Water Project water supply contracts.

21 C. The EIS/EIR fails to analyze or disclose the cumulative effects from

22 reductions in Delta outflow.

23

24 126. The EIS/EIR's Mitigation Measures are Legally Inadequate
"An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant adverse
25 impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1). An EIR may not defer the formulation of
26 mitigation measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may specify performance standards
27 that would mitigate significant effects and may be accomplished in in more than one specified
28 way. "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR puts off analysis or

orders a report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the impact can be mitigated
2 in the manner described in the EIR." Preserve Wild Santee V. City of Santee, 210 Cal.App.4th
3 260, 280-281 (2012).

4 127. The efficacy of a mitigation measure in remedying the identified environmental

5 problem must be apparent in the EIR, Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th

6 1152, 1168; Communities for a Better Env't v. City of Richmond, (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70,
95; Gray v. County of Madera, (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116; Cleveland Nat'l Forest

8 Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts, (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 433.

9 128. The EIS/EIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures,
10 and what mitigation measures that are included in the EIS/EIR's are unenforceable or insufficient.

11 129. The EIS/EIR's inadequate mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:

12 a. Mitigation for tree loss;

13 b. Mitigation for streamflow loss;

14 C. Mitigation for groundwater depletion and subsidence;
15 d. Mitigation for impacts to Giant Garter Snakes.

16 130. Additionally, the EIS/EIR describes the Project as having a 250,000 acre feet per

17 year transfer limit, and claims that transfers would only occur in two years between 2019-2024.

18 These restrictions are de facto mitigation measures, and as such they must be defined with
19 specificity and be legally enforceable.

20 The EIS/EIR Failed to Adequately Respond to Comments

21 131. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
22 Paragraphs 1 through 128 as though fully set forth herein.

23 132. The lead agency must evaluate comments on the draft EIR and prepare written
24 responses for inclusion in the final EIR. Pub. Resources Code, § 21091(d); CEQA Guidelines, §§
25 15088(a), 15132. Conclusory statements unsupported by specific references to empirical
26 information, scientific authorities, or explanatory information are insufficient as responses to
27 comments made by agencies or the public. CEQA Guidelines, § 15088(c). Recommendations and
28 objections on major environmental issues that are rejected must be addressed in detail, and the

30
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 32 of 37

lead agency should explain its reasons for not accepting those suggestions. CEQA Guidelines, §
2 15088(c); People v. County of Kern (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 761. The final EIR must acknowledge
3 any conflicting opinions and explain why suggestions made in the comments have been rejected,
4 supporting its statements with relevant data. See Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport

5 Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 940; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. V. Board of Port
6 Comm'rs (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371.

7 133. Here, the EIS/EIR fails to meaningfully respond to comments regarding the project
8 description, baseline conditions, climate, mitigation measures, groundwater effects, water supply

9 effects, and fisheries, among others.

10 134. The EIS/EIR rejects comments regarding effects to private wells, and subsidence,
11 within the service area for Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District, without providing evidence supporting
12  its conclusions.

137. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

2 Paragraphs 1 through 136 as though fully set forth herein.

3 138. On May 17, 2019, FWS issued a BiOp for the Project regarding effects on GGS.
4| FWS' actions are arbitrary, capricious, fail to proceed as required by law, and not in accordance

5 with the ESA.

6 The Agency Action Analyzed in the BiOp is Not Coextensive with the Project

7 139. The FWS' BiOp, the Jeopardy Determination and the ITP violate the ESA because

8 they address an "agency action" that is not coextensive with the Project authorized by USBR.

9 140. USBR defines the Project, i.e. the "agency action," as "Alternative 2, Full Range of
10 Transfers (Proposed Action) involves reviewing, approving, and facilitating proposed transfers

11 over a five-year period."

12 141. The "agency action" addressed by FWS in the BiOp, however, is different. The
13 BiOp's analysis is limited to an agency action that includes transfers occurring only in "any two
14 years out of the remaining six years of the program (2019-2024)."

15 142. The FWS's jeopardy determination is also expressly premised on the assumption
16 water transfers will only occur during two of the remaining project years: "[I]t is the Service's
17 opinion that the two years of water transfers as proposed from 2019-2024, are not likely to
18 jeopardize the continued existence of the snake." (BiOp, at p. 28).

19 143. Finally, the FWS' ITS accompanying the BiOp is premised on the same assumed
20 "agency action" that water transfers will occur during only two of the remaining project years.

21 144. Contrary to FWS's express assumptions, nothing in the Project limits the number of
22 years when transfer may occur. In an apparent attempt to address the clear difference, the BiOp
23 provides that "if transfers are proposed in more than two years, Reclamation will reinitiate

24 consultation...» The ESA prohibits such a segmented or incremental-step consultation process.

25 Conner v. Burford, supra, 848 F.2d at 1454-1455.

26 145. FWS' analysis of the Project's impact on GGS is clearly limited to evaluating the
27 potential effects of only two years of water transfers, which is a different "agency action" than
28 approved by USBR. Analyzing a project that is not coextensive with the agency action authorized

32
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 34 of 37

by USBR violates the ESA, and fails to proceed in a manner required by law, by failing to
2 evaluate the effects of the entire agency action.

3 Conservation Measures Do Not Support A No Jeopardy Determination

4 146. The BiOp is arbitrary and capricious because the adopted conservation measures do
5 not support the BiOp's no jeopardy determination for the GGS.

6 147. A BiOp is arbitrary and capricious if it fails to "consider the relevant factors and
7 articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made." Ctr. for Biological
8 Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 698 F.3d 1101, 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). Here, the BiOp

9 notes that rice fields "in particular" provide cover form predators and habitat for foraging during
10 the active season. (BiOp, at p. 25.) The BiOp further notes that that Project will cause a reduction

11 in rice fields and therefore "likely result in increased stress to snakes due to the loss of areas that
12 provide foraging opportunities, the loss of cover from known predators, and the potential for
13 reduced reproduction and recruitment." (BiOp, at p. 26). Finally, the BiOp underscores the
14 importance of rice fields for cover, stating that "loss of rice lands will increase snake mortality
15 from predation if they are limited to occur in these conveyance canals and ditches." (BiOp, at
16 p.26).

17 148. Despite the BiOp's findings as to the importance of rice fields for foraging habitat
18 and predator cover, it relies on conservation measures aimed only at maintaining water in canals

19 and conveyance features. The District Court in AquAlliance previously observed with respect to
20 the earlier, vacated BiOp, "[E]ven assuming snakes are found more frequently in canals and
21 ditches, this does not explain why it is acceptable to focus on retention of water in canals and
22 ditches to the detriment of maintaining appropriate rice field habitat the BiOp itself considers

23 *important.' 373 That same criticism continues to apply to the BiOp.

24 149. The arbitrary reliance on maintaining water in ditches and canals to mitigate for
25 loss of GGS habitat is exacerbated by the arbitrary requirement to maintain two feet of water in
26 certain canals and conveyance features. FWS provides no support or evidence that two feet is

27 sufficient to adequately maintain habitat otherwise provided by the canals and conveyance

28 features.

33
First Amended Petition and Complaint of AquAlliance et al.

Case 2:20-cv-00959-JAM-DMC Document 9 Filed 06/05/20 Page 35 of 37

150. While the BiOp relies heavily for its no jeopardy determination on the
2 maintenances of canals and conveyance features, it fails to explain, much less ensure, that this will
3 actually provide suitable canal habitat for the snake.

4 The BiOp's Cumulative Effects Analysis is Flawed

5 151. The BiOp's cumulative effects analysis fails to consider the total volume of water
a 6 potentially transferred. As a result, the BiOp does not adequately consider the cumulative effects
7 of future actions on the GGS as required. 50 C.F.R. §§ 402.14(g)(3)-(4), 402.02.

8 152. Table 12 of the BiOp indicates that Richvale Irrigation District and Western Canal

9 Water District may collectively transfer up to 42,000 acre-feet per year. In fact, Western Canal and
10 Richvale may transfer up to 60,000 acre-feet per year. Additional annual transfers of 18,000 acre-
11 feet will increase the amount of valuable rice field habitat lost as a result of the SWP, in addition

12 to the failure to include cumulative effects described in Paragraph 97, above. The BiOp's no
13 jeopardy determination, therefore, is based, in part, on flawed estimates of potential cumulative
14 effects to the GGS. The BiOp's failure to consider and analyze the full cumulative effects
15 possible constitutes violates FWS' responsibility to advise "the action agency as to whether or not
16 the action, taken together with cumulative effects…is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
17 of a listed species...." Conservation Cong. V. United States Forest Serv., 720 F.3d 1048, 1055
