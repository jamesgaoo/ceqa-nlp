25 Petitioner Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 304 ("Petitioner" or

26 "Local 304") petitions this Court for a writ of mandate directed to Respondents City of Dublin, the

27 City Council of the City of Dublin, and the Planning Commission of the City of Dublin (collectively

28 "Respondents" or "City") and Real Parties in Interest VP-RPG Dublin, LLC, Rubicon Property

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

Group, and Jerry Hunt ("Real Parties" or "Applicant"), and by this verified petition, alleges as

2 follows:

3 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

4 approving the Cambria Hotel Project ("Project") without first preparing an Environmental Impact
Report ("EIR"), or alternatively a legally adequate Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"), in

6 accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public

7 Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations,

8 § 15000 et seq. The specific actions challenged are: (1) exempting the Project from CEQA review
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines' section 15182; (2) determining that none of the conditions of Public

10 Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162 applied to the Project; (3) the

11 adoption of Resolution No. 20-06 approving the Site Development Review Permit and Minor Use

12 Permit; (4) the adoption of Resolution No. 50-20 approving the Community Benefit Agreement

13 (collectively, the "Approvals").

14 2. The Project includes the demolition of an existing 1.75 acre parking lot located at

15 7950 Dublin Boulevard in the City of Dublin and the subsequent construction and operation of a

16 87,039 square foot hotel building with 58,625 square feet of parking within a two story podium. The

17 hotel would be comprised of 138 rooms with associated amenities.

18 3. Petitioner submitted evidence from experts explaining that the proposed Project may

19 have significant environmental effects on indoor air quality, biological resources, and traffic impacts

20 that were not analyzed in the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan EIR ("Specific Plan EIR") because it

21 was new information and changed circumstances had occurred since the Specific Plan EIR was
22 certified in 2011. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR or an MND for the

23 Project despite: 1) substantial evidence in the record of new information of substantial importance,

24 which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the

25 time the Specific Plan EIR was certified showing new or more substantially more severe impacts not

26

27

28
All references to the "CEQA Guidelines" refer to California Code of Regulations, title 14, division 6. chapter 3, section 15000 et seq. 2

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 discussed in the Specific Plan EIR, and 2) substantial changes that have occurred with respect to the

2 Il circumstances under which the Project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the

3 previous EIR due to the substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.

4 4. Because the exemption violates CEQA, the approvals that are reliant upon the

5 exemption must be overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct

6 Respondents to set aside the exemption and Project Approvals.

7 PARTIES

8 5. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA,

9 LOCAL UNION 304 ("LIUNA") is a labor organization with members living and working in and

10 around the City of Dublin. Local 304's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to

11 ensure safe workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to

12 improve its members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members' access to

13 safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job;

14 promoting environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its

15 members, including providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed
16 development projects; advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to

17 achieve a balance between employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high

18 standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general
19 public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our

20 national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety
21 of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development

22 projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working
23 environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted,

24 would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce
25 traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use

26 ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without

27 degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

28

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 6. Local 304 and its members in the City of Dublin have several distinct legally

2 cognizable interests in the Project. Local 304 members live, work, and recreate in the City of Dublin.

3 The interests of Local 304 and its members are unique and will be directly impacted by the Project.

4 Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, its members, and the public interest.

5 7. Local 304 and its members have direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'

0 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

7 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance

8 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

9 from the environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown

10 due to the lack of a full environmental analysis. Local 304 and its members submitted written and

11 oral comments to the Planning Commission and City Council objecting to and commenting on the

12 Project and its unsupported and inadequate environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

13 8. Respondent CITY OF DUBLIN is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of

14 Public Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental

15 review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

16 9. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF DUBLIN ("City Council*) is the

17 elected governing body of the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or

18 denying the CEQA exemption and the Project. The City Council made a final decision approving the

19 Project and the associated CEQA exemption which became effective on June 2, 2020.

20 10. Respondent PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF DUBLIN ("Planning

21 Commission") is a commission of the City of Cupertino, which reviews and takes action on certain

22 planning applications and accompanying environmental review documents prepared pursuant to

23 CEQA. The Planning Commission voted on April 28, 2020 to approve the Project and the associated

24 CEQA exemption.

25 11. Real Party in a Interest VP-RPG Dublin, LLC is a California limited liability company.

26 "VP-RPG Dublin, LLC" is identified in Resolution No. 49-20 and Resolution No. 50-20 as the

27 Project Applicant. Specifically, the Project Applicant is listed as "Jerry Hunt of VP-RPG Dublin,

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 LLC.3 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that VP-RPG Dublin, LLC is a

2 Project applicant.

3 12. Real Party in Interest Jerry Hunt is an individual. Mr. Hunt is identified as a Project

4 Applicant in the Notice of Exemption issued by the City.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 13. This Court has jurisdiction over matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

7 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and
8 21168.5.

9 14. Venue is proper in Alameda County Superior Court pursuant to California Code of
10 Civil Procedure section 394 (actions against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions

11 generally) because Respondents' main offices are located in the County of Alameda, the activities

12 authorized by Respondents will occur in the County of Alameda, and the causes of action alleged in

13 this Petition arose in the County of Alameda.

14 15. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
15 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney General.

16 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

17 16. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

18 Petition. Petitioner has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

19 prior to the close of the public hearings on the Project. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative
20 remedies to the extent required by law. (Pub. Res. Code § 21177(a).)

21 17. Respondents have taken final agency actions exempting the Project from CEQA

22 review and adopting the Approvals. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable

23 laws, including, but not limited to CEQA prior to undertaking discretionary approvals at issue in this

24 lawsuit. Petitioner possesses no further effective remedy to challenge the Approvals at issue in this

25 action other than by means of this lawsuit.

26 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

27 18. On April 28, 2020, the Planning Commission approved the Project and determined the

28 Project was exempt from CEQA review.

5

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 19. On May 7, 2020 pursuant to Municipal Code section 8.136.050, LIUNA petitioned the

2 City Council to reconsider the Planning Commission's approvals of the Project.

3 20. On June 2, 2020 Respondent City Council denied Petitioner's appeal of the Planning
4| Commission's April 28, 2020 exemption of the Project from CEQA review and Approvals for the

5 Project.

6 21. The City issued a Notice of Exemption of the Project from CEQA review on July 2,
7 2020.

8 22. This action is timely filed in accordance with all applicable statutes of limitations

9 including Public Resources Code § 21167, as modified by the California Judicial Council's

10 Emergency Rule 9 adopted April 6, 2020 and May 28, 2020 Amendment.

11 23. Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of

12 limitations.

13 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

14 24. On June 8, 2020, Petitioner served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit, in

15 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A copy of the written notice is attached

16 hereto as Exhibit A.

17 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

18 25. Pursuant to Public Resources Code 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to prepare the

19 record of proceedings in this action. A copy of Petitioner's notice of its election to prepare the record

20 of administrative proceedings relating to this action is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

21 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

22 26. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
23 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting

24 the public interest.

25 27. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the

26 general public requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable laws

27 before approving the Project.

28

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 28. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of

2 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally

3 adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review

4 and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

5 29. The necessary and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees

6 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Parties will proceed with a plan

7 and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise

8 have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of
I feasible mitigation measures.

10 IRREPARABLE HARM

11 30. Petitioner and its members live and/or work near the Project site and in the City of
12 Dublin. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents' failure to provide

13 environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the Project's true

14 impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental decision-

15 making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business owners in

16 the affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project.

17 31. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

19 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect |

20 in violation of State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal

21 remedy could fully and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.

22 LEGAL BACKGROUND

23 32. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

25 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1)). Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce
26 environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all
27 feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3)).

28

7

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 33. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

2 proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Res. Code, § 21100.)

3 The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield

4 (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th

5 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public and its

0 responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological points of no

7 return."(Bakersfield Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a "document of
8 accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact,

9 analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights Improvements

10 Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR process "protects

11 not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at

12 927.)

13 34. CEQA Guidelines section 15182 exempts from CEQA review certain residential,

14 commercial and mixed-use projects that are consistent with a specific plan, including projects

15 proximate to transit. However, if one of the events listed in CEQA Guidelines section 15162 occurs

16 with respect to a project, additional environmental review is required for a project otherwise exempt

17 under this subdivision. (CEQA Guidelines § 15182(b)(2).)

18 35. CEQA Guidelines section 15162 states that a subsequent EIR is required for a project,

19 even if a previous EIR has been certified for the project, if any of the following occur:

20 (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions

21 of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new
22 significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of
83 G previously identified significant effects;
(2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the
project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or
26 Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental

27 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant

28 effects; or

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

(3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not
have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous
EIR was certified as complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows any
of the following:
(A)The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the
O previous EIR or negative declaration;
7 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than

8 shown in the previous EIR;
(C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would

10 in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant
=902* effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation
measure or alternative; or
(D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more
15 significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to

16 adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

17 36. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial abuse

18 of discretion under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, regardless of whether a
19 different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those requirements in the

20 first place. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.) A lead agency abuses its discretion under CEQA when it fails
21 to proceed in a manner required by law or reaches conclusions unsupported by substantial evidence.

22 (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 935.) A procedural

23 failure is reviewed de novo; in contrast, greater deference is accorded an agency's factual
24 conclusions. (Id.) There is a prejudicial abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant

25 information precludes informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby thwarting

26 the statutory goals of the EIR process." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221
27 Cal.App.3d 692, 712 [citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California
28 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 403-05].)

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 37. The Project involves the development of a hotel on a 1.75-acre parcel of land located

3 at 7950 Dublin Boulevard, in the City of Dublin, California. The hotel would be 87,039 square feet,

4 and contain 138 rooms along with associated amenities. The Project also includes a 58,625 square

5 foot two-level parking garage. Currently, the Project site contains a paved parking lot, which would

6 be demolished as part of the Project.

7 38. The Project is located within the Downtown Dublin Specific Plan ("Specific Plan")

8 area in a Transit-Oriented District.

9 39. The City certified an EIR for the Specific Plan in February 2011, and Addendums to

10 the Specific Plan EIR were approved in May 2014 and December 2019. The Specific Plan EIR and

11 subsequent Addendums analyzed the construction of 1.6 million square feet of non-residential
12 development in the Transit-Oriented District.

13 40. The Specific Plan EIR and subsequent Addendums did not discuss the environmental

14 effects of indoor air quality on future employees of the Project.

15 41. Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen and has been placed on the Proposition

16 65 list by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA").

17 42. Petitioner submitted expert comments of certified Industrial Hygienist Francis

18 Offermann, PE, CIH. Mr. Offermann noted that many composite wood products used in modern hotell

19 construction contain formaldehyde-based glues which off-gas formaldehyde over a long period of

20 time. Mr. Offermann calculated that, assuming all materials are compliant with the California Air

21 Resources Board's ("CARB") formaldehyde airborne toxics control measure, employees of the

22 Project would be exposed to an increased cancer risk of approximately 16.4 per million as a result of
23 the Project's indoor formaldehyde emissions. This exceeds the Bay Area Air Quality Management

24 District's ("BAAQMD") CEQA significance threshold for airborne cancer risk of 10 per million.

25 43. Mr. Offermann relied in part on a 2019 study, by Chan et al., to calculate the Project's
26 formaldehyde emissions. The 2019 study analyzed indoor concentrations of formaldehyde for homes
27 built mostly with CARB Phase 2 compliant materials, and concluded that while these buildings had a

28 lower median formaldehyde concentration and cancer risk, the median lifetime cancer risk for homes

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

I built with CARB Phase 2 compliant composite wood products still greatly exceeded the BAAQMD

2 10 in one million cancer risk threshold.

3 44. Based on information and belief, Petitioner alleges that the increased risk to

4 employees caused by formaldehyde emissions from building materials which otherwise comply with

5 California regulations could not have been known at the time the Specific Plan EIR was certified

6 because the relevant research had not yet been conducted. The Specific Plan EIR and subsequent

7 Addendums also did not discuss the environmental effects of bird collisions with the Project's

8 windows. Indeed the Specific Plan EIR did not analyze any environmental effects to biological

9 resources, instead claiming that Specific Plan area "is an urban infill area and [biological resources]

10 do not exist on the project site and / or are not considered to have the potential to cause a significant

11 environmental impact." (Downtown Dublin Specific Plan Draft EIR, p. 4-7.)

12 45. On April 24, 2020, Petitioner submitted the expert comments of ecologist Shawn

13 Smallwood, Ph.D to the Dublin Planning Commission. Dr. Smallwood noted that within the last year,

14 the scientific community confirmed that human actions are cumulatively contributing to the rapid
15 decline of birds across North America. According to Dr. Smallwood, a 2019 study (Rosenburg et al.

16 (2019)) quantified a 29% decline of overall bird abundances across North America over the last 48

17 years, with window collisions cited as one of the leading causes of bird mortality.

18 46. Based on Project-specific information, including the clear glass widows proposed for
19 the Project, Dr. Smallwood determined that the Project will result in 69 bird deaths per year.

20 47. Dr. Smallwood also noted that the tricolored blackbird was listed as threatened under

21 the California Endangered Species Act on March 18, 2019. Records on the ecological database eBird

22 reveal the tricolored blackbird has been observed west and east of Dublin, and Dr. Smallwood

23 concludes that tricolored blackbirds likely fly across Dublin during dispersal and migration. Since the

24 Project's glass windows will be in the tricolored blackbird's air space, the Project may kill some of

25 them, resulting in a potentially significant impact on the threatened species.

26 48. The extent of the Project's impacts to the tricolored blackbird and other birds could

27 not have been known at the time the Specific Plan EIR was certified because the tricolored blackbird

28

11

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

had not yet been listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act and the relevant

2 research on the on bird abundances and window collisions had not yet been published.

3 49. The Specific Plan EIR Transportation and Circulation section found the Specific Plan

4 would result in a significant and unavoidable near-term traffic and circulation impacts on a number of
roadway segments both individually and cumulatively. (Downtown Dublin Specific Plan Draft EIR,

6 pp. 3-172-3-175.)

50. In the May 2014 Addendum to the Specific Plan EIR, the City prepared a

8 supplemental traffic analysis that concluded no new or substantially more severe significant impacts
would result from the 2014 Specific Plan Amendment.

10 51. On April 24, 2020, Petitioner submitted to the Dublin Planning Commission the expert

11 comments of traffic engineer Daniel Smith, P.E. Mr. Smith noted that the traffic and circulation
12 circumstances in the Specific Plan area have significantly changed since the Specific Plan EIR's 2010
13 analysis and the supplemental analysis in 2014. Specifically, a there has been a substantial increase in
14 the severity of traffic and circulation issues near a the Project as a result of new developments near the

15 Project not analyzed in the Specific Plan EIR.

16 52. The Specific Plan EIR was certified in 2010, and its traffic and circulation analysis

17 relied on an existing traffic database dating back to 2008. The Specific Plan EIR's impact and

18 mitigation findings were based on forecasts of near term traffic scenarios that projected conditions up

19 to 2015, and forecasts of cumulative traffic that projected traffic up to the year 2035.

20 53. The Specific Plan EIR's near-term impact analysis was based on traffic counts

21 existing in 2008, estimated traffic from a limited set of entitled projects, the Specific Plan itself, and

22 an estimate of regional traffic growth through the Project study area to 2015. The Specific Plan

23 EIR's cumulative traffic analysis is estimated based on the traffic generated by the Specific Plan and

24 the City's General plan traffic estimates for the area.

25 54. Mr. Smith observed that additional major projects have been approved in Dublin near
26 the Project since 2010, when the Specific Plan EIR was certified, and even since 2014, when the

27 2014 Addendum was approved. These are projects that were not on the entitled projects list in the

28 Specific Pan EIR study, and were therefore not included in the traffic impact analysis. Indeed many

12

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

of these projects required General Plan Amendments, so they were not reflected in either the 2015 or
2035 analyses of the Specific Plan EIR.

3 55. In his comments, Mr. Smith pointed to several large projects near the Project and their

4 traffic estimates that were not considered in the Specific Plan EIR. For example, The Boulevard
project, which was approved in 2015 and required a General Plan Amendment, will generate 22,047

6 net daily and 2,393 net PM peak hour trips. The EIR for the Dublin Kaiser Permanente Medical
Complex, which was approved in 2016 and also required a General Plan Amendment, projected that

8 the 2020 phase of the project would generate 16,570 new daily and 1,560 new PM peak hour trips,

9 while the 2035 stage of development would generate a total of 41,140 net new daily and 3,998 net

10 new PM peak bour trips. Mr. Smith concludes that these and other major projects, as well as

11 numerous small projects, were not considered in either the Specific Plan EIR traffic analysis or the

12 2014 Addendum's traffic analysis.

13 56. Based on information and belief, Petitioner alleges that, since the Specific Plan EIR

14 was certified and the 2014 Addendum was approved, the traffic conditions near the Project have

15 substantially changed as a result of numerous new large projects in the area. These changed

16 conditions will substantially increase the severity of the Project's previously identified significant

17 traffic effects, necessitating major revisions to the Specific Plan EIR.

18 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

19 57. On February 1, 2011, the City Council certified the Specific Plan EIR. On May 6,
20 2014, and December 3, 2019, the City Council adopted Addendums to the Specific Plan EIR which
21 analyzed changes to the Specific Plan.

22 58. On April 24, 2020, Petitioner submitted written comments to the Planning
23 Commission explaining that exempting the Project from CEQA review violated CEQA.
24 59. Petitioner made additional comments orally at the April 28, 2020 Planning

25 Commission hearing for the Project. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Planning Commission

26 adopted Resolution No. 20-06 approving the Site Development Review Permit and Minor Use

27 Permit, and finding the Project exempt from CEQA review because it was within the scope of

28 development analyzed by the Specific Plan EIR.

13

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 60. On May 7, 2020, Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the City Council of the Planning

2 Commission's approval of the Project and the Project's exemption from CEQA.

3 61. On June 2, 2020, Petitioner submitted supplemental comments further explaining why

4 the Project should be not exempt from CEQA review.

5 62. On June 2, 2020, the City Council held a telephonic public hearing on Petitioner's

6 appeal of the April 28, 2020 Planning Commission approval of the Project and CEQA exemption.

7 Petitioner attended and made comments at the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the City

8 Council denied Petitioner's appeal and affirming the Planning Commission's approval of the Project

9 and decision exempting the Project from CEQA review.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of CEQA)
63. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
12 full.
13 64. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by failing to proceed in a manner a
14 required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review as follows:
15 A. The City abused its discretion by exempting the Project from CEQA review
16 because new information of substantial importance, which was not known and
17 could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time
18 the Specific Plan EIR was certified shows that the Project will have significant
19 impact a on human health as a result of the Project's formaldehyde emissions, which
20 was not discussed in the Specific Plan EIR.
21 B. The Citv abused its discretion by exempting the Project from CEQA review
22 because new information of substantial importance, which was not known and
23 could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time
24 the Specific Plan EIR was certified shows that the Project will have new and
25 substantially more severe impacts on biological resources, including the tricolored
26 blackbird, which was not discussed in the Specific Plan EIR.
27 C. The City abused its discretion by exempting the Project from CEQA review
28 because substantial changes in circumstances will result in a substantial increase in a

14

1 the severity of traffic impacts previously identified in the Specific Plan EIR as a

2 significant and unavoidable.

3 65, As a result of the foregoing, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

4 approving a Project in a manner that does not comply with the Requirements of CEQA and Petition is

5 entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandate

6 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays that the Court:

approvals of the Project;
16
D.
17 Issue a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approval of the Project to be null

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act Regarding the Cambria Hotel Project (PLPA-2019-00020 & PLPA-2019-00044 (Jerry Hunt, VP-RPG Dublin, LLC))
Dear Mayor Haubert and Members of the Dublin City Council, Chair Thalblum and Members of the Dublin Planning Commission, City Clerk Moore and Mr. Hunt:
I am writing on behalf of Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union No. 304 ("LIUNA") regarding the City of Dublin's approval of the Cambria Hotel Project ("Project"). Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC) § 21167.5, that Petitioner LIUNA intends to file a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA"), PRC § 21000 et seq., against Respondents and Defendants City of Dublin, City Council of the City of Dublin, and Planning Commission of the City of Dublin (collectively the "City') in the Superior Court for the County
of Alameda, challenging the City's June 2, 2020 decision approving the Project including: (1) adopting a resolution denying Petitioner's appeal and upholding the Planning Commission's approval of the Project; (2) adopting a resolution approving a community benefit agreement between the City and VP-RPG Dublin, LLC; and (3) making findings that no additional CEQA review was required for the Project.
Among other issues, LIUNA will allege that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by exempting the project from environmental review under CEQA despite substantial evidence of: (1) new information of substantial importance, which was not known,

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Suit

and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the Downtown Dublin Environmental Impact Report ("DDSP EIR") was certified showing the Project will have significant effects not analyzed in the DDSP EIR; and (2) substantial changes in circumstances requiring major revisions of the DDSP EIR. The petition being filed will seek the following relief:

1. 2. A stay pending trial of Respondents' decisions approving the Project.
A peremptory writ of mandate ordering:
a. Respondents to vacate and set aside decisions and resolutions denying
Petitioner's appeal and approving the Project. b. Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to suspend all activity stemming from approval of the Project that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment until Respondents have taken all actions necessary to bring the certification and Project approvals into compliance with CEQA. c.

.D 50 Declaration or Environmental Impact Report in compliance with CEQA prior to any subsequent action to approve the Project.
The costs of the suit.

5. An award of attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5 and any
other applicable provisions of law or equity.
Any other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper.

LIUNA urges the Respondents to rescind their approval of the Project, to conduct the appropriate environmental review, and to prepare the appropriate CEQA document for the Project as required by law.

Sincerely,
