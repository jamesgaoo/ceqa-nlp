VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Introduction 2

1. This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the action of the City of Los Angeles,
4 Los Angeles City Council (City Council), and Los Angeles Department of City
5 Planning (collectively, City or Respondents) on November 12, 2019, and all
6 subsequent actions certifying an environmental impact report (EIR) (No. ENV-
7 2016-3991-EIR) for land-use entitlements including amending the City's General
8 Plan to change the land-use designation for the Project Site from Light Industrial
9 to Community Commercial land use within the Central City Community Plan
10 (Community Plan), and increase Floor Area Ratio (FAR) to 3.9:1 in lieu of the
11 3:1 FAR otherwise permitted for Height District 2D, a Vesting Zone Change and
12 Height District Change from M2-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D, a Site Plan Review, a
13 Master Conditional Use Permit for on-site sales and consumption of alcoholic
14 beverages, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map, and other related actions (Project
15 Entitlements) for the Southern California Flower Market Project (Project), a
16 proposed mixed-use development that will encompass two buildings, the North
17 Building and South Building, and proposes to build 323 residential apartment
18 units and 64,363 square feet of office space, 4,385 square feet of retail space,
19 63,785 square feet of wholesale space and storage, 13,420 square feet of food and 868 beverage space, and 21,295 square feet of event space on a 3,86-net-acre site
located at 709-765 South Wall Street; 306-326 East 7th Street; 750-752 South
23 Maple Avenue (Project Site).
2. 24 In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality
Act, Public Resources Code $$ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA 25 Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, S$ 15000-15387 plus 26 appendices (CEQA Guidelines); the Subdivision Map Act, Government Code 27 SS 66410-66499.38; the Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code $$ 65000- 28 66210; the City's General Plan, and the Los Angeles Municipal Code. 29 3. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related 30 environmental documentation, as described below. 31

32 Parties
33 4. Plaintiff and Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a California nonprofit 34 public benefit corporation (AHF or Petitioner), is nonprofit organization in 35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Los Angeles whose mission is to rid the world of AIDS through a network of
2 pharmacies, thrift stores, healthcare contracts, and other strategic partnerships;
m + 100N 000 generating new, innovative ways of treatment, prevention, and advocacy. There
is significant relationship between health outcomes and access to safe,
affordable housing. People with HIV are less likely to be able to stay adherent to their medications and more likely to become sicker and more infectious when
they lack stable housing and/or are homeless. AHF also operates the Heathy
Housing Foundation, which provides affordable housing to hundreds of very

10 low-income people and people at risk of homelessness in Los Angeles. The
Healthy Housing Foundation also advocates for affordable housing and against
11 gentrification. Petitioner, its employees, customers, and the many persons whom
12 Petitioner serves are beneficially interested in and will be impacted by the
13 outcome of this Project.
14 5. Defendant and Respondent City of Los Angeles is a California charter city 15 located in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the 16 jurisdictional limits of the City. 17
18 6. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles City Council is the elected governing

19 body of the City and is the body responsible for the decision being challenged
herein. 20
21 7. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles Department of City Planning is an
22 agency of the City responsible for developing, applying, and enforcing state and

23 local land-use and zoning laws within the jurisdictional limits of the City.

24 8. Defendants and Respondents Does 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
25 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said
26 Respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the
27 true names and capacities of Does 1-10 when ascertained.
28 9. Petitioner is informed, believes, and on that basis alleges that Real Party in
29 Interest Southern California Flower Growers, Inc. (Applicant), is a California
30 corporation that is the owner of the Project Site and is the applicant to the City
31 for the Project's General Plan amendments, vesting tentative tract map, and
32 other associated entitlements.
33 10. Real Parties in Interest Roes 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
34 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said
35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

I
2 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names. Roes 1-10 are agents of Applicant

3 who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition,

4 or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in the

5 subject matter of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true

6 names and capacities of Roes 1-10 when ascertained.

7 Jurisdiction and Venue
C 0 11. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) $$ 1094.5 and 1085 and Public

10 Resources Code 5$ 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to

11 issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and

12 purported approval of the Project.
12.
13 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County

14 of Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt

15 in this County. The cause alleged in this petition, or some part of that cause, arise

16 in this county. (CCP $ 393; Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150

17 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to CCP §§ 394

18 (actions against a city, county, or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since

19 the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.

20 13. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' decision to issue a

21 Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code $ 21167.

22 14. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within

23 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types

24 limited civil cases in CCP $$ 86, 86.1, or 87. of cases listed as

25 15. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to

26 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code § 21167.5.

27

28 16. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record

29 of administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public
Resources Code $ 21167.6 or other applicable laws.
30

31 17. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant

32 action and has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law

33 under Public Resources Code $ 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and

34 individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or

35 in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

HNMPLODN DO 18. The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial
interests of Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way
of this Petition will redress this beneficial interest and the likelihood of future
injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and those of its supporting
members.

19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to
set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the
10 absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in
violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner. 11
12 Statutory Framework

14 California Environmental Quality Act
15 20. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act,

16 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires state and local

17 agencies to identify the potentially significant environmental impacts of their

18 actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

19 21. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
20 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited
21 circumstances). (See, e.g., Pub. Resources Code (PRC), $ 21100 et seq.) The EIR
22 is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th

23 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature

24 intended the act to be read SO as to afford the fullest possible protection to the

25 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for

26 a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
27 22. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision
28 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a
29 project. (CEQA Guidelines $ 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public
30 and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions
31 before they are made. Thus, the EIR protects not only the environment but also
32 informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors
33 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental
34 *alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to
35 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2 (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th

3 1344, 1354.)

4 23. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental

5 damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives

6 and all feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines $ 15002(a)(2) and (3);

7 Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to provide

8 agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a

9 proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be

10 avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines $ 15002(a)(2).)

11 24. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and

12
13 procedural steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in
the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the

14

15 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ["The EIR process protects not
only the environment but also informed self-government"]; Concerned Citizens
16 2Y:.5 of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929,
936 [members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process].)
"Each public agency should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide
public involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities
and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

22 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines §
15201.) The lead agency must consider all "comments it receives on a draft a

23 environmental impact report, proposed negative declaration, or proposed
24 mitigated declaration." (PRC S 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines $ 15074(b).)

25

26 25. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been

27 given a full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.

28 26. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A

29 lead agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts

30 unless it is "otherwise permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC
§ 21002.1(c).)
31

32 27. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification is addressed in PRC $ 21092.1 and

33 CEQA Guidelines $ 15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an

34 environmental impact report after notice has been given pursuant to Section

35 21092…but prior to certification, the public agency shall give notice again

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1
2 pursuant to Section 21092 and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and

w 21153 before certifying the environmental impact report." (PRC $ 21092.1.)

4 28. "Significant new information" includes a disclosure showing that:

5 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or

6 from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

7 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would
8 result....

9
10 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different

11 from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant
environmental impacts of the project...
12
13 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and

14 conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were
precluded.
15
16 (CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n

17 (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

18 29. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. v. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112, 1130

19 ("Laurel Heights II"), the Supreme Court explained that PRC $ 21092 favors EIR §

20 recirculation prior to certification. The Court stated:

21 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment.

22 [Citation omitted.] Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an

23 EIR commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically

24 inadequate or conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect

25 meaningless triggers recirculation under section 21092.1.

26
27 Subdivision Map Act

28 30. The Subdivision Map Act, Government Code $$ 66410-66499.38 (Subdivision

29 Map Act or Act), requires local agencies to review and approve all land

30 subdivisions. The Act regulates the process for approving subdivisions and sets

31 substantive requirements for approval of land subdivisions.

32 31. The Act requires that a local agency deny approval of a land subdivision, referred

33 to as a tentative map or a parcel map, if it makes any of the following findings:

34 "(a) That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific

35 plans.... (b) That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H consistent with applicable general and specific plans. (c) That the site is not 2 physically suitable for the type of development. (d) That the site is not physically
suitable for the proposed density of development. (e) That the design of the 4 subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial 5 environmental damage or substantial and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or 6 their habitat. (f) That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements is 7 likely to cause serious public health problems. (g) That the design of the 8 subdivision or type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by 9 the public at large, for access through or use of, property within the proposed 10 subdivision…' (Gov. Code, $ 66474.)
11

12 Planning and Zoning Law
13 32. The Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code $$ 65000-66210 (Planning
14 and Zoning Law), governs the land-use planning process for city, county, and
15 local government agencies within the State of California.
16 33. The Planning and Zoning Law mandates that cities and counties prepare a 17 24858 General Plan to govern the long-term, physical development of the land under
city and county jurisdiction addressing the following eight mandatory elements:
land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, safety, and
environmental justice. (Gov. Code, $$ 65300, 65302.)
34. The Planning and Zoning Law requires that "[i]f the approval of a development
23 project results in fewer units by income category than identified in the

24 jurisdiction's housing element for that parcel and the jurisdiction does not find

25 that the remaining sites in the housing element are adequate to accommodate the

26 jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income level, the jurisdiction

27 shall within 180 days identify and make available additional adequate sites to

28 accommodate the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need by income

29 level..." (Gov. Code, § 65863(c)(2).)

30 The City's General Plan Housing Element
31 35. The Housing Element of the City's General Plan sets out a number of objectives
32 and policies for the City concerning affordable housing, including producing "an
33 adequate supply of rental and ownership housing in order to meet current and
34 projected needs" by "[e]xpand[ing] affordable rental housing for all income
35

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 groups" as well as "[p]romot[ing] a more equitable distribution of affordable
2 housing opportunities throughout the City" through "policies and incentives to
include affordable housing in residential development, particularly in mixed use
development, Transit Oriented Districts and designated Centers" that would
5 "[f]oster the development of new affordable housing units citywide and within
6 each Community Plan area." (General Plan Housing Element 2013-2021 at pp. 6-
A c 6, 6-10.)

36. In particular, the Housing Element requires the City to create "affordable

10 housing requirements for projects that…receiv[e] zone changes that result in
significantly more units than otherwise permitted...." (General Plan Housing 11 Element 2013 -021 at p. 6-19.) 12
13 The Central City Community Plan
14 37. The Central City Community Plan (Community Plan), part of the City's
15 General Plan, identifies land-use issues related to residential uses, including the
16 goal to create increased housing for all income levels. It highlights concern about
17 a lack of affordable housing and homelessness issues in the Community Plan
18 area.
19 38. The Community Plan recognizes that the majority of the area's residents live in 20 21 mostly low-income, overcrowded neighborhoods. Reflecting a concern with a
22 need for affordable housing, the Community Plan identifies a lack of affordable
housing for workers and a need to increase the range of housing choices for 23 those who live and work in the area.
24
39.
25 The Community Plan sets out several objectives including "increas[ing] the

26 range of housing choices available to Downtown employees and residents,"

27 "foster[ing] residential development which can accommodate a full range of

28 incomes," and "preserv[ing] the existing low-income housing stock." The

29 Community Plan also contains objectives, policies, and programs to promote

30 mixed-income neighborhoods, develop new affordable housing options,

31 construct low-income housing, and provide housing opportunities for homeless
individuals.

2 The Los Angeles Municipal Code's Affordable Housing Requirements
(Measure JJJ)
3 40.
4 The Los Angeles Municipal Code (Municipal Code or LAMC) imposes

5 additional affordable housing requirements on projects with ten or more

6 residential dwelling units seeking a general plan amendment, zone change, or

7 height district change resulting in an increase in allowable residential floor area

8 density or height or a residential use where not previously allowed. (LAMC $

9 11.5.11.)

10 41. Section 11.5.11, subd. (a)(1) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a

11 general plan amendment, zone change, or height district change resulting in a

12 residential density increase greater than 35% allocate "no less than 5% of the total

13 units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income households, and either 6% of

14 the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income households or 15% of the

15 total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households."

16 42. Section 11.5.11, subd. (a)(1) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a
17 general plan amendment, zone change, or height district change to allow

18 residential uses where residential uses were not previously allowed allocate "no
08d less than 5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income
households, and either 11% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low

22. Income households or 20% of the total units at rents affordable to Lower Income
households."
23
24 The Los Angeles Municipal Code as to Conditional Use Permits for Alcohol

25 Sale and Dispensing
43.
26 The City's Municipal Code requires a conditional use permit (CUP or

27 Conditional Use) for the sale or dispensing of alcoholic beverages, including

28 beer and wine. (LAMC $ 12.24(W).)

29 44. The City is required to deny a CUP unless it properly finds that (1) "the project

30 will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood," (2) "the

31 project's location, size, height, operations and other significant features will be

32 compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent

33 properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare and

34 safety," and (3) "the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and

35 provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 applicable specific plan." (LAMC S 12.24(E).)
2 45. In addition, the Municipal Code requires the City to deny a CUP if the sale or M WLOON dispensing of alcohol will (1) "adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent
community,' (2) "result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or
dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages.in the area of the City
involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the California
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
concentration." and (3) "detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
communities in the area of the City involved." (LAMC $ 12.24(W)(1)(a).) 10

11 Private Attorney General
12 46. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public
13 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this petition will confer a substantial
14 benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses, and taxpayers of
15 the City, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by
16 requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements
17 applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and 18 prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions 19 with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal requirements;
20 and by prohibiting Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project
21 until they have fully complied with these legal requirements.
22
23 47. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in CCP $ 1021.5 if it
prevails in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of 24 these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees 25 pursuant to that section. 26
27 Factual Background
28 48. On May 22, 2017, the City published the Notice of Preparation (NOP)
29 identifying the scope of the environmental issues for the Project. The NOP was
30 sent to responsible agencies and interested parties for a 30-day review period.
31 49. On June 8, 2017, the City held a Public Scoping Meeting for the Project. 32

33 50. The Draft EIR for the Project (No. ENV-2016-3991-EIR) was issued on

34 September 20, 2018, for a 45-day review period with the comment period

35 expiring on November 5, 2018.

- 51. On September 20, 2018, a Notice of Availability and a Notice of Completion of 2 the Draft EIR were issued.
3 52.
4 On April 12, 2019, the City issued the Final EIR for the Project.

5 53. The Final EIR concluded that the following impacts are significant but

6 determined to be mitigated to less than significant levels:

7 a. Air Quality

8 b. Geology and soils
9 C. Noise
10 d. Tribal cultural resources
11 54. The Final EIR determined that the 12 Project would not result in any significant

13 and unavoidable environmental impacts.

14 55. On July 26, 2019, and August 7, 2019, the City prepared two Errata to the Final

15 EIR, dated and posted on the Department of City Planning website. The first

16 Erratum clarified the Project Description as to the floor area of event space, and
17 modified Mitigation Measure E-1. In Erratum No. 2, Project Design Feature L-1
18 was revised to clarify the language regarding the coordination requirements
4878 between the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and
other public transit agencies.
56. On June 3, 2019, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency approved Vesting Tentative
Tract Map No. 74568 case and certified the EIR, and certified that the Final EIR
23 had been completed in compliance with CEQA; reflects the City's independent
24 judgment and analysis; and has been presented to the decision-making body,
25 which reviewed and considered the information in it before approving the
26 Project.

27 57. On July 13, 2019, the Deputy Advisory Agency's decision was appealed by the
28 American Florists Exchange and the Coalition for Responsible Equitable
29 Economic Development (CREED LA).
30 58. On August 8, 2019, the City Planning Commission (CPC) heard the appeals filed
31 by the American Florists Exchange and CREED LA. At the hearing, the CPC
32 voted to deny the appeals, sustained the actions of the Advisory Agency in
33 certifying the EIR and in approving VTT Map No. 74568, and for the related
34 Case No. CPC-2016-3990-GPA-VZC-HD-MCUP-SPR, recommended that the

Community Plan to re-designate the Site from Light Industrial to Community

5 Commercial land use; (2) remove Footnote No. 2 to allow a for a Floor Area Ratio

6 (FAR) increase to 3.9:1 in lieu of the 3:1 FAR otherwise permitted for existing

7 Height District 2D; and (3) approve a Vesting Zone Change and Height District

00 Change from M2-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D. In addition, the CPC approved a Master

9 59. Conditional Use and Site Plan Review for the Project.

10 On August 26, 2019, the City Planning Commission issued separate Letters of

11 Determination for both Case Nos. CPC-2016-3990-GPA-VZC-HD-MCUP-SPR

12 60. and VTT Map No. 74568 effectuating its August 8, 2019 decision.

13 On September 5, 2019, Petitioner appealed both Case Nos. CPC-2016-3990-

14 GPA-VZC-HD-MCUP-SPR and VTT Map No. 74568 to the Planning and Land

15 Use Management (PLUM) Committee of the Los Angeles City Council. In its

16 appeal letter, Petitioner argued that the Project failed to comply with the City's

17 affordable housing requirements, especially under Measure JJJ. Also, a second-

18 61. level Tract Appeal was filed by CREED LA.

19 On October 18, 2019, a third Erratum was issued by the City to modify the

20 existing analysis regarding the Project. Erratum No. 3 included several

21 attachments, including a new "Updated Geotechnical Investigation, Southern

22 California Flower Mart Proposed Mixed-Use Development, 747 & 755 South

23 Wall Street, Los Angeles, California," which was prepared by Geocon West, Inc.,

24 in September 2019, a memo supplementing the air-quality analysis for the

25 Project, and new analysis of construction noise and vibrations, including at the
Textile Building Lofts.

26 62.

27 On October 28, 2019, Petitioner submitted a comment letter to support its

28 appeal to the PLUM Committee, which argued that the Project (1) does not

29 comply with Measure JII's affordable housing requirements, (2) does not comply

30 with the City's Housing Element of the General Plan and the Central City

31 Community Plan, and (3) fails to provide substantial evidence to support the

32 required findings to approve the Master Conditional Use Permit for the sale and

33 dispensing of alcohol.
63.
34 On October 29, 2019, the PLUM Committee of the Los Angeles City Council

35 held a public hearing to consider the Project and the pending appeals by

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- Petitioner and CREED LA for both Case Nos. CPC-2016-3990-GPA-VZC-HD-
2 MCUP-SPR and VTT Map No. 74568. PLUM made the following 3 recommendations for City Council action:
4

5 a. find that the Advisory Agency has reviewed and considered the

6 information contained in the EIR prepared for the Project; certify that the

7 EIR was completed in compliance with CEQA, that the EIR was presented

8 to the Advisory Agency as a decision-making body of the lead agency, and

9 that the EIR reflects the independent judgment and analysis of the lead

10 agency; and adopt the Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP) prepared

11 for the EIR;

12 b. adopt the findings of the PLUM Committee as the Findings for Council;

13 C. resolve to grant in part and deny in part the appeals filed by Petitioner and
14 CREED LA;

15 d. approve the Vesting Tentative Tract Map;
16 e. request the applicant to work with CREED LA for the construction of the
17 Project,
18 f. request the applicant to further evaluate the cost and the affordability of the 19 8388 housing project;
g. approve the Master Conditional Use Permit, Site Plan Review, General
Plan Amendment to the Central City Community Plan; Vesting Zone
Change, and Height District Change;
24 h. and other related recommendations.

25 64. The PLUM Committee voted to forward the Project to the City Council for its
26 consideration.

27 65. At the October 29, 2019 hearing, the PLUM Committee made modifications to
28 the Project, including to the MMP and conditions of approval. Among these
29 modifications, the MMP added new significant information regarding a new
30 "Updated Geotechnical Investigation, Southern California Flower Mart
31 Proposed Mixed-Use Development, 747 & 755 South Wall Street, Los Angeles,
32 California," which was prepared by Geocon West, Inc., in September 2019,
33 which was included as Attachment 1 to Erratum No. 3. Additionally, Project
34 Description in the Letter of Determination and Conditions of Approval were
35 modified to include the North area parking building. Third, new analysis of

14

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 construction noise at the Textile Building Lofts was included.
N 0H100A 00 66. On November 12, 2019, the City Council considered and adopted the PLUM
Committee Report related to the Project and the pending appeals, approving the
Project.

67. On November 15, 2019, the City issued a Notice of Determination, effectuating
actions the City Council took at its November 12, 2019 meeting.

First Cause of Action
(Violations of CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply with CEQA)
10 68. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here. 11
69. 12 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies

13 with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for

14 public review and comment on the project and associated environmental

15 documentation. An EIR must provide an adequate project description and

16 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently

17 consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.

18 70. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying a Final EIR that fails to adequately
19 disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts, including
20 but not limited to:
21 a. Failure to recirculate the Draft EIR despite the inclusion of significant new
22 information in the Final EIR and new substantive analysis in the EIR
23 Errata, including the modifications to the Project as well as the Project's
24 Mitigation Monitoring Plan, new information regarding a new noise study,

25 and new information regarding the North Parking Addition.

26 b. Failure to provide an adequate project description. The EIR's project
27 description is inadequate in significant ways, including that it fails to
28 include the North Parking Addition in the Project description.
29 C. Adoption of inadequate mitigation measures. Some of the approved
30 mitigation measures are vague, deferred, unenforceable, ineffective, or
31 inadequate to truly mitigate the Project's impacts. Among these ineffective
32 and inadequate mitigation measures is Mitigation Measure C-1 regarding
33 air quality impacts during construction, which relies on incorrect modeling
34 and is unlikely to reduce impacts to less than significant.
35

15

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-
2
3 d. Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate potential geology and

4 soil impacts, including from construction of the North Parking Addition.

5 Additionally, the analysis lacks substantial evidence to support the

00 N O conclusion that the Project will not result in significant geology or soil
impacts. The EIR lacks adequate analysis to show Mitigation Measure E-1
will be effective, and the conclusion that it will result in less than significant
impacts is unsupported. The measure is vague, uncertain, and improperly
deferred.

10 e.

11 Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts on air

12 quality by failing to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's

13 impact to air quality, including operational emissions, and especially as to

14 the release of criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants such as

15 diesel particulate matter and their impacts to sensitive receptors in and

16 f around the Project Site. The analysis is based on a flawed emissions model.

17 Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on

18 greenhouse-gas emissions. The EIR fails to support the conclusion that

19 greenhouse-gas emissions will be less than significant. Appropriate

20 significance thresholds were not selected, and the EIR does not adequate

21 justify the selection of thresholds. In particular, the EIR's analysis of

22 greenhouse-gas emissions violates CEQA because it adopts, as a

23 significance threshold, whether the Project is compatible with the

24 applicable regulatory plans and policies to reduce greenhouse-gas

25 emissions, including AB 32, but fails to demonstrate compliance with AB

26 32 under the criteria given in Center for Biological Diversity v. Dept. of Fish

27 and Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204.

g.

28 Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on

29 land use and planning, including by failing to consider or mitigate for the

30 Project's inconsistencies with the City's General Plan and Community

31 Plan. The analysis is cursory and conclusory despite the Project's

32 introduction of new residential uses on the Project Site.

33
34 h. Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's noise
impacts by failing to adequately analyze, disclose, or mitigate for the

35 Project's construction noise impacts as well as operational noise impacts,
particularly on nearby sensitive receptors. Mitigation measures for noise

16

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

2 impacts are vague and inadequate, and the record lacks support to show

G they are feasible and enforceable and will be effective to reduce noise and

4 vibration impacts.

un • i. Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on
population and housing, by failing to analyze the Project's induced

LO 0 gentrification and displacement impact on low-income residents and
associated human-health impacts.
j.

10 Failure to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on
transportation and traffic, including by failing to analyze, disclose, or

11 mitigate for impacts on local traffic as well as freeway traffic. The EIR and

12 traffic analysis do not adequately evaluate construction and operation

13 impacts on surrounding land uses. The construction traffic management

14 plan is improper mitigation. Additionally, the analysis of parking supply

15 and capacity is inadequate, and the Parking Demand Study is deficient. is

16

17 k. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts.

18 The EIR's analysis of cumulative air-quality impacts violates CEQA

19 because the analysis is based on the contention that the air-quality impacts

20 of nearby projects are not significant, and therefore the Project's air-quality

21 cumulative impacts are not significant.
71.
22 CEQA requires a detailed good-faith response to comments the agency disagrees

23 with. Many unadopted mitigation measures were proposed in public comments

24 on the Project, and Respondents failed to adequately respond to some of those
comments.

25

26 72. Many of the mitigation measures adopted for the Project are couched as Project

27 Design Features in the EIR. This violates CEQA, since there is no legal

28 mechanism under which Respondents can enforce them. CEQA requires

29 mitigation measures to be labeled as such and to be enforceable.
73.
30 As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents

31 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply

32 with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,

33 Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and purported approval of the Project
must be set aside.
34

2 Second Cause of Action

3 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and

4 Overriding Considerations)
74.
5
75. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here.

6 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

7 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further

8 requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record

9 supports the conclusions it has reached.

10 76. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

11 of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including

12 but not limited to the following:

13

14 a. The determination that the no new information or evidence was presented

15 to the City, especially regarding (1) the changes made in the Notices of

16 Errata dated July 26, 2019, August 7, 2019, and October 18, 2019, and (2)

17 the City's post-Final EIR changes to the Mitigation Monitoring Program.

800S. b. The determination that certain environmental impacts would be less than
significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
Project's significant effects on the environment.
c. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation
measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the
Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the no-Project

24 alternative and the other alternatives examined in the EIR.
77.
25 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

26 discretion by making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply

27 with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon.

28 Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and purported approval

29 of the Project must be set aside.

30 Third Cause of Action

31

32 (Violations of Subdivision Map Act)
78.
33 Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here.

34 79. Respondents abused their discretion under the Subdivision Map Act in

35 approving the Project's tentative vesting tract map because the findings are not

18

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence before Respondents at
2
OoNaIA the time of the approval required the denial of the Project due to its
inconsistency with the Subdivision Map Act's substantive requirements.
80. The Project is inconsistent with the Subdivision Map Act's requirements,
including because the Project's location and design are inconsistent with
applicable general and specific plans. Moreover, the Project site is not physically
suitable for the type of development and the density of the Project as approved.
Finally, the Project is likely to cause substantial environmental damage and

10 serious public health problems and conflicts with easements acquired by the

11 public at large.

12 81. The Project is also inconsistent with applicable general plan and community plan

13 and local codes governing development density as required by the Subdivision

14 Map Act.

15 82. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

16 discretion by making determinations and adopting findings that do not comply

•17 with the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act. Accordingly, Respondents'
18 approval of the Project must be set aside.
19 858 Fourth Cause of Action
(State Planning and Zoning Law, Violation of City's General Plan, Central City
Community Plan)

23 83. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here.

24 84. As required by state law, the City has a General Plan that governs land use

25 planning throughout the City.

26 85. The Community Plan is integrated into the land use element of the City's

27 General Plan and applies to the Project Site.

28 86. The Project fails to comply with the objectives and policies set out in the City's
29 Community Plan, as well as the framework, air quality, conservation, housing,
30 noise, open space, service systems/public recreation, safety, and mobility
31 elements and objectives of the General Plan.
32 87. In particular, the Project's decision regarding units set aside for affordable
33 housing conflicts with the objectives and policies of the Housing Element of the
34 City's General Plan and the Community Plan. The moderate-income units
35

19

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Hd
2 proposed for the Project will not serve the neighborhood residents or meet the
needs of individuals who are homeless, individuals at risk of homelessness, and

4 other special-needs populations, including persons living with HIV/AIDS. The

5 City's conclusion to the contrary is erroneous.
88.
6 The Project is inconsistent with the zoning for the Project Site as provided in the

7 City's Municipal Code, including because it is inconsistent with density limits,

8 permitted floor-area-ratio, and affordable housing requirements for the Project

9 Site.

10 89.

11 Respondents failed to issue a finding and failed to support any such finding with
substantial evidence that addresses potential displacement of residents with

12 regard to potential displacement of residents in relation to the Project.

13 90.

14 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

15 discretion by making determinations and adopting findings that do not comply

16 with the requirements of the City's General Plan. Accordingly, the Court should

17 order that Respondents' approval of the Project as well as construction and

18 operation of the Project be vacated and stayed and declare that Respondents
violated its lawful duties under the City's Municipal Code.

19

20 Fifth Cause of Action

21 (Los Angeles Municipal Code, Measure JJJ)

22 91. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here.

23 92.

24 Measure JJJ was adopted by the voters in 2016. Both the Project and the City's
implementation of Measure JJJ in the Municipal Code are inconsistent with

25 Measure JJJ as adopted by the voters.

26 93.

27 Section 11.5.11, subd. (a)(1) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a

28 general plan amendment, zone change, or height district change resulting in a

29 residential density increase greater than 35% allocate "no less than 5% of the total

30 units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income households, and either 6% of

31 the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income households or 15% of the
total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households."

32 94.
33 Section 11.5.11, subd. (a)(1) of the LAMC requires that rental projects seeking a

34 general plan amendment, zone change, or height district change to allow

35 residential uses where residential uses were not previously allowed allocate "no
less than 5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income

-
2
L000Nc AW households, and either 11% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low
Income households or 20% of the total units at rents affordable to Lower Income
households."

95. Respondents granted the Project a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and
Height District Change resulting in a residential density increase greater than
35% and permitting residential uses where residential uses were not previously
allowed.

9 96.

10 The Project does not provide any of its residential housing units to extremely low

11 97. income, very low income, or lower income households.

12 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

13
14 discretion by making determinations and adopting findings that do not comply
with the requirements of the City's Municipal Code. Accordingly, the Court

15 should order that Respondents' approval of the Project as well as construction

16 and operation of the Project be vacated and stayed and declare that Respondents

17 violated lawful duties under the City's Municipal Code.

18
19 Sixth Cause of Action

20 (Los Angeles Municipal Code, Master Conditional Use for On-Site and Off-Site
Alcohol Sales)

21
22 98.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-67 as if fully set forth here.
99.

23 The City's Municipal Code requires a CUP for the sale or dispensing of alcoholic

24 beverages, including beer and wine. (LAMC $ 12.24(W).)

25 100. The City is required to deny a CUP unless it properly finds that (1) "the project

26 will enhance the built environment in the surrounding neighborhood," (2) "the

27 project's location, size, height, operations and other significant features will be

28 compatible with and will not adversely affect or further degrade adjacent

29 properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare and

30 safety," and (3) "the project substantially conforms with the purpose, intent and

31 provisions of the General Plan, the applicable community plan, and any

32 applicable specific plan." (LAMC S 12.24(E).)

33
34 101. In addition, the Municipal Code requires the City to deny a CUP if the sale or
dispensing of alcohol will (1) "adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent

35 community," (2) "result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or
dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages…in the area of the City

21

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the California
2 Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
concentration…" and (3) "detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
4 communities in the area of the City involved." (LAMC $ 12.24(W)(1)(a).)

6 102. The Project will not enhance the built environment in the surrounding

7 neighborhood; is not compatible with adjacent properties, the surrounding

8 neighborhood, or the public health and safety; and does not substantially

9 conform with the purpose, intent, and provisions of the City's General Plan,

10 applicable community plans, or any applicable specific plan.

11 103. In addition, the Project will adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent

12 community, result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or

13 dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, and detrimentally affect

14 nearby residentially zoned communities.

15 104. In particular, Respondents failed to support with substantial evidence the finding

16 that there is not an "undue concentration" of premises for the sale or dispensing

17 of alcoholic beverages in the area under the State of California Department of

18 Alcoholic Beverage Control Guidelines, noting that there are 28 licenses in the

19 Project's Census Tract, far in excess of the State of California's Department of

20 Alcoholic Beverage Control licensing criteria that allocate three on-sale licenses

21 and one off-sale license to the Project's Census Tract.

22 105. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
23 discretion by making determinations and adopting findings that do not comply
24 with the requirements of the City's Municipal Code. Accordingly, the Court
25 should order that Respondents' approval of the Project as well as construction
26 and operation of the Project be vacated and stayed and declare that Respondents
27 violated lawful duties under the City's Municipal Code.
28
29 Prayer for Relief

30 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment in its favor and for relief as follows:

31 A. For a writ of mandate commanding Respondents to vacate and withdraw the
