Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

Petitioner and Plaintiff, James Irrigation District ("Petitioner," "James," or "JID") brings
this Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
("Petition") and alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. This action is commenced pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., and its implementing regulations in
California Code of Regulations, title 14, chapter 3, section 15000 and following ("CEQA
8 Guidelines"). This Petition challenges certain actions taken and determinations made by
9 Respondent Westlands Water District ("Respondent" or "Westlands") on January 21, 2020,
10 including approval and/or adoption of a defective Final Environmental Impact Statement /
11 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), including associated findings and mitigation measures,
ORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12| and approval the Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchange Program ("Project") based on that EIR.
13 2. The EIR is a joint document prepared under both CEQA and the National
14 Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. ("NEPA"), with the United States

O seyO METaUL NOISSHIONd ON 15 Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") as the NEPA lead agency. In
16 this action, JID is challenging the EIR under CEQA, not NEPA.
17 3. Among other things, the Project approves the continuation, for twenty years, of
18 annual water exchanges that deprive Petitioner and its agricultural water users of the high quality
ALFUAVIY GALINIT 19 surface water it has contracted to receive from Reclamation as part of the Central Valley Project
20 ("CVP*), and in lieu of such supplies force Petitioner to receive poor quality groundwater. All
21 told, over the course of two decades or 20 years the Project would transfer up to 400,000 acre-
22 feet ("AF")' of Petitioner's high quality surface supplies to landowners in Westlands and replace
23 it with up to 421,053 AF (or up to 26,316 AF a year) of highly saline native groundwater
24 discharged by Project groundwater wells of the Mendota Pool Group ("MPG") into the Mendota
25 Pool upstream of Petitioner's point of diversion. That groundwater would have detrimental
26 levels of salinity equaling or exceeding 1,600 milligrams per liter ("mg/L") of total dissolved
27 An acre-foot is the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot, or approximately 28 325,851 US gallons. (O.W.L. Foundation v. City of Rohnert Park (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 568, 576 fn.2.)

Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

solids ("TDS"), in addition to high concentrations of boron, that result in surface water
2 degradation and exceedances of applicable water quality standards and standards of significance.
3 These exchanges, like the same or substantially similar past exchanges of similar projects, will
cause continuing environmental harm and result in significant adverse impacts and cause
5 irreversible environmental damage to the Petitioner and the lands within its boundaries that are
6 not properly considered in the EIR, including without limitation impacts on surface water quality,
prime farmland, crop yields, soil characteristics, groundwater quality, and irrigation
8 infrastructure within JID. Due to Petitioner's and its water users' location downstream of the
groundwater discharges they will bear the brunt of the environmental damage wrought by the
10 Project, yet the Project fails to include any mitigation or alternatives whatsoever that would

à 11 reduce, minimize, or avoid causing these significant and irreversible environmental effects. In

Young Wooldridge, L 12 addition to Petitioner, the State of California, by and through its California Department of Water
13 Resources ("DWR") and California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"), and others,

JO SADYJO MET 3UI A LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 14 submitted comment letters contending that the EIR for the Project does not comply with CEQA.
15 PARTIES

16 4. Petitioner is presently, and at all times relevant hereto has been, a public entity

18 20510 et seq. Petitioner's boundaries consisting of approximately 25,000 acres are located
19 exclusively within the County of Fresno.
20 5. Petitioner brings this action against Westlands in its capacity as the CEQA Lead
21 Agency for the Project. Westlands is a public entity formed and existing pursuant to the
22 California Water District Law, Water Code sections 34010 et seq. Westlands' boundaries
23| encompass lands in the County of Fresno and the County of Kings.
24 6. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest Mendota Pool Group
25 ("MPG") is presently, and at all times relevant hereto has been, an unincorporated association
26 with its office and/or principal place of business in Fresno County.
27 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest,
28 sued herein as DOES 1-100, and therefore sues such persons, entities, and organizations by these

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

Background

16. Mendota Pool is a small reservoir created by Mendota Dam at the confluence of
8 the San Joaquin River and the Fresno Slough. It is also located at the terminus of the Delta-
9 Mendota Canal ("DMC"), a conveyance facility of the Central Valley Project ("CVP") that
10 conveys water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to irrigate lands on the west side of the
11 San Joaquin Valley as well as to replace San Joaquin River water impounded at Friant Dam.
INCLUDING PROFESSTONAL CORPORATIONS d'11'a8pupjooM Suno 12 17. Petitioner James Irrigation District has riparian water rights on the San Joaquin
13 River that were impaired by the impoundment of the San Joaquin River at Friant Dam. In
14 exchange for those water rights, Petitioner receives up to 9,700 acre-feet per year under a
15 Settlement Contract with Reclamation. Those deliveries are made through the DMC, through O SEDIO METOUL 16 Mendota Pool, and into Fresno Slough, where they enter the James Bypass, a canal that carries
17 water from Fresno Slough into James Irrigation District's distribution system. Petitioner also has
18 a Water Supply Contract with USBR for up to 35,300 acre-feet of CVP water, to be delivered in
19 the same manner. In contrast to Project groundwater, the quality of the surface water Petitioner
LAVII CELINIIV 20 is entitled to receive under said long-term contracts is suitable for agricultural crop production
21 within Petitioners' boundaries,
22 18. The Settlement Contract also contains water quality criteria for the water
23| delivered under that contract, specifically limits on the salinity of the deliveries measured as total
24 dissolved solids ("TDS"). Those criteria are as follows:
25 a. "Daily: The quality of water shall not exceed a mean daily value of eight
hundred (800) parts per million of total dissolved solids." 26

27 b. "Monthly: The quality of water shall not exceed a mean monthly value of six
28 hundred (600) parts per million of total dissolved solids."

II 13323-71\00157153.004 5
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

c. "Annual: The quality of water shall not exceed a mean annual value during
the year of four hundred and fifty (450) parts per million of total dissolved

solids."

d. "Five-year: The average quality of water for any five (5) consecutive years
shall not exceed a mean value of four hundred (400) parts per million of total

dissolved solids."

19. JID's irrigation operations rely on the higher quality water JID receives through
8 the DMC, which it blends with other water sources, including groundwater, to achieve acceptable

9 levels of salinity as well as other constituents of concern, such as boron.
10 Project Details

11 20. The Project involves the use of existing groundwater wells, operated by MPG, to
Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 pump poor quality groundwater and discharge it into Mendota Pool as part of an exchange
13 agreement (or series of exchange agreements) over the course of 20 years. Similar exchanges
14 were approved in 1998 (10-year program), 2005 (10-year program), and 2015 (4-year extension).

O SADYJO MET OUL ROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS 15 21. The Project would discharge up to 26,316 acre-feet per year as part of an exchange
16 agreement (or series of exchange agreements) with USBR. Under the proposed exchange, USBR
17 would reduce deliveries from the DMC into Mendota Pool by 25,000 acre-feet per year ("AFY"),
18 which would be replaced by the groundwater plus a 5 percent "leave-in" quantity of groundwater
19 to the Mendota Pool up to a maximum volume of 26,316 AFY pumped by the Project. In return,
T1 Q3LINII 1 20 USBR would deliver 25,000 acre-feet of delta water to MPG lands in Westlands through the San
21 Luis Canal.

22 22. The Project would also discharge up to 12,000 AFY for "Adjacent Overlying
23 Use," meaning irrigation of lands near Mendota Pool, effectively using the pool as a conveyance
24 facility.

25 23. The Project groundwater to be discharged into the pool by MPG and delivered
26 I downstream to Petitioner through James intake at the James Booster Plant (or P-Booster Station)
27 exceeds applicable water quality standards and is significantly more saline than the DMC
28 supplies upon which Petitioner and its water users rely, which will have adverse impacts and

1/13323-71\00157153.004 6
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

cause irreversible damage to the physical environment including crop yields, soil characteristics,
2 and infrastructure within Petitioner's boundaries and elsewhere.

3 A Process

24. Petitioner is informed and believes that, in or about April 2013, Westlands
submitted a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project to the State Clearinghouse, which
6 received the notice on April 8, 2013.

25. Petitioner is informed and believes that, in or about November 2018, Westlands
81 submitted a Notice of Completion and Environmental Document Transmittal to the State
Clearinghouse, which received the notice on November 30, 2018. The notice indicated that the
10 Draft Environmental Impact Statement / Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Project
was completed.

FESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 26. On January 14, 2019, Petitioner submitted timely comments on the DEIR to
13 Westlands and Reclamation.

14 27. Also on January 14, 2019, DWR submitted timely comments on the DEIR to

O SaJyJO METaUI 15 Westlands and Reclamation.

16 28. On January 18, 2019, CDFW submitted comments on the DEIR to Westlands and

17 Reclamation.

18 29. Other public agencies, including the United States Environmental Protection
19 Agency, the Friant Water Authority, the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, and others,
11 Q3LIAIT1 20 also submitted timely comments on the DEIR to Westlands and Reclamation.
21 30. Petitioner is informed and believes that, in or about October 2019, Westlands
22 released the Final EIR.

23 31. Prior to Westlands' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project, Petitioner
24 submitted further comments on November 18, 2019 and December 20, 2019 to Westlands and
25 Reclamation.

26 32. Westlands approved and/or adopted the EIR in its Resolution No. 101-20 and
27 approved the Project in its Resolution No. 102-20 on January 21, 2020 and filed a Notice of
28 Determination ("NOD") with the Fresno County Clerk on January 23, 2020, which was received

13323-71\00157153.004
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

by the State Clearinghouse on January 27, 2020. A copy of the NOD is attached hereto as Exhibit
2 "B."

3 STANDARD OF REVIEW

33. CEQA was enacted to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment
shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001(d).)
CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with assurances that "the
agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions,." (Laurel
8 Heights Improvement Assn., supra, (1988) 47 Cal.3d at 392 [quoting No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 86].) The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely
10 to result in informed decision making on the part of the agency, it is also to inform the public so
11 they can respond to an action with which they disagree. (Id.)

)SaOyHO MET aUL NG PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 34. Accordingly, an EIR must fully disclose and analyze all of a project's potentially
13| significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100(b)(1); CEQA Guidelines §
14 15151.) A CEQA lead agency must mitigate or avoid the significant effects of the projects it
15 approves whenever it is feasible to do so. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.1(b).)
16 35. Abuse of discretion under CEQA is established if the agency has not proceeded
17 in a manner required by law or if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by
18 substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
19 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA

CI Q3.LIAIT1 20 36. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and violated CEQA by certifying
21 an EIR for the Project that is inadequate as an informational document, is not supported by
22 substantial evidence, and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA
23 Guidelines. The defects in the EIR include, but are not limited to, the following:
24 Failure to Consider Impacts to James Irrigation District

25 37. CEQA requires that the EIR include "a detailed statement setting forth ... [a]ll
26 significant effects on the environment of the proposed project." (Pub. Resources Code,
27 21100(b)(1).) The "environment" relevant to CEQA analysis is the entire "area which will be
a 28 affected by a proposed project." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5.)

1113323-71\00157153.004 8
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

38. Therefore, the lead agency must consider "the effects a project will have on areas
2 outside the boundaries of the project area." (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa
3 County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 369.) Consequently, "the project area
does not define the relevant environment for purposes of CEQA when a project's environmental
5 effects will be felt outside the project area." (Muzzy Ranch Co. V. Solano County Airport Land
6 Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 387-88, citing County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 of Los Angeles
County v. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1582-83.)

39. Despite their close proximity to Project groundwater well discharges and the
obvious resulting downstream adverse impacts that Project groundwater discharges will have on
10 Petitioner and its water users and environmental resources within Petitioner's boundaries, the
11 EIR inexplicably fails to study or include any discussion of the impacts the Project will have on
B Y PARTNERSHIP INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS 12 the lands within JID, and the EIR does not include those lands in its Primary Study Area. (EIR,
I 'dãpupjooM Suno 13 Fig. 4.)
14 40. The Project will have significant, adverse impacts to environmental resources

o saJyJo METPUL 15 within JID, including without limitation exceedances of JID's contractual water quality
16 standards, applicable standards of significance, reduced crop yields, alterations of the soil, and
17 adverse effects on surface water and groundwater quality.

18 41. Water quality data collected at the terminus of the DMC and at the James P-
19 Booster Station (JID's intake from the Fresno Slough into the James Bypass) demonstrates that
LIMITED LEA 20 the previously authorized MPG exchanges have adversely and significantly impacted JID's
21 surface water quality. Attached hereto as Exhibit "C" are TDS data measured at Check 21 (the
22 terminus of the DMC) and TDS data measured at the P-Booster Station. The Check 21 data show
23 almost no exceedances of JID's contractual water quality standards, whereas the P-Booster
24 Station data show numerous exceedances.

25 42. Technical analysis performed by EKI Environment & Water, Inc. ("EKI") and
26 submitted to Westlands with JID's comments demonstrates that the increase in salinity between
27 Check 21 and the P-Booster Station are due, almost exclusively, to MPG pumping groundwater
28 into Mendota Pool under its prior exchange programs. A copy of that technical analysis is

1113323-71\00157153.004 9
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

attached hereto as Exhibit "D."

43. This increased surface water salinity also has adverse impacts within JID. For
3 example, technical analysis performed by Provost & Pritchard Consulting Group ("P&P") and
submitted to Westlands with JID's comments determined that, in 2014, salinity levels at the P-
5 Booster Station were high enough to cause 10% or greater yield loss to sensitive crops such as
6 onions, lettuce, and almonds, which together make up over 42% of the cropped acreage in JID.
P&P also found that boron levels caused by MPG pump-ins were sufficient to damage sensitive
8 crops, and boron is more difficult to leach out of the root zone than TDS, meaning these boron
9 levels cause persistent problems for sensitive crops. A copy of that technical analysis is attached
10 hereto as Exhibit "E."

11 44. Another impact of the Project within JID is reduction of soil permeability caused
Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 by sodium imbalance (measured as sodium absorption ratio, or "SAR"). The EIR did not analyze
13 the Project's effect on SAR, but most of the SAR values for individual MPG wells are high
14 enough to cause significant to severe problems with soil structure, infiltration, and permeability.
O SAJYJO MET aUI UDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS 15 45. The EIR's failure to study these impacts to JID also renders its project description
16 misleading, shifting, and inaccurate. CEQA requires an accurate description of the Project,
17| including its "technical, economic, and environmental characteristics." (Guidelines, § 15124.) §
18 The EIR's description of the Project mischaracterizes the Project by, among other things, stating
19 that "[i]mplementation of the Proposed Action would not interfere with Reclamation's
HEVII CALIWIIV 20 contractual obligations to other water rights' holders within the Mendota Pool area." (EIR, p.
21 15.) The analysis prepared by P&P demonstrates that the Project will interfere with USBR's
22 contractual obligations to deliver high-quality water to JID.
23 46. The EIR short-cuts CEQA in that it conveniently ignores areas that will suffer
24 significant environmental impacts from the Project including the area within Petitioner's
25| boundaries and fails to describe or analyze any of these impacts to JID and is thus fatally
26 inadequate under CEQA. Certifying the EIR and approving the Project was a prejudicial abuse
27 of discretion because it artificially narrowed its consideration of impacts by excluding JID from
28 the study area. Respondent therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and its

I| 13323-71\00157153.004 10
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

actions are not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings are not supported by
2 substantial evidence.

3 Failure to Properly Describe the Environmental Setting or Baseline

47. An EIR must include a description of the environmental setting of the Project, or
5| "baseline," against which potential impacts are compared to determine whether they are
6 significant. (Guidelines, § 15125(a); Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line
Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447.) Proper characterization of the baseline is
8 essential to proper characterization and evaluation of the impacts of the Project. (Save Our
9 Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 119.)
10 48.

Young Wooldridge, LLP 49. The EIR fails to adequately describe the baseline for the Project in several ways,
11 including but not limited to the following:
12 As described above, JID is part of the environmental setting of the Project, due to

The Law Offices ( LUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION: 13 the major impacts the Project will have in JID. The EIR contains no discussion of baseline
14  conditions within JID, including without limitation its surface water and groundwater quality, its
15 cropped acreage and irrigation of sensitive crops, its soil characteristics, and other relevant
16 conditions within JID. Failure to describe and analyze impacts to part

18 V. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1216.) of the environmental

17 setting outside the "project area" is a violation of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control

50.

TI GILIWTT The EIR fails to consider, as part of the baseline, significant regulatory changes
20 that have been approved or are pending approval, including without limitation the changes to the
21 Water Quality Control Plan for the Tulare Lake Basin as part of the CV-SALTS initiative and
22 the changes to the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan, both of which will materially impact
23 the quantity or quality of surface water inputs to Mendota Pool. CEQA specifically requires an
24 EIR to address "any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable ... water quality
25 control plans." (Guidelines, § 15125(d).)

26 51. For its analysis of surface water quality under CEQA, the EIR compares the
271 potential impacts of the Project with conditions that are being caused by the previously approved
28 exchange agreements, effectively comparing the Project with itself and concealing its impacts.

II 13323-71\00157153.004 11
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

This is not the correct baseline, because as of the date of the NOP the exchange was set to cease
upon expiration of MPG's exchange agreements with Reclamation. The Project provides for
further exchange agreements that would continue the exchange for 20 additional years. The EIR
avoids considering the impacts of the Project by assuming a baseline of continued exchange.

52. The EIR attempts to justify its assumption of continued pumping by asserting that
groundwater pump-ins by MPG to support continued irrigation, reactivation of fallowed
farmland, and continued conversion from row crops to permanent crops on MPG lands will
8 continue whether the Project is approved or not. The EIR's "no action" alternative assumes over
9 33,000 acre-feet per year would be pumped by MPG in the absence of the Project, despite the
10 fact that the highest actual level of pumping for adjacent overlying use historically was
11 approximately 15,000 acre-feet per year. The existing conditions described in the baseline "shall
SNOLIVHOdNOO TVNOISSIHOUd INIAL Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 not include hypothetical conditions, such as those that might be allowed, but have never actually
13| occurred, under existing permits or plans, as the baseline." (Guidelines, § 15125(a)(3).)
14 53. This assumption also does not take into account other factors that would reduce
15 those pump-ins, such as the implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act O SaDyJo METOUL 16 (*SGMA"). Both the Delta-Mendota and Westside Subbasins have been designated by the
17 Department of Water Resources as critically overdrafted, and compliance with SGMA should be
18 expected to require pumpers to reduce, rather than increase, groundwater pumping. The baseline
19 not only assumes continued irrigation of existing lands but reactivation of fallowed lands and
LEVII CELINFI V 20 permanent crop conversions, which is patently unreasonable to expect under SGMA. (See
21 Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40
22 Cal.4th 412, 432 [future water supplies must bear a likelihood of proving available; speculative
23 sources and unrealistic allocations are insufficient bases for decision making under CEQA].)
24 Westlands' own Groundwater Sustainability Plan states that it intends to "allocate and manage
25 groundwater pumping among water users to avoid undesirable results." Comments submitted by
26 CDFW urged Westlands to approve the Project only in coordination with the appropriate
27 Groundwater Sustainability Agencies to ensure compatibility with their Groundwater
28 Sustainability Plans.

Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief I|13323-71\00157153.004 12

54. The EIR fails to completely and accurately describe a correct baseline against
2 which to identify and assess the impacts of the Project. Therefore, certifying the EIR and
3 approving a the Project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Respondent therefore failed to
4 proceed in a manner required by law, and its actions are not supported by adequate findings, and
5| its actions and findings are not supported by substantial evidence.
6 Failure to Disclose Analytic Route and Use of Incoherent and Inadequate Modeling and
Analysis

55. An EIR is intended to be an informational document, "prepared with a sufficient
9 degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to make
10 decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." (Guidelines, §
11 15151.)

O SOOyJO METOUI 1 QELIWITY LITY PARTNERSHIP INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 56. An EIR is fatally deficient if it "omits material necessary to informed
13 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6
14 Cal.5th 502, 515 l"County of Fresno"].) "[T]here must be a disclosure of the *analytic route the
15 •..

16 agency traveled from evidence to action.™" (Id. at p. 513.)

57. The EIR should be sufficient "to enable those who did not participate in its
17| preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed
18 project." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47
19 Cal.3d 376, 405 ["Laurel Heights"].) The EIR fails to comply with the informational
20 requirements of CEQA, including the principles articulated Laurel Heights and County of
21 Fresno, for several reasons including those alleged below.
22 58. In response to JID's comments, the EIR asserts, based on mixing models prepared
23 by its consultants, that salinity impacts of the Project will not exceed the threshold of significance
24 of 450 mg/L TDS. (EIR, p. 562.) However, actual data in the EIR shows that exceedances do
25 in fact occur during MPG pumping under the current exchanges. (E.g., EIR, p. 191.) This
26 conflict between the models and the data are not addressed in the EIR, nor does the EIR explain
27| how, unlike past groundwater discharges into the Pool by the MPG, Project groundwater
28 discharges will not cause exceedances at JID's intake. In response to JID's comments, as an

113323-71\00157153.004 13
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

excuse for the EIR's failure to study direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts within Petitioner's
2 boundaries, the EIR advances for the first time a theory that such exceedances were mostly
3 caused by about eleven unidentified groundwater dischargers downstream of Project wells.
4| However, Respondent failed to conduct an adequate investigation of such alleged dischargers,
5 the EIR's assumptions about those discharges are not supported by substantial evidence and are
6 contrary to the facts, and the actual data indicates that Project wells have been the exclusive or
7 near exclusive cause of the water quality exceedances. These discrepancies too are not
8 sufficiently explained in the EIR.

59. The models assume instantaneous and complete mixing of surface water inputs to
10 Mendota Pool, despite the fact water has been observed to blend poorly or stagnate near the
11 terminus of the DMC, a fact which has been recognized in orders of the State Water Resources
INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 Control Board. This results in a salinity gradient in Mendota Pool and Fresno Slough and
13| different salinity impacts in the northern and southern portions of the pool. Analysis by P&P
14 demonstrates that the models produce results inconsistent with available data in years for which

TO SaOgJO ME'T 3UL 15 the models were not validated.
16 60. But the EIR also makes arguments inconsistent with its modeling assumptions.
17 For instance, the response to JID's comments argues that "MPG water [is] captured and removed
18 from the Fresno Slough by these entities that lie between the MPG and James." (EIR, p. 568.)
LLINEVTI CELLIKITY 19 This assumes a "last in, first out" model of little to no mixing, which assumption is not supported
20| by substantial evidence.

21 61. The EIR also fails to disclose the groundwater salinity used to validate and predict
22 impacts with the models. Analysis by EKI indicates that current MPG groundwater salinity was
23 estimated at 880 mg/L TDS for purposes of the model. However, based on data in the EIR, EKI
24 estimates that the model assumes a lower future MPG groundwater salinity of approximately 660
25 mg/L TDS for the next 20 years. No explanation is given in the EIR for why future TDS
26| concentrations are expected to be lower than current TDS concentrations in groundwater pumped
27 to the Mendota Pool.

28 62. The models are also inadequate because, as noted by DWR in its comments, the

[13323-71\00157153.004 14
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

TDS data used to validate the models did not include the 2013-2014 drought, which is particularly
2 prejudicial given the EIR's acknowledgment that future droughts are increasingly likely due to
3 climate change.

4 63. The EIR is not an adequate informational document nor are its conclusions
5| supported by substantial evidence, because among other flaws its models make unclear,
unjustified, unstated, confusing, and inconsistent assumptions, Certification of the EIR and
approval of the Project was therefore a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a failure to proceed in a
8 manner required by law, and unsupported by adequate findings or substantial evidence.
Failure to Address Short and Medium Term Impacts

10 64. CEQA requires consideration of both short term and long term impacts.
11 (Guidelines, § 15126.2(a); Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Const. Auth.
Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 454-55.) CEQA requires "a good faith effort at full disclosure" of those
13 impacts. (Guidelines, § 15151; see San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center V. County of Merced
14 (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 660.) The EIR prejudicially fails to study the Project's direct,

O SaJyJo MET aUI CLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION: 15| indirect, and cumulative impacts as required by CEQA for several reasons including the
16 following.

17 65. The EIR assumes the volume of water pumped as part of the exchange program
18 will remain constant at 21,053 acre-feet per year on average throughout the 20-year project life
19 of the Project, which is in conflict with the Project's description of up to over 26,000 AF of
IT GLINITV 20 | pumping in any given year. It gives no justification for that assumption, and that assumption
21 does not reflect the history of exchanges by MPG under the previous programs and fails to
22 capture or assess significant impacts and the full extent of the Project's adverse environmental
23 impacts. Actual exchange pumping by MPG varies dramatically from year to year, with

24 generally higher amounts in dry years. (Exh. D, p. 12.)
25 66. In dry years, the amount of water in Mendota Pool from the DMC is reduced and
26 pumping by MPG is increased (see, e.g., EIR, Table 17). This leads to significant increased
27 salinity as groundwater makes up a larger portion of the water in the pool. According to EKI's
28| analysis, if the EIR did not assume constant pumping below the allowable Project limit it would

|/13323-71\00157153.004 15
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

show projected exceedances of the thresholds of significance, particularly in dry years, thus

2 requiring feasible mitigation as discussed below.

67. In addition to the surface water quality impacts concealed by the EIR's
assumptions, short periods of increased transfer pumping and reduced DMC supplies lead to the
5 introduction of significant quantities of salt into the district. As an example, in just the five-
6 month period from May to September 2014, increased salinity at the P-Booster Station resulted
in 2,903 tons more salt than if DMC water had been received unaltered. That additional salt load
8 has adverse effects on soil permeability, and if it can be successfully leached from the root zone
9 it then has adverse impacts to groundwater salinity.

10 68. The EIR's faulty analysis ignores the greatest impacts of the Project on crop yields
11 and soil characteristics in JID, which will occur in dry years when the Project discharges the
SNOLLVIOdNOD TVNOISSAIONJ ONIANIDNI dIHSHINLAVA ALINEVII CALIWIT Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 poorest quality and greatest amounts of groundwater in excess of the hypothetical averages
13 employed by the EIR. The EIR's flawed impact assessment, e.g., the use of 20-year long-term
14 averages, effectively ignores short- and medium-term periods existing in the real world when the
JO SOJYJO MET aU 15 Project will result in water quality exceedances and significant adverse effects.
16 69. Because the EIR does not consider the short and medium term impacts of the
17 Project, certification of the EIR and approval of the Project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
18 a failure to proceed in a manner required by law, and unsupported by adequate findings or
19 substantial evidence.

20 Failure to Address Cumulative Impacts

21 70. An EIR is required to "discuss the cumulative effect on the environment of the
22 subject project in conjunction with other closely related past, present and reasonably foreseeable
23 probable future projects." (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus
24 (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 739; Guidelines, §§ 15063(b)(1); 15355.) This is a critical part of
25 CEQA analysis. (Schoen v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
26 556, 572.)
27 71. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively
28 significant projects taking place over a period of time. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control

13323-71\00157153.004 16
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214-15; Guidelines, § 15355(b).) The
2 impacts of a project can "appear insignificant when considered individually, but assume
3| threatening dimensions when considered collectively with other sources with which they
interact." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 98, 114; see also Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1019.)

72. The EIR does not evaluate the cumulative impacts of the Project, including
8 without limitation the effects of MPG pumping along with other pump-ins to Mendota Pool and
Fresno Slough and other reductions in DMC supplies such as those to be brought about by the
10 updated Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan, climate change, and SGMA. These impacts
11 include fallowing of prime farmland, reduced crop yields, and other adverse environmental

SIONAL CORPORATIONS 12| impacts within JID.

73. In response to Petitioner's comments raising this issue, the EIR asserts that the
14 Project is a "minor contributor to southward flowing surface water toward [JID]," relative to

1O saoyJo MET OUI Young Wooldridge, LLP 13

15 "many other non-Federal ongoing pump-in and exchange programs." (EIR, p. 565.) However,
16 the EIR provides no data about the quantity or quality of other pump-ins, arguing that "no
17 information is available." (Ibid.)
18 74. The EIR admits that MPG pumping under the existing programs constitutes 20-
19 30% of all pump-ins to Mendota Pool in a normal year. (EIR, p. 226.) Such a proportion is not
II CELIWTIV 20 "minor." Furthermore, this form of argument is the "ratio theory" rejected by Kings County
21 Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 721. The EIR is required to
22 consider the collective effect of all the pump-ins rather than focus solely on the contribution of
23 the individual Project.
24 75. Steve Stadler, JID's General Manager, contacted Reclamation to ask what other
25 pump-in and exchange programs the EIR refers to. Of the ten pumpers identified, Mr. Stadler
26 was able to quickly determine that six either do not discharge into Mendota Pool or do so in a
27| way that their discharge does not enter Fresno Slough. Several others were very small quantities
28 or very high quality. Information on quantity of the discharges was available for nine of the ten.

13323-71\00157153.004 17
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

1 This demonstrates that Westlands did not do even a minimally adequate investigation as required
2 by CEQA.
3 76. CDFW noted in its comments that the EIR also fails to consider the cumulative
4 impact of these other programs, including programs approved by Reclamation, on subsidence
5 beneath Mendota Dam.

6 77. Because the EIR does not properly analyze the cumulative impact of the Project,
7 and because Westlands did not perform the reasonable investigation of such impacts required by
CEQA, certification of the EIR and approval of the Project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
a failure to proceed in a manner required by law, and unsupported by adequate findings or
10 substantial evidence.

11 Failure to Conduct Anti-Degradation Analysis

HIP INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 78. CEQA requires that the lead agency coordinate the various environmental review
13 required for the Project and produce an EIR sufficient for responsible agencies to rely on when
14| issuing necessary approvals. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2
TO SaDYO METaUI 15 Cal.5th 918, 936; Pub. Resources Code, § 21003(a); Guidelines, § 15063(g).)
16 79. The Project will require a permit under the National Pollution Discharge
17 Elimination System ("NPDES"), issued by the Regional Water Quality Control Board. In order
18 to issue that permit, the board will need to make findings under the antidegradation policy
Sunox 19| ("ADP").

20 80. In 1968, the State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") adopted an ADP
21 in response to a directive from the Department of the Interior calling for adoption of state
22 antidegradation policies to protect high quality surface and ground waters. The ADP is contained
23 in SWRCB Resolution No. 68-16.

24 81. The ADP states that "the quality of some of the waters of the State is higher than
25 that established by the adopted policies and it is the intent and purpose of this Board that such
26 higher quality shall be maintained to the maximum extent possible consistent with the declaration
27 of the Legislature."
28 82, Before the Regional Water Quality Control Board authorizes any discharge of

113323-71\00157153.004 18
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

waste into high-quality waters, the ADP requires it to find that "any change [in water quality]
2 will be consistent with maximum benefit to the people of the State, will not unreasonably affect
3| present and anticipated beneficial use of such water and will not result in water quality less than
4 that prescribed in the policies." Second, it must find that the discharge "will be required to meet
5 waste discharge requirements which will result in the best practicable treatment or control of the
6 discharge necessary to assure that (a) a pollution or nuisance will not occur and (b) the highest
7 water quality consistent with maximum benefit to the people of the State will be maintained."
8 83. Contrary to the holding of Banning Ranch, the EIR contains no analysis to support
to findings required by the ADP. Therefore, certification of the EIR and approval of the Project

LUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Youn g Wooldridge, LLP 10 was a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a failure to a proceed in a manner required by law, and
11 unsupported by adequate findings or substantial evidence.
12 Failure to Consider Mitigation and Alternatives

13 84.

0 Sadyyo MeTayL In an EIR, each feasible means of mitigating the impacts of the project "should be
14 discussed and the basis for selecting a particular measure should be identified." (Guidelines, §
15 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) It must also consider "a range of reasonable alternatives to the project
16 which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or
17 substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." (Guidelines, § 15126.6.)
18 85.

3 A LIMITED LLA Because, as discussed above, the EIR does not adequately assess the baseline and
19 impacts of the Project, it does not consider appropriate mitigation of the impacts it does not
20 describe. Also, because the EIR conceals and underestimates many of the Project's impacts, its
21 analysis of possible mitigation is inadequate. Analysis of appropriate mitigation and alternatives
22 requires an accurate understanding of the impacts to be avoided.
23 86.

24 the water. Specifically, the EIR "must present a viable solution that can effectively replace
that could be lost by" other users, including JID, and ensure "the ability to use water
25 in substantially the same manner that they were accustomed to doing if the Project had not
26 existed." (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116-17.)
27 87. The EIR should have considered a mitigation measure or alternative

28 recommended by Petitioner in its comments: for example, allow the Project's exchange program,

13323-71\00157153.004 19
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

but place constraints on discharges in dry years such that water quality at the P-Booster Station
2 does not exceed applicable water quality standards or criteria.

88. Additionally, the EIR incorporates "design constraints" into the project
description instead of treating them as mitigation measures. As a result, it does not consider
other, potentially better, mitigation measures, such as constraints based on degree of degradation
6 rather than the volume of water pumped. "[C]ompressing the analysis of impacts and mitigation
measures into single issue disregards the requirements of CEQA." (Lotus V. Department of
Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 656.)

89. As pointed out by CDFW in its comments, the design constraints effectively defer
10 mitigation by providing that, in the event of exceedances, Reclamation and MPG "will coordinate
11 with other users around the Mendota Pool to determine the cause of the exceedance and any
PARTNERSHIP INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS Young Wooldridge, LLP 12 applicable remedial actions needed." (EIR, pp.177-78.) Such deferral is not in compliance with
13 CEQA. (Oakland Heritage Alliance v. City of Oakland (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 884, 906.)
14 90. Because the EIR does not consider feasible mitigation for impacts of the Project

TO SaOYJO MET OY 15 to JID, and because it does not consider an appropriate range of alternatives, certification of the
16 EIR and approval a of the Project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a failure to proceed in a
17| manner required by law, and unsupported by adequate findings or substantial evidence.
18 Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments

19 91. CEQA requires the lead agency to provide "good faith, reasoned analysis in
VTI QULINII 20 response" to comments on the DEIR, and "[c]onclusory statements unsupported by factual
21 information will not suffice" for that purpose. (Guidelines, § 15088(c).)

22 92. The responses to comments in the EIR do not respond adequately to the concerns
23 raised. They rely on conclusory statements unsupported by evidence,

24 93. One example of the conclusory nature of the responses to comments is the
25 response to Petitioner's comment that analysis under the ADP is necessary to allow the Regional
26 Water Quality Control Board to issue a NPDES permit. In response, the EIR simply asserts that
27 "those permitting and regulatory processes would occur following adoption of a project or
28 program by the lead agency." (EIR, p. 578.) However, the point of the comment was that it is

13323-71\00157153.004 20
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Declaratory And Injunctive Relief

contrary to CEQA to defer that analysis a to a later date. Thus, the response does not actually
2 engage with the substance of the comment.

3 94. Because the EIR does not adequately respond to comments on the DEIR,
4 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion, a failure
5 to proceed a in a manner required by law, and unsupported by adequate findings or substantial
6 evidence.

ATTORNEYS' FEES

95. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees from Respondent and Real Parties
9 in Interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because this action will, among
10 other things, confer a significant benefit on the general public and a large class of persons, and

SNOLLVHOdHOD 5 11 the necessity and burden of private enforcement makes an award of fees appropriate.
12 DECLARATORY RELIEF

TO SaDYO METaUL LUDING PROFESSION Young Wooldridge, 13 96. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and
14 Respondent concerning their respective rights and duties in that Petitioner contends Respondent
15 has violated CEQA with respect to the Project, whereas Respondent disputes these contentions
16 and contends that it has complied with CEQA with respect to the Project.
17 97. Petitioner desires a judicial determination and declaration that Respondent has not
18 complied with CEQA with respect to the Project. A judicial resolution of this controversy is
19 necessary and appropriate.
A LIMITED LI 20 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

21 98. Petitioner is informed and believes that Respondent and Real Parties in Interest
22 are threatening to carry out the Project in the near future and that the Project will irreparably
23 harm the environment by, among other things, adversely affecting surface and groundwater
24 quality, crop yields, and soils within Petitioner's boundaries.
25 99. If Respondent and Real Parties in Interest implement the Project, large amounts
26 of additional salt will be brought into Petitioner's irrigation systems and applied to the lands

Dear Mr. Birmingham:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that the James Irrigation District intends to commence an action pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by filing a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") in the Superior Court of Fresno County under the California
Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code division 13 ("CEQA"), against Westlands Water District ("Westlands") as the CEQA lead agency with respect to its approval and/or adoption of a final Environmental Impact Statement / Environmental Impact Report ("EIS/EIR") (SCH#2013041028) and approval of project known as the Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchange Program ("Project") on January 21, 2020, including adoption of Resolution No. 101-20 and Resolution No. 102-20, all in violation of CEQA. The challenged actions are also described in a Notice of Determination filed with the Fresno County Clerk by Westlands on January 23, 2020.
The Petition will allege, among other things, that Westlands failed to properly follow the procedures and requirements of CEQA with respect to the Project in several ways including, but not limited to: failure to analyze impacts to James Irrigation District, failure to properly describe the environmental setting or bascline, failure to disclose the analytic route and use of incoherent and inadequate modeling and analysis, failure to address short and medium term impacts, failure to address cumulative impacts, failure to conduct analysis under California's
Anti-Degradation Policy, failure to consider appropriate mitigation and alternatives, and failure
to adequately respond to comments.

Generally speaking, the Petition will seek the following, as well as other relief: (1) a writ of mandate to void and set aside all Project approvals, the EIS/EIR, findings, and mitigation

Notice of Determination €102010000024
Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchange Program

Notice of Determination (NOD) Attachment A • Project Description:

The Mendota Pool Group (MPG) extends a previously approved 10-Year Exchange Program,
Settlement Agreements, and subsequent 3-year and 1-year extensions (hereafter referred to as
the Existing Exchange Agreements) for a perlod of 20 additional a years. The 20-Year Exchange
Program (Project) would allow MPG farmers in the Westlands Water District (Westlands) to supplement their Central Valley Project (CVP) water deliveries and conservation practices with affordable, reliable, and good quality water in order to maintain continued cultivation bf approximately 42,316 acres of historically irrigated lands. MPG irrigated lands are located in Westlands' San Luis Canal (SLC) service area. The U.S, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) admlnisters the CVP and would issue a series of
annual or multi-year exchange agreements to facilitate the Project. The water exchange allows
MPG farmers to deliver groundwater of sultable quality to Mendota Pool in exchange for CVP ....*

Irrigation water delivered via the SLC for use on MPG-owned farms In Westlands.

Three alternatives were considered for analysis in the Joint Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR); a No Project Alternative, a Proposed Project,
and Alternative 2. Reclamation and Westlands as the Lead Agencies both certified the EIS/ER
and approved Alternative 2, which is hereafter referred to as the Approved Project.

Approved Project:
The Approved Project cons|sts of the following components:

a. CVP Water Transfer: The Aproved Project would allow MPG to pump up to 26,316 acre- feet (AF) of water per year (AFY) of non-CVP groundwater into the Mendota Pool and Fresno Slough, and exchange it contractually with Reclamation for up to 25,0001 AFY of CVP water from the Delta-Mendota Canal (DMC) at Check 13 at O'Neal Forebay of the San Luis Reservoir. The Approved Project would allow for continued water exchange; however, MPG would be limited to pumping a maximum of 400,000 AF of groundwater for exchange over the 20-year period. This exchanged water would be delivered to land owned by MPG members In Westlands. Reclamation would Issue a series of annual or multi-year excharge agreements over the 20-year period. The amount of waler exchanged each year would vary of based on several factors, including rainfall, CVP water availability and ground and surface water monitoring data reflecting the effects of MPG pumping. The groundwater pumping program would be adaptively managed to avoid or substantially lessen environmental impacts lo less-than-significant levels, Adjustments will be made to the pumping program the monitoring program indicates that actions need to be taken to prevent significant impacts, such as well drawdown, subsidence, or water quality degradation in the Mondota Pool.

b. Adiacent Overlying Use: In addition to water exchanged with Reclamation through the CVP, the program would continue to aulhorize the MPG to pump up to an additional 12,000 AFY of groundwater from MPG wells to irrigate overlying lands and lands adjacent to the Mendota Pool owned and operated by MPG members. This provision is referred is to in the Existing

The Approved Project would continue a constraint of the Existing Exchange Agreements that requires 5 percent of the groundwaler pumped into the Mendola Pool be ratained in the Pool to account for conveyance water loss.

Mondota Pool Group 20 Year Exchange Program
Exchange Agreements as "adjacent use". Although this water would be pumped from MPG wells located in Farmers Water District (FWD) and from other non-districted areas around the Mendota Pool, all water pumped in FWD for adjacent use must be used within FWD to allow for groundwater recharge within this area. If pumping for adjacent use exceeds 12,000 AFY, transfer pumping (as discussed above) must be reduced by a corresponding
amount,

C. Moniloring Program, Design Constraints and Adaptive Management: The Approved Project includes continued implementation of the Monitoring Program, design constraints, and an adaptive management approach established by the 1998 Final EIR, 2004 Final EIS and Settlement Agreements, with revisions, and may also include possible new actlons consistent with SGMA and local future GSPs. These provisions are designed to continualy improve the groundwater oumping program and avold or substantially lessen associated environmental impacts.

i. Monitoring Program The data and results of the monitoring program would continue to be summarized In an annual report prepared by the MPG, the Exchange Contractors, and Wonderful Orchards, The results of the monitoring
program would inform the design of the subsequent year's pumping program. Monitoring data would be provided to Reclamation at the specified frequency for each parameler to verify pumping and monitoring plan Implementation, In addition, monitoring data would also be provided to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Wildlife, among others, if requested, at the same intervals the data is provided to Reclamation. The Monitoring Program would continue to involve the participation of MPG and voluntary partic|pation of several entities around the Mendota Pool, Including the Exchange Contractors, Wonderful Orchards, San Luis Delta Mendota Water Authority, the City of Mendota, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the DWR, and others.

if. Design Constraints - Design constraints are management strategies inherent in the groundwater pumping program that were started under the Existing Exchange Agreements in 2001. Design constraints from these agreements would be continued, with modifications, under the Approved Project. The design constraints apply to the annual pumping programs, pumping from the deep and shallow zones and to triggers based on the results of the annual monitoting program. Design constraints are established to monitor and regulate surfhce water rights and quality, groundwater pumping and quality, and subsidence.

lil. Adaptive Management • Under the Approved Project, the adaptive management program would be continued with improvements that better avoid or substantially reduce potential adverse effects to water quality in the Mendota Pool. Exchange Agreements with Reclamation would be issued either on an annual or multi-year basis subject to annual review and concurrence of the Exchange Contractors and Wonderful Orchards. Further, similar to  the process under the Existing Exchange Agreements, pumping program would be developed by MPG on an annual basis and revlewed by the Exchange Contractors, Wonderful Orchards, and Reclamation to allow for year-lo-year variations in hydrologic conditions. Each exchange agreement under the Approved Project would be based on consideration of several factors, including the design constraints and the results of 1he monthly TDS data and the annual reporting program. As with the Existing Exchange Agreements, the annual pumping program negoliated with Reclamalion,

Pagell 2

Notice of Determination E 2ozolo000024
Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchauge Program
Westlands, and other stakeholders at the beginning of each Irrigation season (March 1st) would take Into consideration the monitoring results of previous exchange years and design that specific year's exchange program based on those
results.

d. Groundwater Recharge: The approved Project would include a groundwater recharge component nat currently provided for in the existing Exchange Agreements. The purpose of the groundwater recharge component is to replenish the San Joaquin Groundwater Basin during periods when surplus cVP water or flood flows are avallable. The groundwater recharge component is intended to offset potentlal adverse effects of groundwater pumped under the Exchange Agreements,
The groundwater recharge component could include use of existing recharge basins on the New Columbia Ranch, Potentlal water sources available for groundwater recharge would include flood flows from the Kings River, Section 215 surplus CVP water for South of Deita Contractors (water from San Luis Reservoir), Section 215 water for Friant Contractors, and
surplus San Joaquin River restoration flows which would be conveyed by existing diversions on the New Columbia Ranch. These diversions may include the Columbia Canal, Ridge Ditch, Central Canal, or Lone Willow Slough. Groundwater recharge could also include yse of an existing recharge canal on land owned by Terra Linda Farms located west of the
Fresno Slough whenever supplemental water or flood flows are available, Water sources potentially avallable for groundwater recharge at this location include Section 215 surplus CVP water, flood flows from the Kings River, and surplus San Joaquin River Restoration Flows. However, the analysls conservatively assumes only flood flows from the Kings River would be available for proposed recharge actions. Based on a review of flood flow dala, flood flows from the Kings River are predicted to be available for recharge at the Terra Linda
Recharge Canal in up to eight years of the 20-year exchange period and up to four years at the existing four New Columbia Ranch (NCR) Recharge Ponds, The total potential additdnal recharge potential above existing levels and attribulable to MPG during the 20-year life of the Approved Project is conservatively estimated to be 23,169 AF. Groundwater recharge from the Terra Linda Recharge Canal is estimated to be 4,127 AF over the 20-year perjod, while MPG contributions to the existing four NCR Recharge Ponds s estimated to be 19,042
AF.
MPG would also construct and operate a groundwater recharge basin adjacent the Terra Linda Farms Recharge Canal, The proposed recharge basin, referred to as the River Rahch Recharge Basin, would replenish underlying local groundwater aquifers. This analysis assumes that flood flows from the Kings River would also be the source of water for River Ranch Recharge Basin and that flows would be available for the same elght years (over the 20-year perlod) that they're available 1o the Terra Linda Farms Recharge Canal under the ... . .1
Approved Project. By providing an additional recharge facility, this alternative would offset drawdown of Idcal ...
groundwater aquifers to a greater extent than under the Approved Project and, In doing so, reduce the potential for undesirable effects such as groundwater level declines and migration of the naturally-occurring saline groundwater front west of the Fresno Slough. The River Ranch Recharge Basin under this alternative would function solely for the purpose of recharging the local groundwaler aquifer and would not be used as a water bank (€.g., Meyer's Water Bank) whereln water is contractually recharged, banked and extracted for later use. Under this allernative, the MPG would maximize recharge with the goal of achieving over 43,000 AF of recharge over the 20-year exchange perlod by constructing the River Ranch Recharge Basin, activating the Terra Linda Farm Recharge Canal, and

Subject: Technical Review of Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchange Program
Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement
(EKI B90167.00)

Dear Mr. Stadler:

This technical review summarizes EKI Environment & Water, Inc.'s ("EKI's") review of the Final
Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIS/EIR") for the Mendota Pool
Group ("MPG")+ 20-Year Exchange Program ("Proposed Action"). The Final EIS/EIR was prepared jointly
by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") and Westlands
Water District ("Westlands") in October 2019.

PROPOSED ACTION

The Proposed Action would allow Reclamation to issue a series of agreements over a period of 20 years
that authorize the exchange of up to 25,000 acre-feet per year ("AFY") of surface water for groundwater
pumped by MPG. Under the Proposed Action, Central Valley Project ("CVP") water, which ordinarily would
be delivered to the Mendota Pool ("Pool") through Check 21 on the Delta-Mendota Canal ("DMC"), would
instead be diverted through the San Luis Canal to MPG farms on the west side of California's Central Valley
within Westlands.2 In exchange, MPG would discharge an equivalent amount of groundwater plus a
5 percent "leave-in" quantity of native groundwater to the Mendota Pool up to a maximum volume of
26,316 AFY. 3 The total volume of groundwater that could be added to the Pool in exchange for CVP surface
water would be capped at 421,053 AF, which equates to an annual pumping average of 21,053 AFY over

According to the Final EIS/EIR, MPG was formed in 1989 with the overall purpose of providing an organization and
framework to coordinate the exchange of groundwater for CVP surface water that is diverted through Check 13 on
the DMC to the San Luis Canal and subsequently delivered to farms. MPG has eleven formal members consisting of:
(1) Terra Linda Farms, (2) Vista Verde Farms, (3) Coelho West, (4) Meyers Farming Company, (5) Casaca Vineyards,
(6) Daddy's Pride Farming, (7) Solo Mio Farms, (8) Baker Farming Company, (9) Friedenbach/Turmon Farms (Panoche
Creek Trust), (10) Frank A. Logoluso Farms, and (11) M. Britz TIC. In addition, MPG coordinates Mr. Don Peracchi's
exchange pumping program. See Final EIS/EIR. pp. 1-2 and p. 31.

the 20-year project life of the Proposed Action.4 a As a result of exchanges performed as part of the
Proposed Action, James Irrigation District and others downstream of the Pool would receive surface water
degraded by Proposed Action discharges.

The Proposed Action also authorizes MPG to pump an additional 12,000 AFY to Mendota Pool for adjacent
overlying use.5 Thus, the not-to-exceed volume of MPG groundwater that could be pumped to the Pool
during given year is 38,316 AFY, which includes up to 26,316 AFY for exchange and the remainder for
adjacent overlying use.

Adjacent overlying use means groundwater that is pumped by is MPG into Mendota Pool and conveyed to nearby lands where it is used for irrigation.' "Transfer pumping"8 or "exchange pumping"9 pertains to
groundwater that is added to Mendota Pool to replace CVP surface water that is diverted by MPG.

TECHNICAL REVIEW

Westlands relies on predictions of its surface water mixing models to conclude impacts to surface water
quality would be less than significant for the Proposed Action.10 However, these model predictions are
contradicted by monitoring results that confirm salinity impacts to surface water in Fresno Slough11 are
above the threshold of significance of 450 milligrams per liter ("mg/L") established for the Proposed Action.12 Westlands attempts to resolve this discrepancy by asserting incremental salt loads introduced
by non-MPG operations are the cause of the exceedances as opposed to MPG groundwater transfer
pumping.

No factual support for this assertion is provided in the Final EIS/EIR because Westlands admits "no
information is available on the quality or quantity of water delivered to, conveyed through, or diverted from the Fresno Slough by these non-MPG pumpers."13 Moreover, speculation about other sources is not warranted because available data demonstrate adverse impacts to water quality in Fresno Slough are due

to MPG groundwater transfer pumping almost exclusively. The data also show impacts will persist and
possibly worsen if transfer pumping is authorized for twenty more years under the Proposed Action.

Surface Water Budget Models Do Not Accurately Predict Salinity Trends

The Mendota Pool is a reservoir created a by the Mendota Dam at the confluence of the San Joaquin River
and the DMC. Surface water in the Pool south of the Firebaugh Intake Canal flows south past the Mendota
Wildlife Area ("MWA") and James Irrigation District Booster Plant to the City of Tranquility. 14 This almost
15-mile long reach of the Pool between the Firebaugh Intake Canal and City of Tranquility is referred to
as the Fresno Slough. 15

Two surface water budget models have been developed for purposes of evaluating the potential impacts
of the Proposed Action, one for the Fresno Slough and one for the San Joaquin River branch of the
Mendota Pool. The Final EIS/EIR refers to these models as the Surface Water Mixing Models. 16 The models
are used primarily to estimate salinity as total dissolved solids ("TDS") but also have been employed to
predict boron17 and selenium18 concentrations.

Based on our review, the models do not accurately estimate concentrations of TDS and other chemicals
of concern ("COCs") in Fresno Slough because, among other flaws, the models are based on instantaneous and complete mixing of surface water.19 Such mixing would result in uniform COC concentrations in
water,20 which does not occur in Fresno Slough.

Water introduced to Mendota Pool tends to blend poorly or stagnate in the vicinity of the DMC. 21 As
result, a TDS concentration gradient exists in surface water along Fresno Slough. 22 In 2010, incomplete
mixing was demonstrated when recaptured flows from the San Joaquin River Restoration Program
("SJRRP") entered the Mendota Pool through the DMC and caused a spike in Pool salinity. The SJRRP flows

did not mix thoroughly with the low-salinity San Joaquin River and resulted in higher salinity water in Fresno Slough and the irrigation canal headworks.23
Slow movement of water in Fresno Slough leads to different water quality impacts at the north end of
Mendota Pool compared to the south end of the Pool.24 LSCE recognizes that modeling of surface water
within Mendota Pool must account for variations in salinity concentrations. LSCE states:

Since factors affecting salinity concentrations in the northern portion of the Pool differ significantly from factors affecting salinity near the MWA, two surface water budget
models were developed, one for the northern branch of the Pool to evaluate salinity
concentrations at the Mendota Dam and one for the southern branch of the Pool to
evaluate salinity at the MWA. 25

Despite the existence of COC concentration gradients attributable to incomplete mixing, Westlands
utilized overly simplistic and flawed surface water budget models to evaluate impacts to water quality by
the Proposed Action. The models assume rapid and complete mixing, which produces a uniform concentration for a given COC in each branch of the Mendota Pool. In contrast, incomplete mixing is divided into two stages with distinctive mixing characteristics. Mixing and dilution in the first stage are determined by the initial momentum and buoyancy of the discharge to the waterbody. The second stage
of mixing covers a more extensive area in which the effect of initial momentum and buoyancy is
diminished, and the discharge is mixed primarily by ambient turbulence. This second-stage mixing area
may extend for miles in large rivers or estuaries. 26 Under incomplete mixing situations, COC
concentrations are typically estimated using mixing zone computer models such as the CORMIX modeling
system. 27

The surface water budget models do not accurately predict COC concentration trends in Fresno Slough,
in part, because the models do not properly simulate the surface water flow regime within this branch of
Mendota Pool. As noted by Provost & Pritchard Consulting Group, Inc. ("Provost & Pritchard"), the surface
water budget models produce results that are inconsistent with actual TDS concentrations in years for
which the models were not validated.28 The complete mixing assumption of the models ignores the effects

of factors such as "daily variations of activities, Pool water flow currents, wind-driven wave effects,
dispersion, and advection."29

Consequently, the outputs of the surface water budget models are unreliable and cannot be used to
demonstrate that the Proposed Action's impacts to water quality or productivity of downstream irrigators
or habitats would be less than significant. The inaccuracy of the surface water budget models is illustrated
by comparing model-predicted annual average TDS concentrations at the MWA with actual annual
average TDS concentrations calculated from monthly grab samples collected at the MWA and analyzed
by MPG.30

Figure 1 compares the actual annual average TDS concentrations with the annual average TDS
concentrations for MWA predicted by the surface water budget model that was used in 200431 to evaluate
potential water quality impacts associated with the Mendota Pool 10-Year Exchange Agreements.

As shown on Figure 1, actual annual average TDS concentrations computed from monthly grab sample
analytical results are greater and display a faster rate of increase than the annual average TDS
concentrations predicted with the surface water budget model. The regression or trendline indicates
actual annual average TDS concentrations in surface water at the MWA are increasing with time. Salinity
data for the MWA contradict the model results that predict relatively stable TDS concentrations over time.

The coefficient of determination (R2) is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted
trendline. A R2 of 1 means the trendline can explain all the variation in the dependent variable. If R2 is If
close to zero, then the trendline can explain very little of the variation in the dependent variable. In
general, if a is R2 value is greater than 0.7, then the trendline is described as having strong predictive
capabilities, whereas a R2 value less than 0.5 indicates the trendline has weak predictive capabilities. The
R2 of the trendline on Figure 1 is 0.56, which indicates a linear relationship exists but the correlation
between the variables is not sufficient to accurately predict TDS concentrations with time. Nevertheless,
the data indicate that MPG's pumping of groundwater into the Mendota Pool is having potentially
significant/adverse effects on surface water quality. The upward trend of TDS concentrations at the MWA,
as well as the James Irrigation District Booster Plant, is verified by applying the Mann-Kendall test to data
compiled for these locations.

The Mann-Kendall test is a statistical test for linear trend, based on the idea that a lack of trend should
correspond to a time series plot fluctuating randomly about a constant mean level, with no visually
apparent upward or downward pattern. If an increasing trend really exists, the sample taken first from
any randomly selected pair of measurements should on average have a lower concentration than the

Salinity Exceedances Are Due Almost Exclusively to MPG Groundwater Transfer Pumping
Westlands acknowledges MGP transfer pumping has contributed to increased salinity in surface water at
MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant.33 As shown on Figure 2, between the years 2000 and
2016, TDS concentrations in surface water samples collected by MPG at the MWA and James Irrigation
District Booster Plant have risen approximately 20 mg/L annually.

The plots of monthly grab sample analytical results on Figure 2 also show TDS concentrations in surface
water samples obtained at the MWA and James Irrigation District Booster Plant are routinely greater than
450 mg/L. The Proposed Action establishes a threshold or design constraint that the average annual TDS concentration in surface water at the MWA shall not be greater than 450 mg/L.34 Westlands relies on continued implementation of existing design constraints to conclude the impact of the Proposed Action
to water quality in Fresno Slough will be less than significant.35 Yet, the annual average TDS concentrations
for MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant have been routinely above 450 mg/L since 2007
even with the design constraints, monitoring program, and adaptive management approach that are being
employed and would continue under the Proposed Action. 36

Westlands dismisses the ineffectiveness of the design constraints by asserting exceedances of the
450 mg/L threshold at the MWA are not associated with MPG transfer pumping but rather "periods of
low southerly flows from the San Joaquin River caused by reduced diversions, substantial non-MPG
pump-ins into the Fresno Slough and MWA portions of the Mendota Pool, migration of the saline front, and higher salinity drought influenced levels in the DMC." 37 Westlands claims "data demonstrate that
MPG inputs are not the major contributor to potential exceedances in salinity and TDS standards in the MWA and areas further south,"3& but these data are not provided in the Final EIS/EIR. Westlands simply
speculates if the data were available, they would indicate non-MPG pumping into Fresno Slough south of
MWA is causing the high concentrations of boron and other COCs in surface water at the James Irrigation
District Booster Plant. Westlands states:

However, data to characterize surface water flow patterns were not available to the MPG
for this southern portion of the Fresno Slough. Also, non-MPG pump-in water quality
data, MWA pumping patterns, etc., were not available, but likely significantly degrade
surface water quality observed at the James Irrigation District intake. Thus, it is
determined that MPG pumping has not, and would not under the Proposed Action and
Alternative 2, result in or substantially contribute to boron-related surface water quality
impacts at James Irrigation District. While the MPG is managing the salinity and boron
discharges into the Pool via this program, the MPG has no jurisdiction over non-MPG
discharges into the Pool, including those in the southern portion of the Pool in the MWA
area in proximity to the James Irrigation District P-Booster Plant intake. 39
A plot of annual average TDS concentrations for surface water at the MWA and James Irrigation District
Booster Plant (Figure 3) does not support Westlands' contention that water added to Fresno Slough by
intervening non-MPG entities is impairing water quality in the southernmost reach of the slough.

Instead, Figure 3 indicates annual average TDS concentrations for MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant are influenced greatly by the MPG groundwater transfer volume pumped into Fresno
Slough. In years where exchange pumping is curtailed (i.e., 2002 and 2010) or does not take place
(i.e., 2003 through 2006 and 2011), annual average TDS concentrations for MWA and the James Irrigation

District Booster Plant decrease and approach those for CVP water conveyed by the DMC to Mendota
Pool.41

The influence of the DMC on water quality is not surprising given the DMC is the dominant source of
surface water in Mendota Pool.42 Reclamation delivers on the order of 50,000 to 100,000 AFY of surface
water to Fresno Slough through the DMC43 compared to MPG groundwater transfer pumping volumes on
the order of 10,000 to 20,000 AFY (see Figure and Table 1).

Large volumes of CVP surface water delivered by the DMC improve water quality within Fresno Slough
because CVP surface water has TDS concentrations that are lower than those in groundwater pumped by
MPG into Mendota Pool. The higher salinity of MPG groundwater transfer volumes results in exceedances
of the TDS significance threshold of 450 mg/L.

The influence of CVP surface water is exhibited between 2015 and 2016 when the annual average TDS concentration for water in the DMC declined and corresponding drops in annual average TDS concentrations for water at MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant were observed (Figure 3)
when the MPG annual groundwater transfer pumping volume remained relatively constant.
TDS concentrations in surface water at MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant can be
explained by the MPG groundwater transfer pumping volume to Mendota Pool and salinity of CVP water
in the DMC since these variables or parameters describe the sources that control surface water quality in
Fresno Slough. Figure 4 displays the results of multivariate linear regression performed by EKI. Equations
were derived that predict annual average TDS concentrations in surface water at MWA and the James
Irrigation District Booster Plant using the MPG annual groundwater transfer pumping volume to Mendota
Pool and DMC annual average TDS concentration of CVP water at Check 21 as input parameters
(see Table 1).

Annual average TDS concentrations in surface water at MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster
Plant predicted by the multivariate equations are plotted against annual average TDS concentrations
computed from analytical results of monthly grab samples collected at these locations by MPG. As shown
on Figure 4, the equations capture most of the variability in annual average TDS concentrations at the
MWA and James Irrigation District Booster Plant. This reasonable correlation means other factors
(e.g., non-MPG discharges into Mendota Pool) that Westlands cites as being responsible for exceedances
of the TDS significance threshold of 450 mg/L have little effect. Increases in TDS concentrations above
those measured in DMC water conveyed to Fresno Slough are due almost entirely to the salinity of
groundwater pumped into the Pool by MPG.

41 Annual average TDS concentrations are missing for most years in which no exchange occurred because MPG
generally collects and analyzes surface water samples in only those years where exchange of groundwater for CVP
surface water takes place. See Final EIS/EIR. p. 201.

Booster Plant are increasing over time and water quality degradation along Fresno Slough will persist and
if possibly worsen if MPG continues to pump groundwater into Fresno Slough.
As shown on Figure 4 and summarized in Table 1, annual average TDS concentrations for surface water at
MWA and the James Irrigation District Booster Plant are already greater than 450 mg/L, which is the
threshold of significance for impacts to surface water established for the Proposed Action.45 Thus, MPG
groundwater transfer pumping has led to significant impacts to water quality within Fresno Slough.

Salinity Impacts of MPG Groundwater Transfer Pumping Are Significantly Underestimated
The surface water budget models employed in the Final EIS/EIR to assess impacts to surface water quality by the Proposed Action were validated based on conditions and TDS concentrations observed at Mendota
Dam and the MWA in 2012.47 LSCE states "[p]umping amounts and well concentrations from wells located
near the Fresno Slough were assigned based on reported or estimated amounts and water quality measurements taken in, or nearest to 2012."48 The resulting information was relied upon to validate the surface budget model for the southern branch of Mendota Pool. However, LSCE did not report the TDS
concentration in MPG groundwater pumped to the Pool that was used for validation purposes. EKI
estimates the TDS concentration in this groundwater to be approximately 880 mg/L based on information
contained in Table 5-10 of the LSCE Hydrogeologic Technical Analysis.

LSCE assumes a much lower TDS concentration in groundwater pumped to Mendota Pool by MPG when modeling impacts to surface water attributable to the Proposed Action. Based on Table 8-23 of the LSCE
Hydrogeologic Technical Analysis, EKI estimates that the TDS concentration is assumed to be 660 mg/L in
groundwater pumped to the Pool for the next 20 years. No explanation iS given for why future TDS
concentrations are expected to be lower than current TDS concentrations in groundwater pumped to the
Pool.

The Proposed Action is not expected to improve groundwater quality. LSCE forecasts TDS concentrations
will rise by an average of 20 mg/L in shallow groundwater and 40 mg/L in deep groundwater at the MWA
by the end of the Proposed Action 20-year project life.49 Further, the design constraints associated with
the Proposed Action were largely in effect in 2012 and their ongoing implementation5o cannot justify the
lower TDS concentration assumed in MPG groundwater transfer volumes during the Proposed Action
because the design constraints have not been able to stop TDS concentrations from rising due to MPG
transfer pumping to date. The TDS concentration assumed for groundwater pumped to Fresno Slough by
MPG is not a reasonable estimate of future conditions. Accordingly, impacts to surface water quality are
underestimated in the Final EIS/EIR.

Short-Term Effects Are Not Properly Evaluated
Westlands does not properly evaluate short-term effects of the Proposed Action. The short-term effects resulting from the variability in the annual volume of MPG groundwater transferred to Mendota Pool is
not considered in the Final EIS/EIR. Westlands assumes the transfer volume will remain constant at
21,053 AFY throughout the 20-year project life of the Proposed Action. Westlands does not give a
justification for this assumption. A constant exchange volume does not reflect how MPG has performed
transfer pumping to date or will do so throughout the Proposed Action.
2 Table 2 summarizes MPG transfer volumes by year and lists the Water Year Hydrologic Classification Indices for the San Joaquin Valley assigned by the California Department of Water Resources for these
years. Table 2 shows that the volume of groundwater pumped by MPG into Mendota Pool varies
dramatically by the rainfall amount for a given year. Groundwater is commonly exchanged during normal
and dry years and not wet years.

This mode of operation was required by Settlement Agreement No. 1 for the 10-year program that encompassed the years 2001 through 2010. Settlement Agreement No. allowed exchanges only during
normal and dry years. 51 Although this requirement was removed when Settlement Agreement No. 2 went
into effect in 2011,52 MPG still conducted exchanges only in normal and dry years between 2011 and 2017.

The amount of rainfall experienced in a year will continue to govern the corresponding annual
groundwater transfer volume pumped to Mendota Pool. Westlands states "[t]he total amount of
groundwater pumped would be dependent upon the amount of precipitation in a given year. For instance,
the amount of groundwater pumped by MPG may be greater during a dry year and less in years where
there is more rainfall and natural irrigation of crops."53 Westlands notes other factors also are important
in determining transfer volumes, including review of monitoring data, demonstrated effectiveness of
design constraints and management strategies, changes imposed by Groundwater Sustainability Plans, and necessary approvals by Reclamation and local entities.54
MPG may need to pump the maximum volume of 26,316 AFY allowed under the Proposed Action during
normal and dry years to compensate for lower volumes pumped during wet years. A volume of 26,316 AFY is 25 percent more than the volume of 21,053 AFY assumed by Westlands in its Final EIS/EIR analysis.

The predicted TDS concentration in surface water at MWA is proportional to the transfer volume as
derived by the surface water budget models in the Final EIS/EIR. Westlands predicts the surface water
TDS concentration will be 414 mg/L50 at MWA when the MPG groundwater transfer volume is 21,053 AFY.
If 25 percent more groundwater is transferred to Mendota Pool, the surface water budget models would
predict a rise in the TDS concentration to 518 mg/L, which is greater than the threshold for significance of
450 mg/L.

In actuality, the TDS concentration would be much higher than 518 mg/L because Westlands assumes an
unreasonably low salinity for MPG groundwater transferred to the Pool, as discussed in the prior section
of this technical review. If the TDS concentration of 880 mg/L in MPG groundwater used to validate the
surface water budget models is substituted for the TDS concentration of 660 mg/L in MPG groundwater
assumed by Westlands in its simulations, then the TDS concentration in surface water at MWA increases
to 690 mg/L when the maximum allowable groundwater volume of 26,316 AFY is transferred to Mendota
Pool during normal years when no curtailment of CVP surface water supplies occurs.
Even higher TDS concentrations in surface water would be measured under drought conditions. 61
However, the assumptions underpinning the Final EIS/EIR's evaluation of short-term effects during dry
years are implausible and without justification. The Final EIS/EIR attributes the TDS increase in the
southern portion of Mendota Pool solely to a 13,000 AFY reduction in DMC flows to MWA during the dry
year simulation. 62 No justification is provided for this assumption.
Reduction of James Irrigation District's contracted CVP surface water supplies during a dry year alone
could surpass 13,000 AFY. As explained in comments on the draft EIS/EIR, James Irrigation District receives
9,700 AFY of CVP water from Shasta Lake under a settlement contract. If the forecasted natural inflow to
Shasta Lake is less than certain values, a Shasta Critical Year is declared and deliveries under the
settlement contract are 7,600 AFY, 63 which amounts to a reduction of 2,100 AFY. In addition, James
Irrigation District generally receives 35 percent of its 35,300 AFY (i.e., 12,400 AFY) of south of delta water
supply allotted under a CVP water supply contract. 64 Water delivered pursuant to this contract is expected
to decline due to recent adoption of amendments to the State Water Resources Control Board Water
Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary and could be
suspended completely during dry years.

Therefore, curtailment of James Irrigation District's CVP surface water supplies during a drought could
total 14,500 AFY. The decrease of CVP surface water flow in Fresno Slough would be greater than this

volume because Tranquility Irrigation District, Fresno Slough Water District, and other CVP water users
along Fresno Slough also would experience reductions in their CVP surface water supplies.

Despite predicting a reduction of 13,000 AFY during the dry year simulation, Westlands does not assume
more MPG groundwater would be pumped to Fresno Slough to partially offset this shortfall. The MPG transfer volumes to MWA are assumed to be 10,446 AFY5 for each year of the Proposed Action and for the dry year simulation.66 This assumption is at odds with the purpose of the Proposed Action. As
Westlands states:

Exchange water represents a supplemental supply in dry years to MPG farmlands in
Westlands that are developed with permanent crops (e.g., orchards, vineyards), which
require a reliable and continuous supply of irrigation water for the crop to survive. If
exchange water becomes unavailable, these farmers may have to remove substantial
areas of high-value permanent crops and instead switch to lower-value annual crops
(e.g., alfalfa, wheat, barley) as they are more readily fallowed in dry years when there
isn't sufficient water supply to meet demand.57
The record of MPG transfer pumping (see Table 2) indicates more groundwater is exchanged in dry years
than normal years. The short-term effect of transferring greater volumes of higher salinity groundwater
to Fresno Slough during dry years is not evaluated in the Final EIS/EIR.

SUMMARY

In summary, the Final EIS/EIR method of analysis and modeling of water quality impacts to James Irrigation
District and others downstream of the Proposed Action's discharges of highly saline native groundwater into the Mendota Pool (in lieu of high-quality DMC supplies) grossly underestimate water quality impacts
to James Irrigation District and others along Fresno Slough and is otherwise flawed for several reasons.
These include:

1. While past discharges from MPG wells directly and/or cumulatively caused adverse water quality
exceedances at the MWA and James Irrigation District Booster Plant surface water intake off
Fresno Slough (e.g., Final EIS/EIR, Tables 21 and 27), the Final EIS/EIR reaches the opposite
conclusion about Proposed Action discharges. However, the Final EIS/EIR fails to explain key
modeling assumptions and facts relied upon to reach the conclusion that the Proposed Action will
not - contrary to past discharges, result in future downstream exceedances of the designated

65 This assumed volume is less than the actual groundwater volumes that MPG has generally transferred to Fresno
Slough in the past (see Table 2). No explanation for the assumed smaller MPG groundwater transfer volume is
in provided in the Final EIS/EIR.

significance threshold or applicable water quality standards including at MWA and the
downstream James Irrigation District Booster Plant surface water intake.

a. For example, Westlands uses surface water budget models, which it validates with data that
are not disclosed, and those models predict lower TDS concentrations that conflict with actual
MPG data that confirm exceedances of the significance threshold (see Figures 1 and 2).

b. As another example, the surface water budget models do not disclose the TDS data used for
validation, but our analysis indicates that the Final EIS/EIR assumes TDS concentrations lower
than current levels.

2. The following key assumptions in the Final EIS/EIR's surface water quality analysis that EKI was
able to discern based on its technical expertise are clearly counter-factual, unreasonable, and
unwarranted:

a. The Final EIS/EIR assumes that non-MPG pump-ins, about which it confessedly lacks data, are
the predominant factor driving salinity increases and exceedances in Fresno Slough. However,
actual MPG data including data within the Final EIS/EIR itself and EKI's analysis shows that the
MPG pump-ins are by far the largest (almost exclusive) contributing factor causing elevated
salinity and exceedances with the contribution from non-MPG pump-ins being relatively small
(see, e.g., Figure 3).

b. The Final EIS/EIR uses over simplistic modeling that, among other flaws, assumes rapid and
complete mixing upon discharge of groundwater into Mendota Pool, which does not in fact
occur in the Pool, and does not simulate the actual surface water flow regime in the Pool,
resulting in unreliable results and underestimated water quality impacts downstream.

C. The Final EIS/EIR assumes uniform or average distribution of the 20-year pumping amount
across the 20-year project life, despite the obvious fact that wet and dry year pumping will be
different, which results in underestimated water quality impacts downstream. Averaging
effectively ignores likely exceedances in dry years, when greater than average MPG
groundwater volumes are exchanged (see, e.g., Final EIS/EIR, Table 17) and the baseline
conditions are likely worse due to drought conditions (see, e.g., Final EIS/EIR, Table 18).

3. Finally, even if a technical consultant could make sense of how cumulative water quality
exceedances experienced by James Irrigation District and others during the prior 20 plus years of
similar Proposed Action discharges into the Pool will somehow not continue with future
discharges, that is not something that is explained in nor can be readily understood from reading
the Final EIS/EIR or even the technical appendices.

Mendota Pool Group 20-Year Exchange Program Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) State Clearinghouse # 2013041028
Subject: Joint Document of U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation and Westlands Water District
November 2018

Date: January 11, 2019

Introduction:

The water quality James Irrigation District (JID or James ID) receives from the Mendota Pool has taken a decided turn for the worse in the twenty years since the Mendota Pool Group Pumpers (MPG) began
pumping well water into the Mendota Pool and exchanging it for high-quality Delta-Mendota Canal
(DMC) surface water delivered to their properties in Westlands Water District (WWD), as facilitated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation or USBR). The environmental impacts of
implementing a similar exchange program for another twenty years (Project) have been partially studied by MPG, WWD, and Reclamation in the subject draft EIS/EIR. Surprisingly, the EIS/EIR concludes that no significant environmental impacts would occur as a result of the Project in spite of ample evidence to
the contrary in the documents themselves. Furthermore, the document is deficient for its failure to
analyze the impacts to JID, despite the fact that JID is likely to suffer more than others from the water quality impacts of the Project.
The following is a technical review of subject draft EIS/EIR. Our resumes are attached hereto in Attachment A - Resumes to document our background and expertise to perform the review.
Background:
JID is located southeast of the Mendota Wildlife Area (MWA) and covers the area around the City of San
Joaquin. JID provides irrigation water to (in 2018) 23,667 cropped acres. A large portion of JID's water
supply is delivered through the Delta-Mendota Canal (DMC) under the terms of two contracts with
Reclamation. The first is a settlement contract (Reclamation Contract No. 14-06-200-700-A, dated
December 23, 1963) made with JID in settlement of its water rights on the Fresno Slough and San
Joaquin River (SJR) that were impaired by the construction of Friant Dam on the SJR at Millerton Lake,
under which Reclamation provides up to 9,700 AF of Schedule 2 water in normal years and 7,600 AF in
dry years according to the schedule in Table 1.

The second is a Central Valley Project water supply contract (Reclamation Contract No. 14-06-200-700A-
LTR1, dated February 25, 2005 for up to 35,300 acre-feet of water each year. The water is generally delivered in the spring and summer months and varies each year based on demand, availability, and schedules set by the USBR. These water deliveries averaged 13,706 AF/year between 2005 and 2014, or only 39% of the contract amount.
Failure to Study JID:
The primary study area for the EIS/EIR exclude JID. As shown in figure 36 on page 184 of the EIS/EIR, it is notable that Mendota Pool continuous water quality check points are located only at the Exchange
Contractor Canals and Mendota Wildlife Area (MWA), but not immediately downstream in the Fresno Slough at the JID P-Booster Plant. The EIS/EIR also does not contain any discussion of the impacts the
Project will have, and is already having, on the water quality received by JID. It is also noticeable that
the 'program design constraints" are concerned with minimizing impacts on water quality for the
Exchange Contractors, Wonderful Orchards, and the MWA, but not JID.
This exclusion of JID from the study area and failure to study impacts to James, and its soils, crops, and groundwater, is not justified. Study of impacts to MWA is insufficient to understand the impacts to
James, which has different water uses, needs, and environmental resources at stake. In addition, JID is
downstream from the MWA, and stopping the analysis at the MWA ignores two important realities.
One is that there are many wells that discharge into the Pool between the MWA's intake and JID that
also substantially degrade water quality. The other is that JID relies on blending higher-quality DMC
water, delivered through the Mendota Pool, for dilution of its well water to protect crops.
The existing Project design constraints are flawed because they only constrain pumping on poor quality
wells for exchange purposes when quality at Exchange Contractor canals and/or Mendota Pool exceed triggering thresholds, and only at certain times of the year that don't correlate to JID's irrigation season.
And, pumping of poor-quality wells is allowed to continue for "local" Pool Pumper purposes (but not
exchange to their lands in WWD) even when that degrades water delivered to MWA and JID.
Water Quality Impacts in JID:
The water quality section fails to properly address the poor quality (high in constituents of concern
including SAR, Boron, and TDS) of the groundwater received by JID as a result of this project. The
problem is confirmed by data collected by Provost & Prichard and by data contained in the EIS/EIR itself.
Provost & Prichard maintains and operates an Electrical Conductivity (EC) meter at the P-Booster plant. Daily readings from June 1, 2007 to June 19, 2018 were used to obtain approximate TDS readings by multiplying EC measurements in DS/m by 640. That data is graphed and attached hereto as Attachment
B - June 2007 through June 19, 2018 - Approx TDS (ppm) at P Booster. The extremely high TDS readings in 2014 (a critically dry year) stand out, as seen below in Figure 1.

The severity of in the problem in 2014 is also demonstrated in the EIS/EIR itself. Table 17 on page 183
includes data from grab sampling at the James P-Booster Plant reported in the 2014 Annual Report, Mendota Pool Group Pumping and Monitoring Program. Those samples had a median TDS of 992 a mg/L
and a maximum of 998 mg/L. Mendota Pool Group pump in water was a significant portion of the water put into the Pool and of the water received by JID in 2014 and other drought years that contributed
greatly to cumulative impacts on JID from those pump ins.
Table 21 on page 189 of the EIS/EIR reveals that during 2014 the water received by JID was also very high in other constituents of concern, most importantly boron. The samples had a median boron concentration of 500 ug/L and up to 1150 ug/L.
As explained below, these high levels of degradation will have significant impacts in James.
Crop and Soil Impacts in JID:
Some of the crops grown throughout JID, and particularly in the northern area that receives mostly
undiluted Mendota Pool Water, are very sensitive to salinity and Boron. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the Crops in 2017 throughout JID. Also, many of the soils throughout JID, and particularly in the northern area, are vulnerable to sodicity problems (i.e. soil sealing and loss of permeability due to sodium imbalance, as indicated by elevated Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR).

In 2018, of JID's 23,667 cropped acres (see Attachment C - District Crop Production Report Jan-Nov -
2018), 12,038 were crops sensitive to salinity, boron, or both. Those crops include onions (2,187 acres),
lettuce (67 acres), grapes (1,766 acres), almonds (7,867 acres), and walnuts (151 acres). Sweetcorn is also sometimes grown (James ID 2018 Operations Report - Page 6 - Crop Production DRAFT 01/02/09).

Many of these crops grown in JID suffer reduced yields at salinity levels far below 800 mg/L, including
onions (512 mg/L), lettuce (576 mg/L), grapes and almonds (640 mg/L), and walnuts and sweetcorn (704
mg/L).' A yield reduction of 10% is expected for is onions at 768 mg/L, lettuce and almonds at 896 mg/L, walnuts at 1,024 mg/L, and grapes and sweetcorn at 1,088 mg/L.2 All of these thresholds were exceeded at some point in 2014, and according to data in the EIS/EIR itself the median TDS was 992 mg/L. That level exceeds the 10% yield reduction threshold for onions, lettuce, and almonds, which together make up over 42% of the cropped acreage in JID. By contrast, water in the DMC that year was
measured at 481 mg/L, which does not exceed any of these thresholds. Furthermore, it is not clear how
the annual averages in table 17 of the EIR were derived, and short-term concentrations may have been
significantly higher, as evidenced by the data from Provost & Prichard's EC meter in Figure 1. Such
averaging ignores the impacts of even brief periods of extreme concentrations, and the lack of
transparency in how the averages are derived is detrimental to the understandability of the document.
Boron sensitivity for onions, grapes, and walnuts begins in the range of 0.5-0.75 mg/L (500-750 ug/L). The EIS/EIR does contain any analysis of the effects of the project on boron concentrations. Table 6-1 in
Appendix D of EIS/EIR reports boron content from five grab samples at the JID booster plant with a
minimum of 0.4 mg/L, a maximum of 1.5 mg/L, and median 0.5 mg/L. These levels, therefore, are at
times sufficient to cause damage to boron sensitive crops, and boron is known to be much more difficult to leach out of crop root zones than salts are.
Problems with soil structure, infiltration, and permeability are strongly correlated with sodium imbalance (measured by high SAR).3 The EIR/EIS does not discuss the projects impact on SARs or report SAR values that would allow a determination of the extent of the impact to JID. However, SAR data are reported for individual MPG pumper wells in Tables E1, E2, and E3 of Annual Reports Mendota Pool
Group Pumping and Monitoring Program (attached hereto in Attachment D - Appendices E1, E2, and E3 of 2016 Annual Report Mendota Pool Group Pumping and Monitoring Program), and many are very high. SAR values from periodic grab samples at the JID booster plant are reported in Table G-1 of the 2016 Annual Report Mendota Pool Group Pumping and Monitoring Program (attached hereto in Attachment E - Table G-1 of the 2016 Annual Report Mendota Pool Group Pumping and Monitoring
Program). Most of the values fall in the "increasing problems" range, and four are in the severe
problems range.
Irrigation water with higher TDS and boron concentrations also requires more leaching water to avoid accumulating salts and boron in the root zone. It is possible to calculate the additional amount of water
required to remove salts if TDS is known. But there are no guidelines for calculating leaching
requirements for boron. However, even if water is available at a price JID's growers can afford (not
likely in drought years) and applied properly, leaching moves the salts and boron into the groundwater,

which presents problems for well water quality and future regulation under the Irrigated Lands
Regulatory Program.
Other crop, soil problems, and irrigation system problems can occur due to high Chlorides, high PH, and
water hardness that are also not disclosed, analyzed, or discussed in the Draft EIR/EIS. in These problems
can be associated with:
High Chlorides - toxic to some sensitive crops through root absorption after surface irrigation
and crop leaves burn after sprinkler applications
High Nitrates - high levels can cause some crops to develop excessive vegetation instead of food
or fiber production
Bicarbonate - overhead sprinkling of certain fruits and vegetable can leave "whitewash" on the
skin of the produce that reduces its marketability
pH Imbalance • water outside the normal range of 6.5 - 8.4 can negatively impact plant physiological processes, soils and/or irrigation systems by dissolving or precipitating salts and
through water hardness effects.
Manganese - can be toxic to some plants and/or feed slime-causing bacteria that can foul
irrigation systems
Iron - concentrations greater than 5.0 mg/I may cause nutritional imbalances in certain crops
and/or can feed slime-causing bacteria that can foul irrigation systems
Corrosivity or Erosivity - Certain combinations and concentrations of ions can increase the
corrosion potential of water and soils in contact with metal or concrete components of irrigation
distribution systems and on-farm irrigation systems.
Additional Salt Load to JID:
It is also important to understand that many tons of salt will come into JID as a result of the exchange
Project that cause crop, soil, and groundwater problems, as noted above. The EIR/EIS does not account for this significant impact. As an example of is how severe the problem is in dry years, consider the
additional salt load to JID in May-September of 2014.
Table 2 (on the next page) shows the additional tons of salt brought into JID at the P-Booster Plant
(above the amount that would have been brought in using DMC water if TDS was 450 mg/l) due to
elevated salinity in those months.4

Flawed Mixing Model:
The EIS/EIR relies on a flawed Mendota Pool mixing model that produces results inconsistent with actual
readings in years for which the model was not validated. Mixing is done in two separate sections of the
Pool independently, even though iS there is no physical barrier in the Pool at "Section AA" (see EIS/EIR
Figure 6-1 in Appendix E part 1), and "complete mixing" is assumed on a monthly time step in each
section. This means there are no factors for daily variation of activities, Pool water flow currents, wind-
driven wave effects, dispersion, and advection as actually occur. The mixing model was not calibrated, rather it was "validated" but only using data from 2012, which followed an abundant water year (water
year 2011) but was itself classified as dry. Therefore, supplies carried over in storage facilities from prior
years delivered to and through the Pool made 2012 non-typical for dry conditions. It is particularly
unjustified not to validate the model using data from water year 2014, the second half of a historic
drought. The 2014 data presented in Table 17 of the EIS/EIR indicate a severe problem in dry years,
which will be worse when cumulative projects and other future developments are considered, including
climate change and the recently approved Bay Delta Water Quality Control Plan Update, that make
future critical dry years like 2014 (and 2013) more likely. While the EIS/EIR does admit that concentrations of constituents of concern were high in 2014, it does not discuss Project constraints,
mitigation, or alternatives that would avoid or substantially lessen those impacts to JID or realistically
describe the impacts of the Project in future, similar years.
The baseline assumptions that feed the groundwater and mixing model are also not reasonable. It is
assumed that MPG wells will pump approximately 33,395 AF/year into the Pool without the Project (No Project/No Action Alternative) for use on MPG owners' lands near the Pool (rather than in WWD),
despite the fact that Figure 2 on page shows that such adjacent uses account for a smaller share of
pumping than the transfer pumping, between 5,000-15,000 AF/year. In an attempt to justify this assumption, the analysis assumes "reactivation of fallowed farmland" and "continuation of crop
conversion trends," an unlikely combination of outcomes in light of the future implementation of the
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). It also assumes an unreasonably high water
demand of 5.1 AF/year per acre.
Averaging and Short-Term Impacts:
Tables 25 and 26 on pages 201-202 of the EIS/EIR predict no significant impact on TDS at MWA, but in light of the dry year data (from 2014) in Table 17 it is difficult to understand how this can be so. It

appears that some kind of averaging over the 20-year period is being employed, but the method is not
clear even to an expert much less to the target audience of the document (decision-makers and the
public). Furthermore, such averaging effectively ignores short-term changes in water quality that can
have both short-term and medium-term impacts on crops and long-term impacts on soils, e.g., accumulation and loading of salts into James's soils and groundwater. Salts tend to increase in
concentration (versus irrigation water concentration) and sometimes precipitate out as they move
downward through the crop root zone and soluble salts travel out the bottom with leachate toward
groundwater as crop evapotranspiration removes pure water from the root zone. For example, by simple mass balance, irrigating with 800 mg/l irrigation water with salts that don't precipitate in the soil
and a ten percent leaching fraction can push leachate concentrations as high as 8,000 mg/l.
One year irrigating almonds, onions and other sensitive crops with water above thresholds for TDS, SAR,
and boron is enough to cause yield and/or crop quality reductions and lasting soil permeability problems (without corresponding gypsum and leaching water to counteract the effects, both of which add more salts to the groundwater).
Conclusion:
Based on our review of the subject EIS/EIR, We believe it ignores critically important areas of analysis, particularly with respect to significant impacts to JID, rests on faulty assumptions, and does not present a complete and accurate picture of the environmental resource conditions at stake within JID's
boundaries and the environmental impacts of the Project to JID, it growers, and their crops, soils and groundwater. JID will suffer significant impacts to its crops, soils, and groundwater that are not even discussed let alone analyzed.
