NOUAWN Petitioner Citizens For Responsible Growth (collectively "Petitioner") petition this Court --
for a Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondents Town of Loomis and the Town Council of the
Town of Loomis ("Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' August 11,2020, and
certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Costco Wholesale Project
and approval of the Project. Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals for the Project
violate the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code section

9 21000 et seq. Additionally, the Project is inconsistent with the Town of Loomis General Plan

10 and the City of Mount Shasta General Plan contrary to the State Planning Laws. (Gov't Code
65300 et seq.) Petitioner alleges as follows:

11 1. PARTIES

12

13 Petitioner Citizens For Responsible Growth ("CRG") is an unincorporated

14 association formed after the approval of the Project. CRG is established to promote quality

15 local and regional planning, land use and development, as well as to preserve a healthy human

16 and natural environment in the Placer County area. CRG and its members have a direct and

17 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with the laws relating to

18 zoning and environmental protection. CRG's members, have long-standing interests in the

19 area adjacent to the Project site, as well as in the surrounding community and County as a 4aan

whole. CRG's environmental, aesthetic, cultural and

20 property interests will be severely injured -

21 if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other

22 laws. CRG's members enjoy the County's and State's natural resources. Petitioner brings this

23 petition on behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to be named and

24 brought before this Court as petitioners. Citizens for Responsible Growth was formed after

25 Respondents' approval of the Project. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177(c).) Petitioner is

26 within the class of persons and entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of

27 Respondents as alleged below. CRG's members participated in the administrative processes

28 herein by submitting comment letters and objecting to the Project. Petitioner has exhausted its
remedies. Accordingly, Petitioner has standing to sue. The interests of CRG will be harmed
by the Project unless court action is taken and Petitioner's requested relief is granted.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

2. Respondent Town of Loomis is a political subdivision of the State of California and
OUAW N a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. Town of Loomis is the CEQA
"lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the Town is responsible for
preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
necessary evaluates miti gation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
environmental impacts. The Town also has principal responsibility for determining whether
projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use ordinances and other
cp applicable laws.

10 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

11 behalf of the Town of Loomis. Respondent Town Council of the Town of Loomis is

12 responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the Town including, but not limited

13 to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14

14 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable
15 land use ordinances and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the Town,
16 the Town of Loomis establishes overall County priorities and sets policy. The Town of
17 Loomis is the governing body of the Town and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and
18 approving or denying the Project
19 4. Real Party in Interest Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Crystal Geyser") is a State
20 of Washington corporation that is authorized to conduct business in the State of California.
21 Costco Wholesale Corporation is the applicant for the Project that is being challenged by this
22 Petition. Costco Wholesale Corporate offices are located at 999 Lake Drive, Issaquah,
23 Washington.

24 5. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and

25 21 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
26 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

27 allege, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for

28 all acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

co NO0AW N p and Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if
necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

12 A. Project Location BACKGROUND FACTS

13 8.

14

15 The Project is located on 17.41 acres at the southeast intersection of Sierra College

16 Boulevard and Brace Road. The Project is on the following Assessor Parcel Numbers ("APN")
045-042-011, 045-042-012, 045-042-023, 045-042-034, 045-042-035, 045-042-036, and 045-

17 042-037 owned by Costco. The Project site is currently vacant. Annual grassland and valley -

18 oak woodland characterize the site.

9.

19 The General Plan designation, zoning, and existing land use on the Project site

20 parcels are General Commercial; Residential High Density and Residential Medium High

21

22 Density. The property to the north of the Project has a General Plan designation of Residential
High Density and General Commercial. The property to the east has a General Plan

23

24 designation Residential Medium Density Residential and Medium High Density. The property
to the south has a General Plan designation of City of Rocklin Retail Commercial and Mixed-

25 Use. The property to the west has a General Plan designation of Retail Commercial and is in
the City of Rocklin.

26 B. The Project

27 10.

28 The Project includes the construction and operation of an approximately 155,000-
square-foot warehouse retail facility and a fueling station at the corner of Sierra College

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

- Boulevard and Brace Road. The warehouse retail space is approximately 149,500 square feet
2 of floor space. The warehouse building includes an approximately 5,500-square-foot tire
w tuno center. The tire center includes tire sales and tire installation facility with five bays facing

east.

11. Access to the Project is via a 59-foot-wide driveway on Sierra College
Boulevard., a 30-foot-wide right-in/right-out access on Brace Road, and a 25-foot wide gated
emergency-access-only driveway on Brace Road.
co 12. Vehicles approaching the warehouse from Sierra College Boulevard would enter

9 the site at a new 59-foot-wide signalized driveway at Sierra College Boulevard with one

10 inbound and three outbound lanes. The signal is to be located approximately 750 feet south of
11 Brace Road and 625 feet north of Granite Drive, measured centerline to centerline. Northbound

12 vehicles on Sierra College Boulevard would enter the property through a new right turn lane on
13 Sierra College Boulevard while southbound vehicles would turn left onto the signalized
14 driveway from a new dedicated left turn lane. The main driveway on Sierra College Boulevard
15 is positioned to serve as the primary access point to both the warehouse and the fueling station.
16 The Brace Road driveway is to be located 215 feet east of Sierra College Boulevard, measured
17 curb to curb, and this access point would be 30- foot-wide right-in, right-out only driveway,
18 primarily used by warehouse delivery trucks, but publicly accessible.
19 13. The Brace Road access will serve as the daytime delivery truck route to reduce

20 traffic delays on Sierra College Boulevard. Night-time warehouse deliveries are supposed to
21 access the loading docks via the main signalized driveway from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m..
22 14. A gated emergency access point on Brace Road would be located east of Sierra
23 Meadows Apartments, and this 25-foot-wide driveway shall only be used as an emergency
24 access and evacuation route.

25 15. Other roadway improvements for the Project include a new, third northbound
26 travel lane, sidewalks, a and a Class II bike lane on Sierra College Boulevard along the project
27 frontage, a dedicated right turn lane on Sierra College Boulevard approaching Brace Road, balf-
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

F street improvements along the Project's Brace Road frontage, traffic signal interconnect
N between Granite Drive and Brace Road, and a raised median on Brace Road to ensure the
Brace Road driveway allows only right-in/right-out movement at the Costco driveway, while +10OA maintaining full access to Homewood Lumber and the Sierra Meadows Apartments.
16. The warehouse will be located near the northern boundary of the project site and
the fueling station will be located on the southwest corner of the site. The warehouse building
will set back approximately 66-feet from Sierra College Boulevard,
8 17. Along Brace Road, the northern perimeter, the Project includes a 60-foot building
9 setback, including a 30-foot drive aisle and a landscape buffer/drainage bioswale ranging in
10 width from 20 to 23 feet. The eastern and southern portions of the project site contain surface
11 parking and landscaping and a bioswale, which would provide setbacks of 38 feet and 20 feet,
12 respectively, from the adjacent property line.
13 18. The loading dock for the Costco warehouse will be located on the southwest side

14 of the warehouse, away from residential uses located north and east of the project site. The
15 loading dock would consist of 4 bays that are screened with a wall on the west side. A smaller
16 on-grade door would be located on the west side of the building to receive smaller deliveries
17 such as baked goods and other shipments. Other warehouse facilities located on the west side

18 of the building include a transformer and two trash compactors that would be painted
19 the same building color to blend those elements into the building. As shown in the visual
20 simulations, the setback, landscaping, and retaining walls would screen those utilitarian
21 elements from the street view.

22 19. The fueling station will be located in the southwest corner of the project site, -

23 adjacent to Sierra College Boulevard and includes a 7,560-square-foot canopy. The fueling
24 station will contain five covered fueling bays, each with up to three two-sided fuel dispensers
25 that would allow up to six vehicles to occupy each island. The station would have ten stacking
pumps at any given time, -- - 26 lanes, which would allow approximately 40 vehicles to queue for the
27 with 30 spaces at the dispensers for a total of 70 spaces. The station will initially have fueling

15 Governor's Office of Planning and Research, State Clearinghouse (SCH 2017052077) and with

16 the Placer County Clerk, as provided by Public Resources Code section 21152.

17 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

18 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

19 28. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

20 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

21 by law.

22 29. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section --

23 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written
24 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

25 30. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

26 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

27 proceedings relating to this action.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

L 31.

2 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

cJOuA W unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies,
Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

32. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of
Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

33. STANDING

9 Petitioner, formed after Respondents approval of the Project, has standing to

10 assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner's aesthetic, environmental and

11

12 property interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's certification of the EIR
and approval of the Project. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177(c).)

13 34. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

14 Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

15 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioner's attorneys' fees in actions to

16 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in
question.

17

18 35. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

19 Petitioner brings this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil

20 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

21 affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a

22 significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondent Town does not

23 approve the Project in the absence of lawful environmental review and compliance with

24 applicable local and state zoning law.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Abuse of Discretion

26 36. Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

27 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

28 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 35.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

37. In approving the Project as described herein, Respondents prejudicially abused
their discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168 and
m tnnop Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, because the Town certified an EIR that fails to
include information necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation,
including information necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of
the Project's environmental impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the
Project's significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the

8 Project's significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to use the best available

9 information and/or accepted methodology for analyzing information; because the Final EIR
10 fails to provide good faith responses to comments on the Draft EIR and Draft Recirculated

11 EIR; because the Town failed and refused to provide a stable, the Town failed to make

12 required findings, failed to support the findings with substantial evidence, and failed to

13 disclose the analytic route showing how the evidence supports the findings.

14 A. THE FINAL EIR CONTAINS A FLAWED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

15 38. CEQA requires that an environmental review document contain an accurate

16 description of the entire project. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d

17 185, 193.) The adequacy of an EIR's project description is closely linked to the adequacy of

18 the impact analyses. If the description is inadequate because it fails to discuss an aspect of the

19 project, the environmental analysis will probably reflect the same mistake. (See San Joaquin

20 Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.3d 713, 722-723.)

21 39. In County of Inyo, the court stated that "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project

22 description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (Id.) CEQA

23 requires a complete project description to ensure that all of the project's environmental impacts

24 are considered. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1450, 1454.)

25 As stated in County of Inyo, "[a] curtailed or distorted project description may stultify the

26 objectives of the reporting process. Only through an accurate view of the project may affected

27 outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental

28 cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantages of terminating the proposal (i.e., the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

Nm tnop "no project" alternative) and weigh other alternatives in the balance." (71 Cal.App.3d at 192-
193; see also Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 -

Cal.App.4th 70, 82 [court found project description inadequate where EIR concealed, ignored,
excluded, or simply failed to provide pertinent information" regarding a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the project].) A curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project
description draws a red herring across the path of public input." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue

g Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656; quoting County of Inyo, supra,
71 Cal.App.3d at 197-198.)
9 40.

10 The Final EIR's Project Description provides inaccurate and confusing information

11 regarding the Brace Road entrance by overstating the separation distance between the Brace Road
driveway and Sierra College Boulevard.
12 41.

13 FEIR Project Description Section 2.3.4 states that "Fuel would typically be delivered.

14 to the fueling station by double-axle trucks". Actually, single-unit, double-axle fuel delivery trucks

15 have become almost nonexistent. Single-unit fuel delivery trucks are almost universally 3-axle

16 vehicles. And deliveries by 5-axle tractor-trailer rigs and 7-axle tractor-double trailer rigs are quite

17 common. The notion that fuel deliveries would be by 2-axle units is implausible.

42.

18 Section 2.3.4 of the Project Description provides a confusing and unstable description
regarding nighttime deliveries.

19 43.

20 The Project Description treats the second Brace Road access near the northeast corner

21 of the Project site an emergency access/egress only. But the Project Description fails to mention

22 what process would have to be followed to convert this to a public access should the limitations of

23 the current public access/egress points to the site prove to cause intolerable congestion and the
and Costco desire to open
24 the emergency access to general public use in response. 83

44.

25 The Project Description is ambiguous as to whether a proposed direct access to

26 Granite Drive is part of the Project. The Project Description section 2.3.2.1.3 states in part:

27 "Should the City of Rocklin grant access, in coordination with the City of Rocklin, Costco will be

28 conditioned to construct driveway access to the edge of the Costco property that would connect to
access provided as part of an anticipated development involving the adjacent property, and would
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

ultimately provide another access point for the project to and from Granite Drive. With Costco,
NO0 AW N City of Rocklin and Town approval of the connection location, the Granite Drive connection to the
Costco site will be aligned with a connection constructed on this adjacent property." Project
Description is inadequate in failing to make clear what the Town's intent and whether Granite Drive
iS part of the current project.
B. THE FINAL EIR FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PROJECT'S

INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE GENERAL PLAN

co 45. CEQA requires an environmental document to discuss any inconsistencies

9 between the Project and the applicable general plans, specific plans and regional plans.

10 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125(d).) An applicable plan is a plan that has been adopted and
11 legally applies to the Project. (Chaparral Greens v. City of Chula Vista (1996) 50 Cal.App.4a

12 1134, 1145, n. 2.) By identifying a project's inconsistencies with applicable plans means that a -
13 lead agency may be able to modify the project to avoid the inconsistencies. (See Orinda Ass'n
14 v. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1169.) While an inconsistency with
15 policies of applicable plans does not necessarily mean that the project will have a significant

16 environmental impact CEQA requires that the environmental document contain the discussion

17 and analysis. (See Joshua Tree Downtown Business Alliance v. County of San Bernardino

18 (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Pocket Protectors V. City of Sacramento (2004) 124

19 Cal.App.4th 903.)

20 46. The EIR fails to address the Project's inconsistency with several of the Town's
21 mandatory General Plan policies.

22 a. Natural Resource and Open Space Policy 1.e. mandates that the Town
23 prepare a carbon modeling analysis. The Towns failed to prepare the mandated analysis and
24 instead deferred this General Plan obligation to another agency.
25 b. The Project fails to comply with Land Use Policy F.5, which states "New

26 commercial development shall preserve and integrate existing natural features (e.g. creeks,
27 native trees, rock outcrops) and topography into existing landscaping." The Town's addition

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

P of "where feasible" is not part of the General Plan policy and not consistent with the
N m v mandatory obligation set forth in the Policy,

C. Under the Town's General Plan, arterial facilities serve to connect areas of

major activity within the urban area of Loomis and function primarily to distribute cross-town
traffic from freeways/highways to collector streets. Within Loomis, arterial streets are mostly
two lane facilities with operating speeds ranging from 25 to 50 mph. (General Plan, at IV-6.) --ay
Brace Road is an east-west arterial from Sierra College Boulevard across 1-80 to Horseshoe

cC Bar Road. Brace Road has one lane in each direction. (Id. at IV-7.) "With the exception of

9 Sierra College Boulevard, none of the roadways within Loomis are posted as truck routes."

10 (Id. at IV-16.) "Brace Road has signs indicating truck weight restrictions." (Id.) Nothing in

11 the Final EIR or traffic study states whether the delivery trucks entering Brace Road will be

12 subject to the weight limits. There is nothing in the General Plan regarding Brace Road nor on

13 the weight limit sign indicating that such restrictions do not apply to the western portion of

14 Brace Road. The Final EIR fails to discuss or explain this inconsistency. -u

15 C. THE FINAL EXR FAILS TO ADDRESS THE PROJECT'S INCONSISTENCY WITH

16 THE ZONING ORDINANCES

17 47. The EIR also fails to adequately address the failure to amend the zoning code.

18 The EIR fails to provide an adequate discussion regarding the Project's inconsistency with the

19 current zoning. The Response to Comments states that no zoning change is proposed for the

20 parcels or portions of the parcels zoned RH or RM-5 as these parcels would be used for

21 parking, which is a permitted use in those zones. Table 2-2 in Loomis Municipal Code section

22 13.24.040 sets forth the allowable land uses for residential zoning districts, including RM and

23 RH. (See also LMC, § 13.22.030.) Nothing in Table 2-2 identifies parking lot for a

24 commercial project as an allowable use for residential districts.

25 48. The driveway entrance to the Project located on is Brace Road is also located on

26 land zoned residential. Again, nothing in the zoning code provides that a driveway for a

27 commercial center constitutes an allowable use in a residential district. (See Table 2-2, LMC

28 13.24.040.) -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

D. THE EIR FAILED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS, ANALYZE AND MITIGATE THE

PROJECT'S TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION IMPACTS
e t1nONc 49. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze and miti gate the Project's traffic

impacts.

50. The EIR fails to adequately disclose and address Vehicle Miles Travelled
("VMT") The VMT analysis for the EIR is based upon unsupported assumptions and makes

does not constitute substantial evidence.

51. The EIR fails to address critical errors regarding the cumulative buildout

9 assumptions.

10 52. The Project's fueling area geometry is likely to have queue overspill into the main

11 access drive from Sierra College Boulevard. Based upon observed weekday and weekend peak

12 queueing at five Costco fueling stations selected by Costco demonstrate the inadequacy of the

13 queue storage at the fueling station and the impact it will have on Sierra College Boulevard

14 given the site plan for the fueling area and the location of the entrance on Sierra College

15 Boulevard.

16 53. The EIR fails to disclose that the driveway location on Brace for all three options

17 violates the provisions of the Town of Loomis Land Development Manual. Section 6-3 of the

18 Manual states in relevant part: "Driveways shall be at least 200 feet apart on collector streets

19 and at least 250 feet apart on arterial streets. Driveways shall be at least 200 feet from an

20 intersection on collector streets.

21 54. The EIR also fails to adequately address the Project's traffic queuing issues. The

22 EIR fails to disclose and analyze the potential increases in delay and worsening level of service

23 associated with the queuing issues.

24 55. The EIR also fails to a provide a peak shopping season analysis

25 E. THE EIR'S MITIGATION MEASURES FOR NOISE VIOLATE CEQA

26 56. Mitigation Measure Noise 2 provides that the "Tire Center doors shall be closed

27 whenever pneumatic wrenches and tire breakers are used, to the maximum extent feasible."

28 The mitigation measure use of the term "to the maximum extent feasible" improperly defers -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 14

NOUA0 N formulation of the mitigation measure and fails to provide performance criteria regarding
compliance.

57. The Mitigation Measure Noise-2 requires that all truck deliveries entering and
exiting the project site between 10pm and 7am are restricted to the exclusive use of the Sierra
College Boulevard driveway and shall not use the Brace Road access. The EIR fails to state
how this mitigation measure will be enforced as the Brace Road access will not be gated or

8 controlled. Mitigation measures must be enforceable. Under CEQA "[a] public agency shall

9 provide the measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully

10 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other measures. (Pub. Resources Code,

§ 21081.6(b).

11 F.

12 58. THE EIR'S ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS FAILS TO COMPLY WITH CEQA.

13 The a EIR contains a legally flawed alternative analysis as it fails to contain a

14 reasonable range of feasible alternatives. (See Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21001(g); 21002.1(a);

15 CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6; Citizens of Goleta Valley v Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d

16 553, 566.) A lead agency must ensure "that all reasonable alternatives to proposed projects are

17 thoroughly assessed." (Wildlife Alive y. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 197; Pub.

18 Resources Code, § 21001(g) (lead agency must "consider alternatives to proposed actions

19 affecting the environment"); Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the

20 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400.) The agency evaluates whether the

21 alternatives are actually feasible. (California Native Plant Society v. City of Santa Cruz (2009)

22 177 Cal.App 4th 957,981; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.6(c), 15091(a)(3).) A determination

23 of infeasibility must be based upon substantial evidence, not just that it fails to meet an
objective.

24 59.

25 The EIR states that despite the Town of Loomis' General Plan's limitation of

26 truck deliveries to daytime hours for area adjacent to residential uses there is no feasible

27 alternative. (RDEIR at 3.6-18.) The EIR fails to adequately address why there are no feasible

28 alternati ves to the truck delivery site or that there are overriding transportation and traffic
management benefits to scheduling deliveries at night. The determination that there are no
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

- feasible alternatives must be supported by substantial evidence. (Habitat & Watershed

2 Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1305; King County Farm
e + v Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 211 Cal.App.3d 692, 737.

60. The EIR discusses only 2 alternatives in addition to the two no project alternatives: l)
no fueling; and 2) reduced floor space. However, an alternative with reduced floor space with no
fueling would allow for are design of the Project site to address almost all of the impacts associated
with the Project, including traffic access and noise.
co 61. The EIR's failure to address the feasibility of alternatives such as reducing the

9 size of the warehouse store or eliminating the fueling facility. Such alternatives are dismissed

10 on the grounds that they do not the project objectives.

11 G. The Town's Findings are not based upon substantial evidence

12 62. The findings for the Statement of Overriding Considerations ("SOC") are not

13 supported by substantial evidence. The findings of fact and the CEQA findings are similarly

14 flawed, without substantial evidence to support the conclusions. NNNNNNNARONNA.O.....
15 63. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
16 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving
17 the Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set Aaoe

18 aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.
19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION AUNNOS
20 *Violation of General Plan Laws - "Government Code $$ 65300 et seq; Code of Civil Procedure 1085
21 64. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 63.
22 23 65. Respondent Town of Loomis must ensure that the Project approval is consistent
with the statement of policies in the Town's General Plan and any other applicable planning
24 document.
25 66. The State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et seq.,
26 establishes the General Plan as the constitution for all future development, to which any local
27 decision affecting land use and development must conform. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
28 Board of Supervisors, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 570.) Every city and county must adopt a
VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 16

I "comprehensive, long-tern General Plan for the physical development of the city or county ..."
Nm tndp (Gov't Code § 65300.) The California Supreme Court has described the General Plan as the -
*constitution for all future developments." (Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado
County v. Board of Supervisor ("FUTURE") (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336, citing
Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 570.) The Supreme
Court described "the function of a general plan as a "*constitution," and labeled it the "basic
land use charter governing the direction of future land use" in the locality. (Lesher
Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut (1950) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540, DaVita v. County of Napa

9 (1995) 9 Cal.3d 763, 773.) The propriety of an agency's decision affecting land use and

10 development depends on the project's consistency with the objectives, policies and land uses

-al 11 specified in the General Plan. (Gov't Code § 65860; Corona-Norco Unified School Dist. v.
12 City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.)

13 67. Local land use and development decisions must also be consistent with the

14 applicable general plan. (FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at 1336; Gov't Code, § 65860(a).)
15 The requirement that local land use decisions adhere to the governing General Plan is known -

16 as the "consistency doctrine." (Lesher Communications, Inc., supra, 9 Cal.3d at p. 541.) This --

17 doctrine is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws; it is the principle
-- 18 which infused the concept of planned growth with the force of law." (Ibid, citing deBottari v.

19 City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.) A project is consistent with the General

20 Plan if "it will further the objectives and policies of the General Plan and not obstruct their

21 attainment." (FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336; Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of

22 Vacaville (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 817.) While a court accords deference to an agency's

23 interpretation of its general plan and various elements, an abuse of discretion is established if

24 the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, its decision is not supported by
25 findings, or the findings are not supported by substantial evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., §

26 1094.5; Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1563.) A
27 project need not be in perfect conformity with each and every General Plan policy as no
28 project can completely satisfy every General Plan Policy. (Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Assn

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 17

N m t0N∞ V. City of Oakland (1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 719.) The Town, however, cannot ignore
General Plan goals, policies and objectives that are by their very terms fundamental,
mandatory and clear. An action, however, must be consistent with the very specific and
mandatory policies of the general plan. (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of
Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 785-786, 789; FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal App.4th at 1342.)
Thus, a project is inconsistent with the General Plan, and thus cannot be approved, where it
violates such a policy or policies. (Id.)

68.

9 policies: Project is not consistent with several of the Town's mandatory General Plan

10 a.

11 Natural Resource and Open Space Policy 1.e. mandates that the Town

12 prepare a carbon modeling analysis. The Towns failed to prepare the mandated analysis and

13 instead deferred this General Plan obligation to another agency.

b.

14 The Project fails to comply with Land Use Policy F.5, which states "New

15 commercial development shall preserve and integrate existing natural features (e.g. creeks,

16 native trees, rock outcrops) and topography into existing landscaping." The Town's addition

17 of "where feasible" is not part of the General Plan policy and not consistent with the

18 mandatory obligation set forth in the Policy.

69.

19 Under the Town's General Plan, arterial facilities serve to connect areas of major

20 activity within the urban area of Loomis and function primarily to distribute cross-town traffic -

21 from freeways/highways to collector streets. Within Loomis, arterial streets are mostly two

22 lane facilities with operating speeds ranging from 25 to 50 mph. (General Plan, at IV-6.)

70.

23 Brace Road is an east-west arterial from Sierra College Boulevard across 1-80 to

24 Horseshoe Bar Road. Brace Road has one lane in each direction. (Id. at IV-7.) "With the -..

25 exception of Sierra College Boulevard, none of the roadways within Loomis are posted as

26 truck routes." (Id. at IV-16.) "Brace Road has signs indicating truck weight restrictions."

27 (Id.) Nothing in the Final EIR or traffic study states whether the delivery trucks entering

28 Brace Road will be subject to the weight limits. There is nothing in the General Plan regarding

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -

18

- Brace Road nor on the weight limit sign indicating that such restrictions do not apply to the
N m t ro western portion of Brace Road.

71. As the Project is inconsistent with the fundamental and mandatory policies of the
General Plan, the Town's approval of the Project is contrary is to law and constitutes a
prejudicial abuse of discretion.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of City of Loomis Municipal Code § 17.37 Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

72. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, if as if set forth in full, each and every

g allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 71.

10 73. The Project does not include a zoning change for the parcels or portions of the

11 parcels zoned RH or RM-5 even though these parcels are part of the Project and will be used for

12 parking, which is not a permitted use in those zones. Table 2-2 in Loomis Municipal Code

13 section 13.24.040 sets forth the allowable land uses for residential zoning districts, including RM

14 and RH. (See also LMC, § 13.22.030.) Nothing in Table 2-2 identifies a parking lot for a

15 commercial project as an allowable use for residential districts. To the extent, similar and

16 compatible uses may be allowed within a zoning district, the director must make appropriate

17 findings as set forth in section 13.22.030(A)(3)(a). No such findings have been made.

18 Moreover, such findings of compatibility and consistency cannot be made.

19 74. The driveway entrance to the Project located on Brace Road is also located on land

20 zoned residential. Nothing in the zoning code provides that a driveway for a commercial center
21 constitutes an allowable use in a residential district. (See Table 2-2, LMC 13.24.040.)

22 75. The Project violates Loomis Municipal Code section 13.30.070(C)(4) which

23 provides: "Truck deliveries to a commercial or industrial parcel adjacent to a residential

24 zoning district shall be limited to the daylight hours unless the director authorizes other

25 delivery times based on the determination that there is either no feasible alternative, or there

26 are overriding transportation and traffic management benefits to scheduling deliveries at

27 night." (Emphasis added.)

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 19

75. The Project approvals restrict truck traffic at the Brace Road entrance between 10 eF pm 7 and 7 am. Those hours of operation violates section13.30.070(C)(4) as daylight hours
during the year. Also, nothing in section 13.30.070 defines daylight 7 hours as 7 am to 10 pm.

7 10 10N00 In fact, Table 3-4 discusses normal daylight hours for construction to between 7 am 7 to 7 pm
Monday through Friday 8 and 8 am to 7 pm between on Saturday.

76. As the Project is inconsistent with the requirements of the Zoning Code, the
Town's approval of the Project is contrary to law and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

discretion.

9 PRAYER

10 Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as -

11 follows:

12 I. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

13 and set aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project and to withdraw the
14 Notice of Determination for the Project;
