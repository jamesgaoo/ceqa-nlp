INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the June 3, 2020 decision of the County of San Diego and
3 its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "County" or "Respondents") to approve an amendment to
the Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 project (*Amended Project") proposed by
5 Real Party in Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company ("Jackson Pendo" or "Real
6 Party"). The Amended Project includes 1,266 housing units on nearly 600 acres of pristine San

7 Diego backcountry located between state and federal ecological preserves.

8 2. The County approved the proposed amendment to allow Jackson Pendo to
9 reconfigure the original Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 project ("Original
10 Project") to incorporate 200 acres of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve protected lands

11 owned by the people of California and managed by the California Department of Fish and
12 Wildlife ("CDFW")- -into its development. This reconfiguration was ostensibly to resolve
13 disputes with CDFW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS") regarding whether
14 other private, but protected, lands known as PV1, PV2, and PV3 could be developed as part of
15 the Original Project. While the Amended Project purports to ensure that PV1 and a portion of
16 PV3 will be protected, the County's June 3, 2020 approvals also include amendments to the
17 Multiple-Species Conservation Plan ("MSCP") to allow development of PV2 and a portion of
18 PV3 to proceed ("MSCP Amendment").
19 3. In approving the Amended Project, the County violated numerous state and local
20 laws, including the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the CEQA Guidelines,
21 State Planning and Zoning Law, the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act, and the
22 County's own General Plan. For example, the Amended Project relies on an Environmental
23 Impact Report ("EIR") prepared for the Original Project, which has been challenged in three
24 separate lawsuits in this Court. Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (San Diego Sup. Ct. Case
25 No. 37-2019-00038820-CU-TT-CTL) (lead case), consolidated with Endangered Habitats
26 League et al. v. County of San Diego et al. (San Diego Sup. Ct. Case No. 37-2019-00038672-
27 CU-TT-CTL) and Center for Biological Diversity et al. v. County of San Diego et al. (San Diego
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 | Sup. Ct. Case No. 37-2019-00038747-CU-WM-CTL). The flaws in the Original Project EIR
2 remain, and are directly relevant to the Amended Project and its potential impacts.

3 4. For example, the Amended Project is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity
4 Zone, with steep chaparral slopes, strong Santa Ana winds, and only one evacuation route.
5 Surprisingly, given the recent devastating fire seasons in California, the Original Project EIR did
6 little to disclose or analyze the increased wildfire risk that will be caused by bringing thousands
7 of people to this area. And it failed to accurately portray the significant risks associated with
8 relying on the two-lane Proctor Valley Road for mass evacuation, especially during a high-
9 speed, wind-driven fire. These issues will exacerbate fire risk and severity for existing County
10 residents, particularly those residing in Jamul and Chula Vista.

11 5. The Amended Project only adds to this risk, by adding even more new residents
12 that will also rely on Proctor Valley Road during a wildfire, increasing evacuation traffic by
13 thirteen percent. But rather than address this change with supplemental EIR, the County
14 prepared a conclusory Addendum, deleted relevant information from its underlying technical
15 documents, and promised the public-without adequate supportthat the Amended Project
16 would be safe.

17 6. The Amended Project also intensifies biological resource impacts. Both the
18 Original Project and the Amended Project are located in the middle of a key wildlife corridor
19 between protected and open space lands, including the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, San
20 Miguel Mountain, and Jamul Mountain. But the Amended Project incorporates 200 acres of land
21 previously protected within the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve and intensifies development
22 in this critical area. Of particular concern is the importance of this area for the federally
23 endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly. Rather than retain the protections for this critical
24 habitat, the Amended Project would add protections for portions of Planning Areas 16 and 19,
25 which contain large swaths of degraded habitat with thick invasive grasses that are not suitable
26 for long-term Quino viability.

27 7. For these and other reasons described below, the County's approval of the
28 Amended Project constituted an abuse of discretion and must be overturned.

PARTIES

2 8. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a is a tax-exempt non-profit
3 California corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable

4 land use and transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships

5 across Southern California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, now threatened by

6 climate change and the County's Amended Project approval. EHL is extremely active in the San
7 Diego region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological diversity in the area, and
8 served on the County advisory committee for the 2011 General Plan Update. EHL submitted

9 written comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the Amended Project.
10 9. Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity (the "Center") is a nonprofit
11 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
12 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has more than 70,000 members worldwide,
13 including members who reside within communities in the vicinity of the Amended Project. The
14 Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air and
15 water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated San Diego County
16 where the Amended Project is proposed. Members of the Center will be directly and adversely
17 affected by the Amended Project. The Center submitted written comments to the County
18 objecting to and commenting on the Amended Project.
19 10. Petitioner California Native Plant Society ("CNPS") is : California non-profit
20 501(c)(3) corporation. CNPS was founded in 1965 and currently has about 10,000 members in
21 35 chapters throughout California and Baja California. Its members include professional
22 botanists, landscape architects, nursery owners, professional conservation workers, agency
23 personnel, and laypersons. The members of CNPS are dedicated to the preservation of
24 California's rich native botanical heritage, the conservation of native plants and their natural
25 habitats (such as woodlands, chaparral, and wetlands), progress on issues that affect native
26 plants and people (such as wildfire and climate change), and advancement of the understanding,
27 appreciation, and horticultural use of native plants. CNPS works closely with decisionmakers,
28 scientists, and local planners to advocate for well-informed and environmentally friendly
5

Case No.

F policies, regulations, and land uses. CNPS submitted written comments to the County objecting
2 to and commenting on the Amended Project.

3 11. Petitioner Preserve Wild Santee ("PWS") is a volunteer community environmental

4 organization that has worked to protect and enhance the quality of life and preserve natural

5 resources in the City of Santee and adjoining areas since 1994. Preserve Wild Santee's members

6 offer input into local land use decisions in an effort to produce better development projects with
7 fewer environmental and fire safety impacts. PWS submitted written comments to the County
8 objecting to and commenting on the Amended Project.
12. Petitioner California Chaparral Institute ("CCI") is a nonprofit education, research, a
10 and advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of native shrubland habitats throughout
11 the West and supporting the creative spirit as inspired by nature. CCI submitted written
12 comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the Amended Project.
13 13. The interests that EHL, the Center, CNPS, PWS, and CCI (together, "Petitioners")
14 seek to further in this action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners

15 and their members have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with laws
16 bearing on approval of the Amended Project. These interests will be directly and adversely
17 affected by the Amended Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and which
18 would cause substantial harm to Petitioners' members, the natural environment, public health,
19 and the quality of life in the surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this
20 action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the
21 environmental and other harms alleged herein.

22 14. Respondent County of San Diego is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a
23 political subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and controlling land use
24 within the County, including but not limited to implementing and complying with the provisions
25 of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan, and the MSCP and
26 related plans and agreements. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public
27 Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental
28 review of proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and state law.
6

Case No.

15. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of San Diego is, and at all times
2 herein mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County. As the
3 decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors was charged with responsibilities under CEQA

4 for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the
5 various approvals necessary for the Amended Project. The Board also is and was responsible for
6 implementing and complying with the provisions of State Planning and Zoning Law, the

7 County's General Plan, and the MSCP and related plans and agreements. The Board and its
8 members are sued in their official capacities.

9 16. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents Does
10 through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe,
11 and on that basis allege, the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the actions
12 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
13 determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert
14 such identities and capacities.

15 17. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
16 Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the
17 entity listed as "Project Applicant" on the Notice of Determination filed for the Amended
18 Project on June 3, 2020. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real
19 Party in Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company is, and at all times herein mentioned
20 was, a California corporation doing business in San Diego County. As the applicant, Jackson
21 Pendo Development Company is a recipient of the approvals granted by Respondents as part of
22 the Amended Project, and thus is a real party in interest within the meaning of Public Resources
23 Code section 21167.6.5.

24 18. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
25 Interest GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P. is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a Delaware limited
26 partnership. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that GDCI Proctor
27 Valley, L.P. has an ownership interest in the property where the Amended Project will be
28 located and is listed as the "applicant" in the County's Addendum.

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 24. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,
3 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County

4 Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'

5 decision to approve the Amended Project and make related CEQA findings.

6 25. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California
7 in and for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394. The
8 activities authorized by Respondents will occur in San Diego County.
9 26. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central Division of the Superior Court
10 for the State of California for the County of San Diego. On information and belief, the Amended
11 Project is located in zip codes 91914 (South Division) and 91935 (East Division). However, as
12 this petition pleads a California Environmental Quality Act claim, venue is proper in the Central
13 Division pursuant to Local Rule 1.2.2(E).

14 27. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action
15 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
16 required by law. Petitioners and their members submitted numerous objections to approval of
17 the Amended Project based on inconsistencies with state law and the County's inadequate
18 analysis and mitigation of the Amended Project's environmental impacts in the CEQA
19 documentation prepared for the Amended Project.
20 28. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to approving the
21 Amended Project and making related CEQA findings. Respondents have a duty to comply with
22 applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary
23 approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
24 29. On July 1, 2020, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section
25 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file a
26 Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval of the Amended
27 Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.

28

Case No.

30. On July 2, 2020, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources Code section
2 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the
State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and

4 correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
31. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to

6 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will
file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.
32. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
9 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
10 their approval of the Amended Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals
11 will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their members will be
12 irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate
13 Petitioners and their members for that harm.

14 33. This petition is timely filed.

15 STATEMENT OF FACTS

16 I. Proctor Valley and the Proposed Site of the Amended Project

17 34. The Amended Project would be located in the remote Proctor Valley area of San
18 Diego County, northwest of the City of Chula Vista and near the small, unincorporated town of

19 Jamul. Apart from the dirt and gravel Proctor Valley Road, a designated scenic highway, the site
20| is entirely undeveloped. Travelers along Proctor Valley Road are treated with the undeveloped,

21 gentle hillsides of Proctor Valley, San Miguel Mountain and the Jamul Mountains, and the
22 dense trees and shrubs of Upper Otay Reservoir.

23 35. Proctor Valley is located at the crossroads of a wealth of biological resources. The
24 Amended Project site abuts the 5,600-acre Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, owned by CDFW,
25 to the west, north, and east. The Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve provides raptor foraging
26 habitat, host plants, and nectar resources for the endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly, habitat
27 occupied by the California gnatcatcher and San Diego fairy shrimp, burrowing owl locations,
28
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

and important habitat for numerous other special and protected species, including the mountain
2 lion.

3 36. Proctor Valley also provides the last remaining connection between the San Diego

4 National Wildlife Refugee and other protected open space in southern San Diego County. The
5 Wildlife Refuge is otherwise surrounded by development. As such, Proctor Valley and the
6 Amended Project site in particular provide a vital wildlife movement corridor for species
7 traveling between the protected habitat of San Miguel Mountain within the Wildlife Refuge to

8 the northwest and the Jamul Mountains to the southeast. CDFW has likewise recognized the
9 importance of water sources in Proctor Valley for wildlife migration between these two areas.
10 37. The Amended Project site itself supports numerous sensitive natural vegetation
11 communities including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian, and vernal pools. Based on the
12 applicant's data, 22 special-status plants and 27 special-status wildlife species occur in the
13 Amended Project area, including the federally endangered San Diego fairy shrimp and Quino
14 checkerspot butterfly, the federally threatened California gnatcatcher, the federally
15 threatened/state endangered Otay tarplant, the state fully protected Golden Eagle and white-
16 tailed kite, and the federal candidate western spadefoot toad. The Amended Project site is not
17 only replete with sensitive flora and fauna; it provides some of the County's last best habitat for
18 many of these species.
19 38. For instance, Proctor Valley contains key habitat for the federally endangered
20 Quino checkerspot butterfly, a small orange-and-black butterfly that was once one of the most
21 common butterflies in Southern California but is now on the verge of extinction. Proctor Valley
22 connects vital habitat areas for the Quino checkerspot butterfly--San Miguel Mountain and
23 Otay Mountain and contains significant habitat itself, including host plants and nectar sources.
24 After the wet winters of 2017 and 2018, limited observations revealed over 50 Quino
25 checkerspot butterfly on and near the Amended Project site.
26 39. In addition, recent observations and USGS tracking data show that federally listed
27 Golden Eagles frequently travel through Proctor Valley and forage on the Amended Project site.
28 Recent scientific literature indicates that Golden Fagles are particularly sensitive to
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 development houses, roads, and infrastructure all can cause Golden Eagles to vacate nearby
2 areas. Development in Proctor Valley would almost certainly result in the loss of important
3 eagle foraging habitat and the San Miguel Mountain/Rancho San Diego eagle territory,
4 shrinking available habitat in San Diego County significantly.

5 40. The western spadefoot toad, a state species of special concern that is not covered
6 by existing take authorization under the MSCP, is also present in Proctor Valley. This brown

7 and green amphibian requires shallow, temporary pools or streams during breeding season; the

8 Amended Project site contains at least 12 such breeding pools.
41. Proctor Valley contains a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone designated by the
10 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the California Public Utilities
11 Commission, the highest fire risk designation in California. This highest designation is well
12 deserved, as the area has burned at least 17 times in the last 100 years. The most notable fire-
13 the 2007 Harris Fire-burned over 90,000 acres, including a large portion of the Amended
14 Project site, and resulted in numerous fatalities.
15 42. Proctor Valley is uniquely at risk for fast-moving, wind-driven fires. According to
16 fire experts, a fire ignited on the Amended Project site under Santa Ana winds would likely
17 spread southwest towards population centers at a rate of several miles per hour. The City of
18 Chula Vista's nearest residential development is less than 1.5 miles away. The steep terrain
19 surrounding the Amended Project site, vegetated by chaparral and coastal scrub, would make
20 effective fire suppression difficult. The County acknowledges that the Amended Project would
21 be served by only one evacuation route the planned two-lane Proctor Valley Road.

22 43. A quick glance at a map reveals that the Amended Project is located far from job

23 centers and other services. Downtown Chula Vista is nearly 30 minutes away by car and is
24 already suffering from a shortage of jobs for current residents. The City of San Diego is nearly
25 an hour away. It comes as no surprise that the County forecasts that future Amended Project
26 residents will drive 50 million miles per year in order to access these jobs and other goods and
27 services. The Amended Project represents the precise type of status quo, backcountry

development that the Executive Director of the San Diego Association of Governments said

2 cannot achieve state climate goals.
3  II. Applicable Land Use Plans

4 A. San Diego County General Plan

5 44. On October 28, 1993, the County approved the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan, as
6 part of the County's General Plan. The Subregional Plan establishes land uses for the nearly
7 23,000-acre Otay Ranch. The Subregional Plan generally designates Village 14 and Planning
8 Areas 16/19 for development but acknowledges that project-level development approvals cannot

9 occur until after the County considers and addresses site-specific concerns related to such
10 development. While other areas covered by the Subregional Plan have been developed in the
11 decades since 1993, Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 have not.
12 45. In the 2011 General Plan, the County committed to preparing a climate change
13 action plan with detailed greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and deadlines and
14 comprehensive and enforceable greenhouse gas emissions reduction measures to achieve
15 specified quantities of emission reductions. As mitigation for the harm to the climate from
16 greenhouse gas emissions that would be caused by development anticipated by the General Plan,
17 the County adopted Mitigation Measure CC-1.2, which requires the preparation of a County
18 Climate Change Action Plan ("CAP"). On June 20, 2012, the County adopted a CAP and
19 thresholds for determining the significance of greenhouse gas emissions for CEQA purposes.
20 This approval was successfully challenged by the Sierra Club.
21 46. In response, on February 14, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors adopted a
22 Revised CAP, and associated EIR. The mitigation and monitoring program adopted by the
23 County pursuant to the Revised Cap's EIR included mitigation measure M-GHG-1, which
24 required certain projects to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing carbon offsets.
25 Sierra Club again challenged those approvals. On June 12, 2020, the California Court of Appeal
26 again granted the Sierra Club's petition to set aside the Revised CAP and mitigation measure M-
27 GHG-1, finding in part that the County's plan to largely rely on carbon offsets to address
28
13

Case No.

emissions from sprawl projects contained unenforceable performance standards and improperly
2 deferred and delegated mitigation.
47. In 2016, the state passed SB 1000, which requires counties to adopt an
4 environmental justice element in their general plans "upon the adoption or next revision of two
5 or more elements concurrently on or after January 1, 2018." In September 2018, the County

6 approved the Newland Sierra project, which included concurrent revisions to the Mobility
7 Element and the Land Use Element. The County also adopted other revisions to the General
8 Plan throughout 2018. However, the County has not yet adopted an environmental justice

9 element.

10 B. Multiple Species Conservation Program ("MSCP")

11 48. In response to ongoing threats to federally and state listed endangered species and
12 continued development pressures, CDFW (then, the California Department of Fish and Game)
13 and USFWS approved an MSCP Subregional Plan for San Diego County. The MSCP is a joint
14 Habitat Conservation Plan under federal law and Natural Community Conservation Plan under
15 state law. The MSCP established comprehensive, regional mechanisms to ensure the survival
16 and recovery of certain federally and state listed species while providing the County with limited
17 "take" authorization pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. section 1531 et
18 seq., and the California Endangered Species Act, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq.
19 Notably, the Amended Project site contains many sensitive species, including the Quino
20 checkerspot butterfly and the western spadefoot toad, that the MSCP does not cover.
21 49. To implement the MSCP in the vicinity of the Amended Project, the County and
22 the City of Chula Vista worked with CDFW and USFWS to prepare MSCP Subarea Plans. The
23 Amended Project is located within the "South County Segment" of the County's Subarea Plan.
24 50. CDFW approved the County's take permit pursuant to the Natural Community
25 Conservation Program Act (Fish and Game § Code § 2800 et seq.) on March 17, 1998. The
26 County also entered into an "Implementing Agreement" with CDFW and USFWS to establish
27 the agencies' roles and responsibilities for carrying out the MSCP and Subarea Plan.

Case No.

51. The MSCP and the Subarea Plan include an open space preserve system that
2 differs from the one originally approved by the County as part of the County's General Plan
3 (specifically, in the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan). As part of a compromise with the County

4 and the original Otay Ranch developer, the MSCP expanded the preserve system to include
5 approximately 200 acres of central Proctor Valley (known as areas PV1, PV2, and PV3) in

6 exchange for allowing for increased development in other areas. PV1, PV2, and PV3 were
7 designated in the Subarea Plan as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take
8 Permits' Will be Issued, " and were identified in the MSCP Subregional Plan and its EIR as

9. 9 "100 percent conserved," meaning such lands fall within the designated "Hardline Preserve"
10 area. In exchange, the MSCP allowed significantly increased residential density in Otay Ranch
11 Villages 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11, which the City of Chula Vista subsequently developed.
12 C. Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy
13 52. The San Diego Association of Government ("SANDAG") is the federally
14| designated regional agency directing overall transportation infrastructure funding. Every four
15 years it prepares a Regional Transportation Plan ("RTP") for the entire County of San Diego.
16 After the enactment of SB 375 (Govt. Code § 65080 et seq.), SANDAG has been required to
17 also prepare a Sustainable Community Strategy ("SCS"), setting out means for using
18 transportation projects and funding to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, and in
19 particular to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from driving. The RTP and SCS are a combined
20 plan that is applicable to the entire County, with numerous policies intended to ensure the
21 County effectively addresses climate change impacts from transportation and land use by
22 planning in a manner that limits sprawl and reduces vehicle miles traveled.
23 III. History of the Village 14 Project.
24 53. On November 15, 2016, Jackson Pendo submitted an application for the Original
25 Project. A sprawling residential community, the Original Project included 1,119 single-family
26 homes and "ranchettes," 10,000 square feet of commercial space, and associated development
27 on a 1,284-acre site. Discretionary approvals associated with the Original Project included
28 amendments to the San Diego County General Plan Land Use Element and Mobility Element,
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 the combined Otay Ranch Development Plan/Otay Subregional Plan, a specific plan, a zone
2 reclassification, and a tentative map.

3 54. On March 1, 2018, the County released a draft environmental impact report

4 ("DEIR") for the Original Project. The analysis contained in the DEIR was deeply flawed. For
5 instance, despite Proctor Valley's significant ecological importance and the numerous sensitive

6 species that the Original Project would harm, the DEIR concluded that all impacts to biological

7 resources would be less than significant. Similarly, despite the extreme fire risk at the Original
8 Project site and the foreseeable ignition and evacuation risks that the Original Project would

9 create, the DEIR concluded that these impacts would be less than significant as well.

10 55. Petitioners and numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals

11 commented on the DEIR and voiced concern over the County's inadequate environmental
12 review. For instance, CDFW submitted extensive comments on the proposed Original Project's
13 conflict with the MSCP and associated documents and the Original Project's likely adverse
14 impacts on many special status plants and animals. The San Diego Association of Governments
15 also submitted a comment letter questioning whether the proposed Original Project was
16 consistent with land use principles that preserve natural resources and limit urban sprawl, such
17 as those found in the General Plan, Climate Action Plan, and RTP/SCS.

18 56. Petitioners submitted extensive comments on the DEIR. These comments

19 included:

20 a. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze, mitigate, and avoid direct, indirect,
21  and cumulative impacts to sensitive biological resources, including the western spadefoot toad,
22 the Quino checkerspot butterfly, Otay tarplant, and the Golden Eagle.

23 b. The DEIR relied on flawed surveys for many biological resources,
24 including inappropriate survey periods for the Quino checkerspot butterfly and numerous
25 sensitive plant species, and on excessively fast field surveys that could not possibly identify
26 many of the small sensitive plants that likely occupy the Original Project site. The DEIR further
27 misidentifies high-value sensitive coastal sage scrub communities on the Original Project site as
28 degraded.
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

C. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze, mitigate, and avoid climate change
2 impacts. For example, the DEIR a relies extensively on a carbon offset program to purportedly
3 reduce climate change impacts to a less-than-significant level. However, the carbon offset
4 program is riddled with problems, including its allowance of out-of-county offsets, its reliance

5 on offset programs that may be ineffective or unenforceable, and its inclusion of a provision that

6 allows the applicant to ratchet down the required number of offsets.

7 d. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze the Original Project's consistency
8 with the San Diego Association of Government's RTP/SCS, which is intended to reduce VMT

9 and promote more compact development.

10 e. The DEIR does not adequately analyze the impacts due to increased
11 wildfire risk, or the effects on evacuation, created by bringing thousands of new people and
12 significant development to an undeveloped area, and fails to mitigate or avoid such impacts. For
13 instance, the DEIR relies on faulty modeling assumptions and inaccurate or incomplete
14 information and therefore incorrectly concludes that the Original Project-which is in a Very
15 High Fire Hazard Severity Zone- -will result in less-than-significant wildfire impacts. In
16 addition, the County's wildfire evacuation plan relies on wildly optimistic assumptions,
17 incorrect information, and flawed traffic modeling; even with these errors, the technical
18 appendix still reveals that the evacuation plan will not always work.
19 f The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Original
20 Project's direct and cumulative impacts on water supply. The DEIR assumes that the relevant
21 water agencies will have sufficient water for the Original Project; however, available evidence
22 indicates that the San Diego region will face a significant water shortageexacerbated by the
23 Original Project and other cumulative projects-in the long term.
24 g. The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Original
25 Project's water quality impacts, especially on Jamul Creek and Lower Otay Reservoirs, both
26 impaired water bodies.

27 h. The DEIR's analysis of energy impacts ignores the inefficient and wasteful
28 use of gasoline and diesel fuel necessitated by the Original Project's far-flung location.
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

i. The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Original

2 Project's aesthetic impacts, particularly for motorists on Proctor Valley Road (a designated
3 scenic highway), visitors to nearby trails and recreation areas, and for area nighttime views.

4 j. The DEIR's analysis of alternatives violates CEQA. The DEIR does not
5 consider a reasonable range of alternatives, instead setting up a fictitious straw-man alternative
a 6 and a land exchange alternative that increases rather than decreases the Original Project's

7 significant impacts. It also fails to adequately evaluate an off-site alternative.

8 k. Finally, Petitioners noted that given the significant flaws, CEQA required

9 the EIR to be recirculated for additional public comment prior to bringing the Original Project
10 forward to the Board of Supervisors.

11 57. In the months following the release of the DEIR, Petitioners provided additional
12 comments as new issues arose.

13 a. For instance, on July 24, 2018, EHL submitted a letter to the County
14 regarding the potential cumulative impacts-including air quality, wildfire risk, greenhouse gas
15 emissions, and energy consumption- -resulting from the approval of Village 14 in conjunction
16 with the approval or potential future approval of nine other major residential projects totaling
17 nearly 15,000 residential units. Not one of these units is restricted as affordable.

18 b. This letter also objected to the County's record retention policy. Petitioners
19 are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, throughout the administrative process
20 for the Original Project, the Amended Project, and other projects, the County used a document
21 management system that automatically, and unlawfully, deleted e-mails and other records after

22 60 days, including e-mails and records related to the Original Project and the Amended Project
23 that are required to be included in the administrative record for this case.

24 58. In September 2018, the County released the Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Original
25 Project. Despite the significant and fundamental flaws identified in the DEIR, the FEIR
26 contained only limited revisions.

27 59. In early November 2018, the town of Paradise, California suffered a catastrophic,
28 wind-driven wildfire that took the lives of 85 people. News reports highlighted the difficulty of
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

evacuating in a fast-moving conflagration and the ineffectiveness of fire hardening, defensible
2 space, and shelter-in-place plans. On December 5, 2018, EHL requested a reassessment of the
3 County's approach for Village 14, considering the information emerging from Paradise.

4 60. On June 12, 2019, just two weeks before the scheduled hearing, the County
5 a released a new version of the FEIR. The County had made substantive modifications to EIR

6 sections on Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Transportation and Traffic as well as to the
7 proposed mitigation measures and the County's response to public comments.

8 61. On June 19, 2019, EHL submitted comments on these new documents, outlining
9 the continued flaws in the County's FEIR. The letter addressed the County's response to EHL's
10 submission on the DEIR by providing additional information, expert testimony, and legal
11 argument, and explaining why the County's responses to comments were inadequate. The letter
12 responded to new issues raised by the County's responses and/or revisions. For example,
13 a. The FEIR incorrectly suggests that the voluntary carbon offsets proposed as
14 mitigation have been "approved" by the California Air Resources Board.
15 b. The FEIR erroneously calculates and proposes mitigation for only the first
16 30 years of emissions, even though the residences and infrastructure will have a much longer
17  lifespan.

18 C. The FEIR's revision to its analysis of impacts to western spadefoot toad
19 reveal that the Original Project will destroy more breeding pools than disclosed in the DEIR.
20 Rather than addressing this new impact or addressing the original flaws in the analysis, the FEIR
21 falsely concludes that Original Project impacts remain less than significant.
22 d. The FEIR fails to consider new information related to the ineffectiveness of
23 hardscaping, fire-resistant structures, and evacuation plans in wind-driving wildfires. Instead,
24 the FEIR continues to maintain that the Fire Protection Plan and Wildfire Evacuation Plan-
25 which rely almost exclusively on these techniques-will be sufficient to address all potential
26 impacts from wildfire.
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 19

Case No.

e. The FEIR rejects the Alternative Site Location- which would reduce
2 several the Original Project's significant impacts as infeasible without adequate analysis or

3 substantial evidence.

4 f. The Original Project does not include any affordable housing, contrary to
5 the requirements found in the County's General Plan.

6 62. On or around June 19, 2019, just one week before the hearing, the County released
7 significant new information about the Original Project. For instance, the agenda and staff report

8 indicated that in addition to the Original Project analyzed in the EIR, the County would also be
9 considering approval of a "Dispute Resolution Agreement" with Jackson Pendo, CDFW and
10 USFWS, which would obligate the County and the agencies to facilitate approval of an entirely
11 new project, which had never been disclosed to the public or analyzed under CEQA, and which
12 would allow development of PV-2, portions of PV-3, and a portion of the Rancho Jamul
13 Ecological Reserve, currently owned by the State. This new project would become the Amended
14 Project.

15 63. On June 26, 2019, the Board voted 3-2 to approve the Original Project. The Board
16 also approved the Dispute Resolution Agreement, which contractually committed CDFW to the
17 Amended Project and set forth the procedures for the County and the USFWS to process it.

18 64. Pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Agreement, Jackson Pendo and CDFW
19 submitted an application to the County for the Amended Project on November 14, 2019. The
20 requested approvals included, among other things, a Specific Plan Amendment (to incorporate
21 200 acres of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve into the development area), a revised vesting
22 tentative map (to subdivide the Amended Project area into 1,266 lots), and an amendment to the

23 MSCP (to allow development of PV-2 and a portion of PV-3 and to provide project-specific
24 incidental take authorization for the Quino checkerspot butterfly and the San Diego fairy
25 shrimp).

26 65. On January 14, 2020, the Jamul/Dulzura Community Planning Group considered

27 the Amended Project. The motion to recommend approval of the Amended Project failed.

28
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 66. Between January 2, 2020 and February 17, 2020, the County released an
2 Addendum for public comment. The Addendum concluded that the EIR prepared for the
3 Original Project remained in compliance with CEQA and could be relied on for the Amended

4 Project. It also concluded that the Amended Project involved no changes to the Original Project

5 or the surrounding circumstances that would require preparation of a supplemental EIR.

6 67. EHL, the Center, and CNPS submitted comments letters on Addendum. Among
7 other concerns, these comment letters pointed out that:
8 a. CEQA does not permit a lead agency to rely on an Addendum to cure legal
9 deficiencies in a certified EIR.

10 b. Reliance on the Original Project EIR, which has been challenged due to its
11 clear inadequacies under CEQA, would subject the Amended Project to the same legal risks as
12 the Original Project.

13 C. The Amended Project would result in significant impacts to transportation,
14 air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy that would be substantially more severe than
15 the Original Project, necessitating the preparation of a supplemental EIR.
16 d. By incorporating a significant portion of the Rancho Jamul Ecological
17 Reserve into the development footprint, the Amended Project would result in significant
18 biological resource impacts not previously disclosed in the Original Project EIR.
19 68. On April 3, 2020, the Planning Commission voted 5-1 to recommend approval of
20 the Amended Project.

21 69. On May 27, 2020, EHL submitted additional comments to the Board of
22 Supervisors concerning the Amended Project and the County's release of additional technical
23 appendices. Among other concerns, the comments noted that:
24 a. The Addendum and associated Fire Safety Memorandum failed to
25 demonstrate that the Amended Project would not be a source of human-caused ignitions that
26 would significantly increase fire risk in the area.
27 b. The Addendum and associated Fire Evacuation Plan fail to address the
28 Amended Project's risk of exposing people to fire evacuation hazards, including by deleting
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Casc No.

P critical information on evacuation of Proctor Valley, ignoring the impact of the Amended
2 Project's additional traffic, and excluding consideration of concurrent use of Proctor Valley

3 Road by residents of Jamul and the Amended Project site.

4 C. The Addendum does not provide information necessary to understand the
5 increased severity of biological impacts that would occur from developing the Rancho Jamul
6 Ecological Reserve in lieu of lower quality habitat on Planning Areas 16 and 19.

7 d. The Addendum does not demonstrate that the Amended Project's
8 modifications to biological resource mitigation measures-including measures intended to

9 protect the Quino checkerspot butterfly-would effectively reduce impacts to a less-than-
10 significant level.

11 e. The County continues to rely on unenforceable and ineffective mitigation

12 for the Amended Project's significant greenhouse gas emissions, including a carbon offset

13 program that lacks objective performance standards, impermissibly delegates implementation to
14 County staff, and requires mitigation for only thirty years of operational greenhouse gas

15 emissions, while the lifespan of the Amended Project is far longer.
16 f. The Amended Project remains inconsistent with the County's Climate
17 Action Plan and General Plan requirements for greenhouse gas emission reduction, which
18 requires reductions in emissions to occur within San Diego County.

19 g. The Amended Project remains inconsistent with the San Diego Association

20 of Governments' Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities Strategy and
21 California's science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and goals.

22 h. The Addendum lacks evidentiary support for its conclusion that the
23 Amended Project would not result in an inefficient or wasteful use of energy.

24 70. In the few days prior to the June 3, 2020 hearing, the County continued to release
25 additional responses, analyses, and modifications to the Amended Project, including the
26 proposed amendment to the MSCP.
27 71. On June 2, 2020, EHL submitted additional comments responding to a late-
28 released fire evacuation report and the MSCP Amendment. The comments raised concerns that
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 the County unlawfully failed to evaluate the Amended Project in light of the previous
2 environmental review completed for the MSCP and that the proposed MSCP Amendment for
3 the Quino checkerspot butterfly, which authorize project-specific take, are inconsistent with
4 MSCP requirements for landscape and ecosystem level protection for covered species. The letter

5 also noted that while the County's tentative map conditions purported to address concerns about
6 the County's ability to enforce the carbon offset geographic preferences, the condition only
7 applies to 12 percent of the Amended Project's units. Other comments raised the concern that
8 the MSCP Amendment conflicted with MSCP requirements.

9 72. On June 2, 2020, the Center submitted comments on the Amended Project,
10 highlighting the Addendum's inadequate study of potential impacts to sensitive biological
11 resources, including the Crotch bumblebee, a species newly listed by a CDFW as a candidate
12 species under the California Endangered Species Act. The comments also explained that the
13 MSCP Amendment fails to satisfy the criteria set forth in section 10 of the federal Endangered
14 Species Act for Habitat Conservation Plans.
15 73. On June 3, 2020, the Board considered the Amended Project, including the
16 Specific Plan Amendment (PDS2019-SPA-19-001), the Revised Vesting Tentative Map
17 (PDS2019-VTM-5616R) and Site Plan (PSD2019-STP-19-029), the MSCP Amendment, and
18 CEQA findings. At the hearing, the Board also approved the Applicant's last-minute changes to
19 the Amended Project's greenhouse gas mitigation measures and added a condition to the Site
20 Plan that "requires future homeowners to be notified, prior to occupancy, that they are
21 purchasing a home in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone." The Board voted to approve the
22 Amended Project 4-1. The effectiveness of the Amended Project approvals is contingent on the
23 Wildlife Conservation Board's ultimate approval of CDFW's intended transfer of a portion of
24 the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve to Jackson Pendo.

(Public Resources Code $ 21000 et seq;

76. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs

8

9 CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal of
long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the environment.

10 foreseeable change in the environment.
11 CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a reasonably

77. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires the lead
12 agency for a project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an
13 EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the
14 requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR
15 must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can intelligently
16 consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project. Such analysis must
17 include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial evidence in the

18 record.

19 78. Additionally, the EIR must identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or
20 avoid the project's significant environmental impacts, as well as analyze a reasonable range of
21 alternatives to the project. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible
22 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental
23 impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant
24 level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving project if a feasible alternative is
25 available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant
26 environmental impacts.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No. 24

79. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency maÿ approve a project that would have
2 significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
3 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

4 80. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must

5 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. State law

6 further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
7 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

8 81. CEQA requires agencies to prepare a supplemental EIR where (a) substantial

9 changes are proposed to the project; (b) substantial changes occur in the circumstances under
10 which the project is to be undertaken; or (c) new information of substantial importance emerges.
11 The CEQA Guidelines require the preparation of a supplemental EIR when these changes result
12 in new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously
13 identified significant effects. Any decision not to prepare a supplemental EIR must be supported
14 by substantial evidence.
15 82. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
16 by approving an Addendum for the Amended Project that is inadequate and fails to comply with
17 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
18 83. The Addendum relies on an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with the
19 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. That EIR is currently being challenged in
20 three separate lawsuits in this Court. See Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (San Diego Sup.
21 Ct. Case No. 37-2019-00038820-CU-TT-CTL) (lead case), consolidated with Endangered
22 Habitats League et al. v. County of San Diego et al. (San Diego Sup. Ct. Case No. 37-2019-
23 00038672-CU-TT-CTL) and Center for Biological Diversity et al. v. County of San Diego et al.
24 (San Diego Sup. Ct. Case No. 37-2019-00038747-CU-WM-CTL). If this Court determines that
25 the Original Project EIR is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA, the
26 Addendum is necessarily inadequate as well and the Amended Project approvals must be
27 rescinded.

28
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

84. The inadequacies in the County's analysis in both the Original Project EIR and the
2 Addendum include, but are not limited to, failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the
3 following impacts:

4 a. Biological resources, including special status species;

5 b. Fire safety;

6 C. Climate change/greenhouse gases;

7 d. Air quality;

8 e. Water supply;

f. Water quality/hydrology;

10 g. Energy consumption;

11 h. Aesthetics;

12 i Traffic; and

13 j. Land Use.

14 85. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
15 by failing to prepare a supplemental EIR. The requirements for a supplemental EIR are met
16 here. First, the Amended Project is significantly different from the Original Project. For
17 instance, the Amended Project includes 200 acres of lands that are currently owned by the public
18 and protected by CDFW as part of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve. These lands have
19 greater biological value than the lands that will be protected as part of the Amended Project. In
20 addition, the Amended Project includes additional housing units that will create new significant
21 impacts and/or exacerbate the severity of existing significant impacts, including with respect to
22 transportation, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and fire safety. Finally, the
23 Amended Project includes amendments to the MSCP, the impacts of which were not adequately
24 analyzed in the Original Project EIR.

25 86. Second, substantial changes have occurred with respect to the circumstances under
26 which the Amended Project will be undertaken that necessitate revisions to the Original Project
27 EIR. For instance, additional biological observations in the area indicate the presence of habitats

28 and species previously not found on the site. Likewise, the legal landscape has changed since the
26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 Original Project EIR was certified, including with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and

2 energy use.

3 87. Third, new information regarding the Amended Project and its potential impacts

4 has become available. For instance, since the Original Project EIR was certified, new
5 information has emerged regarding potential impacts to the Crotch bumblebee from
6 development on the site. Likewise, additional information about the ability of project residents
7 to safely evacuate during wildfire has been made available by the County and the Applicant.
8 Such information was not known and could not have been known with the Original Project EIR
9 was developed and indicates that new or more severe impacts will occur.
10 88. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
11 by approving an Addendum that includes an inadequate and inaccurate description of the
12 environmental setting of the Amended Project area.
13 89. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
14 by approving an Addendum that relies on an inadequate, inaccurate, and unstable description the
15 Amended Project.
16 90. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
17 by approving an Addendum that fails to adequately consider the cumulative and growth-
18 inducing impacts of the Amended Project.
19 91. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
20 by approving an Addendum that relies on ineffective, unenforceable, unproven, and/or
21 improperly deferred mitigation measures to reduce the Amended Project's impacts, including
22 mitigation for greenhouse gas impacts, wildfire impacts, and impacts to biological resources.
23 Respondents also violated CEQA by modifying or ignoring previously adopted mitigation
24 measures without following the procedure established by CEQA.
25 92. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to consider feasible project alternatives
26 that would have reduced significant impacts while still meeting project objectives and by
27 improperly rejecting certain alternatives. Similarly, Respondents violated CEQA by adopting
28| overly narrow project objectives.

93. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter
2 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record and do not provide
3 adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by law.

4 94. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
5 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving an Addendum,
6 making findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA.
7 As such, Respondents' approval of the Addendum and the Amended Project must be set aside.

99. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to
2 adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan serves as a
3 charter for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform. DeVita v.
4 County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773.

5 100. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth "should be
6 guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan.' Government Code

7 section 65300.5 requires that the local general plan be "integrated, internally consistent and

8 compatible." Courts have held that land use decisions must be consistent with the general plan.
9 Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806. State
10 Planning and Zoning Law requires compliance with all General Plan policies that are
11 "fundamental, mandatory, and specific." Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County v.
12 Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1342; Spring Valley Lake Assn V. City of
13 Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 100-101.

14 101. The County violated the requirements of state law by approving a project that is
15 inconsistent with the requirements of the County's General Plan. For example, and as described
16 above, the Amended Project is inconsistent policies requiring that carbon offset projects be
17 located in the County. These policies include but are not limited to Goal COS-20 and Policy
18 COS-20.1.

19 102. SB 1000 (2016) also requires the County to adopt an "environmental justice
20 element, or the environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives in other elements" in 2018
21  after it amends two or more elements of its General Plan. The County amended its General Plan
22 more than twice in 2018, but it has failed to adopt an environmental justice element or
23 environmental goals and policies in its General Plan. Until it does so, the County lacks a legally
24 adequate General Plan. Thus, the County's approval of the Amended Project in reliance on the
25 General Plan is unlawful.

26 103. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
27 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Amended
28 Project, making findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the County's
29

Case No.

P General Plan and State Planning and Zoning Law. As such, Respondents' approval of the

2 Amended Project must be set aside.

3 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violation of NCCP Act, MSCP, Related Plans and Agreements - Against All Respondents

5 (Fish and Game Code $ 2800 et seq.; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

6 104. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
7 in their entirety.

8 105. CDFW approved the MSCP, a natural community conservation plan, for the
9 region in which the Amended Project is located, pursuant to the Natural Community
10 Conservation Plan Act, Fish and Game Code section 2800 et seq. ("NCCP Act"). The MSCP
11 includes both a Subarca Plan and an Implementing Agreement with the County. Pursuant to
12 these documents, CDFW approved the County's incidental take permit on March 17, 1998.

13 106. The County's approval of the Amended Project includes amendments to the
14 MSCP. These amendments are unlawful, including for the following reasons:

15 a. The MSCP Amendments include project-specific take authorization for the
16 Quino checkerspot butterfly and the San Diego fairy shrimp. However, pursuant to the NCCP
17 Act and the MSCP, the MSCP must include landscape and ecosystem level protection for
18 covered species. A project-specific take authorization does not satisfy this requirement.

19 b. The MSCP Amendments do not comply with the terms of the MSCP itself,
20| which permit amendments only in limited circumstances, such circumstances were not met here.

21 107. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
22 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Amended
23 Project, including the MSCP Amendment. As such, Respondents' approval of the Amended
24 Project must be set aside.

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
27 1. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and set
28 aside all Amended Project approvals, including the Addendum and the MSCP Amendment;

6 injunctions restraining the County and Real Party in Interest and their agents, servants, and

10 authority;
