Petitioner

VERIFIED PETITION FOR V.
WRIT OF MANDATE 13

DISTRICT, and DOES 1 through 20; [Action Contains Claims Under the California Environmental
Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code, 16
Respondents § 21000 et seq.l 17

18
19 1. By this action, Petitioner Mound Farms challenges Respondents California

20 Department of General Services; California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"); and

21 Westlands Water District's ("Westlands") approval of Agreement Number 460012954 between

22 Department of Water Resources and Westlands Water District (the "Agreement"). The

23 Agreement provides in part for the modification of water rights held by Sweetwater Company, a|

24 mutual water company ("Sweetwater Company"), to support the construction and

25 implementation of the Lower Yolo Ranch Restoration Project (the "Project") on certain lands

26 owned by Westlands. The Sweetwater Company's water rights are also relied upon by Mound

27 Farms for its property and restoration efforts.

28

2. In approving the Agreement, Respondents did not comply with the California
v w N Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, section 21000 and the CEQA Guidelines,
Title 14 California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq. Although in 2013, the State &
Federal Contractors Water Agency prepared and certified the Final Environmental Impact * t.. ---d.m

5 Report for the Project and in 2018 Westlands approved an Addendum to the Final

6 I Environmental Impact Report for the Project, neither environmental document addressed or

7 discussed modification of Sweetwater Company's water rights for the Project nor the potentially |

8 significant environmental impacts such modifications may have on the other users of

9 Sweetwater Company's water rights or other water rights holders in the Yolo Basin. In fact, the

10 Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project specifically provided that changes to the

[1 water rights of Sweetwater Company would not occur as a result of the Project.

12 3. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the

13 Agreement Number 4600012954 is invalid and void as the Respondents failed to satisfy the

14 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

15 PARTIES

16 4. Petitioner Mound Farms is a California corporation that owns and operates Mound

17 Farms, constituting approximately 725 acres, located in the southern Yolo Bypass, 16 miles

18 south of the City of Davis. in the County of Yolo. A significant portion of Mound Farms was

19 restored in 2013 utilizing funds made available through the Federal Wetlands Reserve Program.

20 The lands of Mound Farms are bordered by the lands of Respondent Westlands on the southern,

21 western and eastern sides, and together Petitioner and Respondent Westlands own all of the

22 outstanding shares of Sweetwater Company.

23 5. Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that

24 Respondents comply with the laws relating to environmental protection, particularly CEQA.

25 Petitioner is affected by Respondents' failure to prepare a legally adequate supplemental

26 environmental document for the Project.

27 6. Respondent Westlands is a governmental agency and political subdivision of the

28 State of California. As lead agency for the Project, Westlands is responsible for preparation of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary
evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to substantially lessen or avoid any significant
environmental impacts.
1010000 7. Respondent California Department of General Services is a governmental agency - -
that serves as the business manager for the State of California and oversees and approves
agreements entered into by State agencies, including the California Department of Water

Resources.

8

9 Respondent DWR is a governmental agency and political subdi vision of the State

10 of California charged with planning. designing, constructing, operating, maintaining and

I1 overseeing the State Water Project ("SWP"), and pursuant to the Agreement would acquire the

12 property constituting the Project and receive a portion of the water rights currently owned by
Sweetwater Company (not merely an entitlement to water from Sweetwater Company). --

13 9.

14 Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as ---.a

15 Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent Does

16 1-20, inclusive, are indi viduals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the 4h

17 Project or by Respondents' actions with respect to the Project. When the true identities and

18 capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if

19 necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.
BACKGROUND FACTS

20 10.

21 The United States Fish and Wildlife Services' ("USFWS") 2008 Delta Smelt

22 Biological Opinion's Reasonable and Prudent Alternative 4 requires DWR to create or restore a

23 minimum of 8,000 acres of intertidal and associated subtidal wetland habitat with the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta") and Suisun March.

24 11.

25 The National Marine Fisheries Service ("'NMFS") 2009 Salmonid Biological

26 Opinion ("Salmon BiOp") Reasonable and Prudent Alternative Action 1.6.1 requires DWR, in

27 conjunction with the United States Bureau of Reclamation (*USBR") to restore between 17,000

28 to 20,000 acres of floodplain rearing habitat in the lower Sacramento River Basin.

2 The California EcoRestore Program implements a comprehensive suite of habitat

ro restoration actions to support the long-term health of the Delta and its native fish and wildlife

O 0 p species and identifies the Lower Yolo Ranch Restoration Project ("Project").

13. In 2007, Respondent Westlands purchased real property commonly known as Yolo
Ranch for the purpose of generating, restoring and enhancing habitat for smelt, salmon and
other Federal or State listed species.

7 14.

8 In 2013, the State and Federal Contractors Water Agency ("SFCWA") developed

9 plans for the Project to restore habitat for Delta Smelt and salmon by restoring estuarine marsh

10 and shallow water habitat on the Property and acting as the lead agency for the Project.

LI SFCWA prepared and certified a Final Environmental Impact Report pursuant to the California

12 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. for the Project. In

13 approving the Project, SFCWA approved Alternative No. 4, the Tidal Marsh Complex

14 alternative and adopted a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and findings related to
mitigation measures and alternatives.

15 15.

16 As approved, the Project invol ves modifying up to 1,790 acres of the

17 approximately 3,795-acre site. The overall site encompassed two contiguous properties: Yolo

18 Ranch and Yolo Flyway Farms located along the historic wetland-upland edge of the Yolo

19 Basin. The Yolo Flyway Farms parcels are not part of the current restoration Project design.

20 Restoration and enhancement measures involve the elimination or relocation of existing water

21 control infrastructure elements, grading some lands to facilitate establishment of intertidal

22 wetlands, excavating new starter tidal channels and swales to connect restored wetland areas to -...

23 adjacent tidal water bodies, removing irrigation from seasonal wetland features, and removing

24 or restricting grazing within the restored and enhanced areas. Tidal channels and swales will be

25 excavated to facilitate the movement of tidal water between existing tidal sources and restored
intertidal and seasonal wetlands.

26 [6.

27 Construction activities for the Project include: 1) tidal marsh restoration; 2)

28 seasonal marsh enhancement; 3) riparian enhancement; 4) irrigation and drainage
improvements; 5) soils reuse options; 6) buffer area creation; and 7) ditch work.

27 23. In or about 2017, Westlands took responsibility for development of the Project - .

28 In September 2018, Westlands prepared and approved an Addendum to the Lower
Yolo Restoration Project Final Environmental Impact Report (the "2018 Addendum"). (State

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE .-.

2 Clearinghouse # 2011032001.) The 2018 Addendum was prepared based upon design
modifications proposed by Westlands.
ou p w 24. On October 18, 2018, DWR and WWD entered into a "Conditional Delta Smelt
Habitat Acreage Credit Development and Purchase Agreement (the "Preliminary Agreement").
The Preliminary Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which DWR and

D Westlands will collaborate to develop, manage and construct the Project, to establish the
purchase price per Habitat Acreage Credits which DWR shall pay to

8 Westlands, and to transfer

9 the Restored Habitat and the Buffer Zone to DWR after completion of the Project.

25.

10 In June 2019, DWR and Westlands entered into the Agreement, which provides for

11 DWR to acquire the Project lands from Westlands on certain conditions, and effecti vely funds

17 shares of Sweetwater appurtenant to the portion of the Property to be con veyed to DWR

18 (Restored Habitat and Buffer Zone); 3) to assign a portion of Sweetwater's water licenses to

19 DWR; and 4) to extinguish DWR's shares in Sweetwater after partial assignment of the water
rights licenses.

20 27. Nothing in the 2013 Final EIR or the 2018 Addendum discussed modification of

21

22 Sweetwater's water rights nor did they analyze or discuss the impacts modification of the water
rights may

24 Respondent Westlands has at all times been aware that a modification to the water

25 rights of Sweetwater Company would constitute a material change in the Project, as Westlands

26 submitted comments to the draft EIR commenting on potential impacts to the water rights,

27 which prompted responses from SFCWA in the Final EIR indicating that the Project would not
affect Sweetwater Company's water rights.

AW N On July 3, 2019, the Department of General Services approved the Agreement
between DWR and Westlands.

n Despite repeated requests from Petitioner to Westlands and DWR, Westlands and

6 DWR refused to provide Petitioner a copy of the Agreement. Westlands and DWR refused to

7 provide the Agreement to Petitioner on the purported grounds that public disclosure of the

8 Agreement would disclose financial information in the Preliminary Agreement, Exhibit A,

9 Attachment I to Agreement. On November 21, 2019, Donald Mooney, counsel for Mound
Farms contacted DWR's legal office to request a copy

10 of the Agreement under the Public

LI Records Act, Government Code, section 5250 et seq. Petitioner's counsel asserted that there

12 was no legal basis under the Public Records Act for withholding public disclosure of an .-.--

13 Agreement between public agencies. Counsel for DWR then called Westlands' General

14 Manager to inform him of Mound Farm's request. On the morning of November 22, 2019,
Westlands finally provided a copy of the Agreement to Mound Farms. -

15

16 Prior to providing the Agreement on November 22, 2019, neither Westlands nor

17 DWR had disclosed to the public, including Petitioner, the Preliminary Agreement approved in

27 Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a +1A-

28 manner required by law by failing to provide supplementa! or subsequent environmental review .--

for the modifications to the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

OüAW N - 41. The modifications to the Project includes modification of the points of diversion of
the water rights for Sweetwater Company that are the water rights required for implementation -- al
of the Project. Such change to the points of diversion of water rights may impact Petitioner's
ability to receive water through Sweetwater Company and may have potentially significant
environmental impacts to Petitioner's property - Mound Farms.

42. CEQA requires that

7 an agency to prepare a subsequent environmental review
document when there are changes to a

8 project or its circumstances occurs after adoption of an

0 environmental impact report. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(c).)
Changes in a project require preparation of a subsequent or supplemental environmental

10 document when the following conditions are found to exist:
= N 8 the change in the project is substantial; the change involves new
impacts; OF more severe significant environmental

13 (3) the change will required major revisions to the previous
14 environmental document based on the new or more severe impacts;
and

15 (4) the new or more severe impacts were not considered in the previous

16 environmental document. (ld.)

43.

17 The Agreement between DWR and Westlands discloses for the first time that the

18 Project requires modification to amend the water rights licenses for the water that is required for

[9 construction and implementation of the Project. Neither the 2013 EIR nor the 2018 Addendum |

20 addressed or discussed any modifications to Sweetwater Company's water rights. Nor did they
discuss the potential impacts associated with the modifications to Sweetwater's water rights. -

21 -

44.

22 The changes to Sweetwater Company's water rights described in the Agreement ---r

23 harm Petitioner, as well as any future owners of land within the remaining geographic bounds of :

24 Sweetwater Company, because such changes reduce the quantity of water Sweetwater Company

25 is entitled to. A reduction of Sweetwater Company's overall water right, even if implemented

26 On an acre-proportionate basis, is harmful for at least two reasons. First, the entirety of

27 Sweetwater's water rights can be, and is, applied to different fields at different times, and in so!

28 doing concentrated in its application. Both Petitioner and Respondent Westlands have, at times,
concentrated the entirety of Sweetwater Company's water rights into single fieids or areas while
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

others were not being irrigated. This is permitted, as Sweetwater's water license only limits

2 Sweetwater's rate of diversion in total, and not the rate of application to any specific area within

W Sweetwater's geographic bounds. By dividing the water right and leaving Sweetwater

4 Company with a smaller overall entitlement, as the Agreement proposes, the remaining

5 shareholders of Sweetwater Company will be forced to collectively divert water at a slower rate,

6 which will affect the rate at which irrigation can occur. This will have direct impact on -..-i

7 Petitioner's operations and its existing restoration project, thus having a potentially significant

8 impacts to wildlife and the environment. Second, water is re-lifted (i.e., recycled/reused) within

9 Sweetwater Company's water conveyance system such that an equal allocation of water among

10 the acres occurs without necessarily a proportionate initial diversion to each acre. This is true

II because Sweetwater Company's conveyance system (and the general topography of the Yolo

12 Bypass) flows generally North to South, and a significant amount of water provided to southern

13 fields originates from a disproportionately hi gher initial application of water to northern fields.

14 Historically water has been diverted and initially applied to northern acres at a higher rate than

15 southern acres on account of this ability to reuse/recycle water to irrigate the southern acres.

16 Given that the Project area represents the southern-most acres within Sweetwater Company's

17 geographic bounds, and the lands of Petitioner are among the northern-most acres, a reduction

18 in the overall water rights of Sweetwater Company will have a disproportionate effect on

19 Petitioner and Petitioner's restoration projects (and the other lands of Sweetwater Company not ---

20 within the Project area).

21 45. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, Respondents' approval of the

22 Agreement violated the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondent

23 prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project. As such, the

24 Court should issue writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside the certification of the

25 EIR and approval of the Project.

26 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION

Dear Mr. Kim, Ms. Nemeth and Mr. Birmingham:
Please take notice that under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioner
Mound Farms intends to file Petition for Writ of Mandate in Yolo County Superior
Court under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act against the California Department of General Services, California Department of Water Resources,
and Westlands Water District. The Petition challenges the approval of Agreement
Number 460012954 between Department of Water Resources and Westlands Water District. The Agreement provides in part for the modification of water rights held by Sweetwater Company, a mutual water company, to support the construction of implementation of the Lower Yolo Ranch Restoration Project on lands owned by Westlands. The Sweetwater Company's water rights are also relied upon by Mound Farms for its property and restoration efforts. In approving the Agreement, Respondents did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, section 21000 and the CEQA
Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq. Although in
2013, the State & Federal Contractors Water Agency prepared and certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Lower Yolo Restoration Project and in 2018 Westlands approved an Addendum to the Final Environmental Impact Report for the
Lower Yolo Restoration Project, neither environmental document addressed or
