1 1. This action challenges the August 6, 2019 decision of the City of Palmdale City

2 Council ("City Council"), evaluating the recommendation by the City of Palmdale Planning

3 Commission (the Planning Commission, collectively with the City Council, "Respondents") to

4 approve the Palmdale General Plan Amendment 19-001 ("GPA"), the Zone Change 19-001, the

5 planned development 19-001, the tentative tract map 82636, the conditional use permit 19-002

6 ("CUP") and the site plan review 19-003 (collectively, the "Approvals"), for the project

7 commonly also known as the Palmdale Strata project, which proposes an approximately 43,000
square feet of retail/commercial development with 814 parking spaces scattered throughout the
8 site, as well as 308 apartment residences and 36 townhome residences all to be constructed on an
9 undeveloped parcel of land located at the northwest corner of Rancho Vista Boulevard and 15™*

10 Street West (collectively, the "Project").

11 2. The decision of the City Council presumes to allow changes to the land use and

12 zoning designations to accommodate the residential components of the Project. The City

13 Council's approval operates in stark contravention of the California Environmental Quality Act

14 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code $ 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California

15 Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Codel

16 § 65300 et seq. Respondents prepared and relied on an initial study and a mitigated negative
declaration that fall well below CEQA's minimum standards.
17 3. The mitigated negative declaration failed to analyze adequately the significant
18 impacts to a range of environmental resources including urban decay, transportation and traffic,
19 air quality, and public services. For example, the intended grocery store and multiple restaurants,
20 including a fast food restaurant with drive through service, could not only result in closures of

21 existing businesses in the area, leading to urban blight, but also adds to the traffic and noise in

22 the region, creating a terrible nuisance for the surrounding residential neighborhoods. This

23 resultant influx of commercial traffic will sharply clash with the intended dense apartment

24 construction and will especially clash with the ingress/egress traffic from the townhomes, which

25 will need to use the planned grocery store's parking lot to access the main thoroughfare. This is
logistical nightmare not only for existing residents, but also for the intended new residents and
26 businesses.

1 4. As it is currently planned, the Project as proposed creates an environment that: (i)

2 will drastically reduce the quality of life for existing residents; (ii) contravenes certain lifestyle

3 promises that were made by the City to potential homebuyers and that ultimately prompted many

4 of Responsible Growth Palmdale's resident members to purchase their homes in the first place,

5 and (iii) unnecessarily creates structural and risky challenges for new residents and businesses.

6 The mitigated negative declaration dismissed the Project's impacts on urban blight, traffic, noise

7 and nuisance issues in a cursory fashion based upon flawed and outdated information that was
not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside the
8 Approvals because Respondents have manifestly failed to comply with CEQA and applicable
9 state, and local, planning and zoning laws.
10
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11

12 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to CCP §§ 187, 526, 1085,

13 and 1094.5, and PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of a

14 mandate directing the City Council to vacate and set aside its Project Approvals under the CCP

15 §§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court
because Respondents and the Project are all located in Los Angeles County. 16 6. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of residents who rent and own property 17 in and around Palmdale, who are adversely affected by the Project Approvals, and who are
18 beneficially interested in the quality of life in Palmdale through responsible construction project
19 planning and development.

20 7. Petitioner is beneficially and directly interested the actions of the City Council

21 and the Planning Commission, in approving the Project, which would directly, adversely and

22 irreparably affect Petitioner, the environment, and the larger community of the City of Palmdale,

23 as described herein.

THE PARTIES 24
8. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of individuals, including, but not 25 limited to, Petitioner, including Kristin Bennett, who will be adversely affected by the traffic, air
26 quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other impacts generated by the Project.
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT); GOVERNMENT CODE § 65300 ET SEQ. (STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

8

1 Petitioner includes individuals and their families, who live and work in the City of Palmdale.

2 Because they are local residents, the individual members of Petitioner would be directly affected

3 by the traffic, air quality. soil quality, ground water quality, noise, and other environmental

4 impacts created by the Project. In addition, individual members may also work on the Project

5 itself. As such, they would be first in line to be exposed to any health and safety hazards that

6 exist on the Project site.
9. Respondents, the Planning Commission and City Council, are each a local
7 government agency and a political subdivision of the State of California, charged with the
8 authority to regulate and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times
9 to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA
10 and the CEQA Guidelines. The Planning Commission is the Lead Agency under CEQA for the
11 preparation of required environmental analysis pertaining to the Project. The City Council is the
12 legislative body for the City of Palmdale, and, thus, has the authority to legislate and use and
13 policy, including changes thereto, within its jurisdiction. As the legislative body for the City of

14 Palmdale, the City Council is ultimately responsible for the approval of the Project.
10.
15 Real party in interest, Coyne Development (*Applicant," or "Developer"), is the

16 applicant for the entitlements that constitute the Project. Based on the Applicant's status as the
sole identified applicant and developer of the Project, and on Petitioner's information and belief,
17 Applicant adequately represents the interests of any and all other non-joined parties in the
18 Project.

19 11. As a result of the objections posed by its constituent members, and others,

20 Petitioner has exhausted, or is excused from exhausting, all of its administrative remedies, and

21 now seeks the assistance of the Court to resolve the issues set forth herein pursuant to PRC §§

22 21177(a).

23 12. Moreover, as a result of the actions of Respondents as hereinbefore alleged,

24 Petitioner has been compelled to engage attorneys to challenge the ultra vires actions of
Respondents and to advance costs in connection therewith. Petitioner will accordingly seek the 25 recovery of attorneys' fees and costs upon the successful conclusion of this case.

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2
Proiect Background: Environmental Review and Approval
3
13.
4 The initial study was prepared for the Planning Commission as of July 2019 to
evaluate if the Project would have significant impact on the environment. Although the initial
5 study purported to analyze impacts related to air quality, biological and archeological resources,
6 geological issues, drainage, sewer, acoustics and traffic, the initial study fails in a number of
7 respects to properly analyze the impacts on the environment caused by the Project.

8 14. For example, the initial study fails to assess the significance of Project-level
9 greenhouse gas impacts under CEQA, nor does it adequately address how specific strategies

10 might be implemented at the Project level. Compliance with CAT Report emission reduction

11 strategies was not among the methods for determining significance under CEQA identified by

12 the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association ("CAPCOA"), or the California Office

13 of Planning and Research ("CA OPR"). The initial study's reliance on Antelope Valley Air
Quality Management District's Significant Emissions Thresholds to determine that Project's 14 greenhouse gas emissions were less than significant was arbitrary and not supported by
15 substantial evidence. Petitioner submitted comments on the initial study which pointed to the
16 initial study's inadequate analysis of the Project's air quality impacts and the failure to adopt
17 feasible mitigation measures to reduce Project impacts.

18 15. On July 11, 2019 the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider the
19 Developer's application to develop the Project. The Planning Commission approved the Project

20 at the conclusion of the hearing.
16.
21 On August 6, 2019 the City Council held a public hearing to consider the Project

22 and the Project was approved by a 3 to 1 vote. When a project is approved by local agencics, like
the City Council, that approval triggers the mandatory filing of a Notice of Determination of the
23 approval for projects "for which...[a] negative declaration was prepared." PRC §§ 21167, subds.
24 (b) and (c), 21152, subds. (a), (c); CEQA Guidelines, § 15112, subd. (c)(1). The Project was the
25 subject of a negative declaration. Thus, upon issuing the Approvals, the City Council had a duty
26 to file a Notice of Determination of that action.

1 17.

2 PRC § 21152, subd. (a) and CEQA Guidelines § 15075 subd. (d), 15094 subd. (a),

3 (d) state that "[l]ocal agencies must [emphasis added] file their Notice of Determination within

4 five working days after approving projects." The Notice of Determination was required to be

5 filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk no later than August 13, 2019. Local agencies must file
their Notice of Determination "with the county clerk of each county in which the project will be

6 located." PRC, § 21152, subd. (a); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15062, subd. (c)(2), 15075, subd. (d),

7 15094, subd. (d). Despite this requirement, as of the date of this filing, no Notice of

8 Determination regarding the Approvals has been filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk.
18.
9 As the Respondent City Council failed to file the mandatory Notice of

10 Determination for its approval of the Project, the statute of limitations in this matter is extended

11 to one hundred and eighty (180) days beyond the date of the Approvals by the City Council, or

12 February 2, 2020. PRC §§ 21167, subd.(d), 21152, subds. (a), (c); CEQA Guidelines, §15112,
subd. (c)(5)(A).

14 Petitioner has complied with PRC § 21167.5 by prior service of a notice upon the
Respondents indicating Petitioner's Notice of Intent to File a Verified Petition for Writ of

15 Mandate. Proof of Service of this notification, with the notification, is attached hereto as Exhibit

16 A, and is made a part hereof.
20.
17 Petitioner has requested that the Planning Commission and City Council each

18 prepare their respective portion of the record of proceedings in the within proceeding and that

19 such Respondents employ alternative methods of record preparation as appropriate in order to
save costs. The Notice of Request for the Administrative Record was served pursuant to PRC §
20 21167.6(b)(1). A true and correct copy of this notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B, and is

EIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA:
Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration Do Not Comply With CEQA)

21.
5 Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
above.
6
22. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an a environmental document 7 that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public
8 review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. A mitigated
9 negative declaration, which replaces a full environmental impact report, must provide sufficient
10 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental

11 consequences when acting on proposed projects. Petitioner alleges that Respondents rushed

12 through the approval process for the Project, including the preparation of a mitigated negative

13 declaration, which was approved by the City Council, without providing a public review process

14 for all adjacent residents who were interested in the Project.
23.
15 Respondents violated CEQA by certifying a mitigated negative declaration for the
Project that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondents: 16

17 a. Failed adequately to disclose or analyze the Project's significant impacts

18 on the environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's impacts on traffic, air quality,

19 aesthetics and public services and utilities;

20 b. Failed to adopt a consistent and appropriate environmental "baseline" for
21 analysis of the Project's environmental impacts.

22 C. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures;

23 d. Failed adequately to mitigate the Project's impacts;
24.
24 As result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
discretion by certifying mitigated negative declaration that does not comply with CEQA and by 25 approving the Project in reliance thercon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the
26 mitigated negative declaration and approval of the Project must be set aside. The process must be

12

reopened for certain adjacent residents, who didn't receive notice of the proceedings at all. Manyl

2 of these residents are appalled to find the nature and scope of the Project contravene the local

3 government's promises to them that they were purchasing in a community that would never

4 suffer from urban sprawl. The density proposed by the Project belies this promise and seriously

5 impacts the quality of life for these residents. The mitigated negative declaration must consider
these issues in a fulsome environmental review.
6
25.
7 Notedly, the proposed changes in the initial study/mitigated negative declaration
are not being made to the design, or the density, of the proposed Project itself. Rather, the
8 changes are sweeping zoning changes, and a general plan amendment change, that will greatly
9 impact the entire area surrounding the Project. Specifically, the zoning for the area of the Project
10 encompassing the townhomes is proposed to be changed from C3 (commercial) to R-3 (multi-
11 family residential) and the area encompassing the apartments is proposed to change from C3

12 (commercial) to R-4 (medium to high density residential). As this is a significant change that

13 amounts to spot zoning, that sets a precedence for development in a neighborhood that was

14 previously residential, and that may involve significant impacts to traffic patterns, noise, and

15 public and worker health and safety, both during, and after, construction, the public must have

16 time to consult with experts in order to determine how these changes might negatively impact the
community and whether a more encompassing environmental review should be conducted to
17 consider these issues.
18 26. At its July 11, 2019, mecting, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution No.
19 PC-2019-027 recommending that the Palmdale City Council approve a general plan amendment
20 (GPA 19-001) and a zoning change (ZC 19-001) for the benefit of the Project. The Planning

21 Commission found these changes to the Palmdale General Plan and the Palmdale's zoning

22 ordinances to collectively function as a mitigated negative declaration and determined that the

23 Project should be sent to the Palmdale City Council for approval. Then, a mere 26 days later, on

24 August 6, 2019, the City Council rubber stamped the initial study/mitigated negative declaration,

25 and approved the proposed Project, without giving the public a sufficient opportunity to view the
initial study/mitigated negative declaration, with the assistance of experts, or to consider how the
26 proposed general plan amendment and zoning changes might affect the community, and whether
27

13

a full environmental review should be conducted to fully study these issues. At a minimum, the

2 public must have time to review the plan (and time to secure competent professional assistance

3 to help with the review) as the general plan is changed by the initial study/mitigated negative

4 declaration (including the general plan amendment and zoning changes).

5 27. The initial study/mitigated negative declaration did not fully consider the impact

6 of the requested amendment to the general plan and the zoning change, inasmuch as they will, in

7 turn, impact water usage and quality, traffic, noise, health and safety, and other issues in the area.
both during construction, and after this dense Project is built. These water, traffic, noise, health,
8 safety and other impacts are significant, deleterious, and unavoidable. The failure to consider
9 these issues renders the initial study/mitigated negative declaration ineffective. As a result of its
10 shortcomings the initial study/mitigated negative declaration lacks substantial evidence to

11 support its conclusions and fails to properly mitigate the Project's significant environmental

12 impacts.

13 28. Based upon Petitioner's review of the City of Palmdale Report to the Mayor and

14 Members of the City Council from the City Manager, dated as of August 6, 2019, we conclude

15 that the initial study/mitigated negative declaration fails to comply with CEQA requirements. We
recommend that the City Council set aside the Approvals and conduct a full environmental 16 review of the Project.
17 29. CEQA has two basic purposes, neither of which the initial study/mitigated
18 negative declaration satisfies. Firstly, CEQA is designed to inform decisionmakers, and the
19 public about the potential significant environmental effects of a project. CEQA Guidelines
20 §15002(a)(1). CEQA requires that an agency analyze potentially significant environmental

21 impacts in an EIR. PRC $21000; CEQA Guidelines §15002. Specifically, an EIR should result

22 from "extensive research and information gathering," including consultation with state and

23 federal agencies, local officials, and the interested public. (emphasis added.) Berkeley Keep Jets

24 Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of Port Comm. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4t h 1344, 1367 (Berkeley
Jets); Schaeffer Land Trust v. San Jose City Council (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 612, 620. 25 30. To be adequate, the EIR should evidence the lead agency's good faith effort at
26 full disclosure. CEQA Guidelines §15151; see also Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT); GOVERNMENT CODE § 65300 ET SEQ. (STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

14

1 Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 406 (Laurel Heights I). The
2  environmental review has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is

3 to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have

4 reached ecological points of no return." County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.

5 Thus, the environmental review protects not only the environment but also informed self-

6 government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.
31.
7 Secondly, CEQA directs public agencies to avoid, or reduce, environmental
damage when possible by requiring alternatives, or mitigation measures. CEQA Guidelines
8 §15002(a)(2)-(3); Berkeley Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App. 4th at 1354. The environmental review
9 serves to provide public agencies and the public in general with information about the effect that
10 a proposed project is likely to have on the environment and to "identify ways that environmental

11 damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." CEQA Guidelines §15002(a)(2). If a project

12 a has a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve the project only upon a

13 finding that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment

14 where feasible," and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are "acceptable

15 due to overriding concerns" specified in CEQA §21081. CEQA Guidelines §15092(b)(2)(A)-(B).
32. For the reasons stated herein, the Project Approvals must be set aside and full 16 environmental review must be conducted to address the errors and deficiencies that exist in the
17 areas of traffic, health, safety and the general quality of life in Palmdale.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (VIOLATION OF CEQA;

21 Respondents Failed to Properly or Adequately Notify Adjacent Residents

22 of the Public Comment Process)

23 33. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
24 above.

25 34. In situations where the City of Palmdale is contemplating large construction
26 projects, Palmdale Municipal Code 17.20.020g (ii) provides notice requirements for area

27 residents. The statute provides, in pertinent part, "If the subject property is greater than 20 acres

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT); GOVERNMENT CODE § 65300 ET SEQ. (STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

15

•

but less than 160 acres in size, all properties within a 700-foot radius shall be notified." The

2 Project is 20.55 acres.

3 35. An unincorporated area of the County of Los Angeles ("County") borders the

4 Project site. The City of Palmdale failed to provide proper notice of the proceedings and the

5 Project to these residents in the unincorporated areas of the County. Many of these residents had

6 no idea the Project was under consideration. The lack of notice was improper.
36.
7 PRC § 21092, subd. (b)(3); CEQA Guidelines, § 15072, subd. (a) requires that the §
lead agency (in this case the City Council) "provide notice of its intent to adopt a negative
8 declaration to the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the county clerk of each
9 county within which the proposed project is located, sufficiently prior to adoption by the lead
10 agency of the negative declaration…to allow the public and agencies the review period" required

11 by the statute and guidelines. a mitigated negative declaration on the Project. These residents in

12 the unincorporated area of the County are located directly adjacent to the Project and should

13 have received notice of the proceedings. They did not. The County residents never received

14 direct notice of the proceedings, and on information and belief, Petitioner believes that the

15 Respondents failed to provide any such notice required by CEQA Guidelines, § 15072, subd. (a)

16 to the residents of the County. For this reason, the Project Approvals must be set aside and a full
environmental review of the Project must be conducted in full compliance with CEQA
17 requirements.
18 37. In addition to noticing individuals and organizations as set forth above, PRC §
19 21092, subd. (b)(3); CEQA Guidelines, § 15072, subd.(b) each provide that the lead agency must
20 also provide notice through at least one of the following methods:

21
a. Publication at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
22 affected by the proposed project;
23
b.
24 Posting of notice on-and off-site in the area where the project will be located; or

25 C. Direct mailing to owners and occupants of contiguous property as shown on the

26 latest equalized assessment roll.

16

1 38. The latest equalized assessment roll will show these County residents to exist. On
2 information and belief, Plaintiff believes that Defendant failed to post a notice of the public

3 hearing process in the manner provided in paragraph 36, above. For these reasons, the Project

4 Approvals must be set aside and a full environmental review must be conducted on the Project.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings in the Mitigated Negative Declaration)
8

9 39. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

10 above.

40.
11 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead 12 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
13 reached.

14 41. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter
15 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not

16 limited to, the following:

17 a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant

18 and/or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on

19 the environment;

b.
20 The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation
measures that would have avoided, or lessened, the significant impacts of the Project were 21 infeasible; and
22 C. The determination that overriding economic, legal, social, technological,
23 or other benefits of the Project outweighed its significant impacts on the environment.

24 42. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

25 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and by

26 approving the Project in reliance thercon. Accordingly, the City Council's certification of the

P I recommendations of the Planning Commission, and the City Council's subsequent approval of

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: The Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration Fails
to Implement All Feasible Operational Mitigation Measures) 6

7 43. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

8 above.

44. Under CEQA, the City of Palmdale cannot approve the Project as proposed

10 because there are feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen one of
the Project's significant environmental effects. PRC, § 21002. For example, Petitioner asserts 11 that the Developer has provided no plan to put in a crosswalk from the Project to the mall across
12 the street. This presents a significant public safety issue. Additionally, there are no mitigation
13 measures at all planned to alleviate the loss of service level at the intersections due to the
14 increased traffic density. Furthermore, the Developer failed to consider alternative sites that
15 might be better suited for the development. There are any number of alternative sites that might

16 have been chosen, none of which would pose the detrimental impacts to the surrounding

17 residential communities as are posed by the current chosen site. Finally, the Project currently

18 contemplates only one (1) major source of entry and exit from the proposed Project. As a result,

19 pedestrian automobile conflicts can be expected to increase. This will necessarily cause traffic
issues in the area, possibly creating back-ups onto side streets and increasing the potential for 20 traffic accidents.
21 45. The City of Palmdale must consider mitigation measures to alleviate these
22 dangers and concerns and propose feasible mitigation measures that will be made available in a
23 full environmental review that may be ordered by this Court. See CEQA Guidelines
24 §15088.5(a)(3); South County Citizens for Smart Growth v. County of Nevada (2013) 221

25 Cal.App.4th 316, 330 (holding that recirculation is required when a new mitigation measure is

26 feasible, is considerably different from the mitigation measures already evaluated in a draft

27 mitigated negative declaration, would clearly lessen the project's significant environmental

18

F impacts, and is not adopted).

2 The Planned Apartments are Smaller Than is Required by Palmdale Municipal Code

3 46. Palmdale Municipal Code § 17.44.090 provides minimum size requirements for

4 apartments to be constructed. Studio apartments must have a minimum of 500 sq. ft. of livable

5 area. The Project plans for the studio apartments to have only 462 sq. ft. of living space, a

6 significant reduction in the regulatorily mandated size. A 1-bedroom apartment is required to
have a minimum of 600 sq. ft. of livable area. The administrative record doesn't state the size of
7 the 1-bedroom apartments, but it does mention that a 2-bedroom apartment will have a maximum
8 of 1,008 sq. ft. The Palmdale Municipal Code requires a 2-bedroom apartment to have
9 minimum of 800 square feet.
10 Significant Traffic Challenges Arise From the Project

11 47. Several issues arise from the Project with respect to parking, traffic flows, speed
12 limits surrounding the Project, traffic congestion and public safety.

13 48. With respect to the parking situation, the Project stands to create logistical

14 nightmares for nearby residents. Parking regulations for residential units, and for commercial

15 spaces, in Palmdale are set forth in Title 17 of the Palmdale Municipal Code
49. Palmdale Municipal Code § 17.87.030 requires commercial spaces to have one 16 (1) space for every 100 square feet of gross floor space. The Project is intended to cover 43,200
17 square feet, which would require 432 spaces. The Developer's plan provides 193 fewer parking
18 spaces for the commercial development than is required by the statute. Townhomes must have
19 two and one-quarter (2.25) spaces each, one (1) of which must be covered. The Project
20 contemplates 36 townhomes, but only provides 81 spaces, which is 24 fewer spaces than is

21 required by the statute. Palmdale Municipal Code Section 17.87.030 also requires apartments to

22 have two and one quarter (2.25) spaces per unit. The Project plans just 693 spaces for all of the

23 apartments, which is 174 fewer spaces than are required by statute. These are not insignificant

24 numbers. If the Developer is not providing enough parking for residents of the constructed
development hundreds of people will be parking on the surrounding streets. This can create a 25 number of issues that greatly impact traffic, safety and the quality of life for Palmdale residents.
26

27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR § WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT); GOVERNMENT CODE § 65300 ET SEQ. (STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

19

1 50. The Developer has allotted a total of 814 parking spaces, which are scattered
2 throughout the site, for the Project, including 308 apartment residences and 36 townhome

3 residences. Importantly, the Project, which will include studios, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom

4 apartments, provides markedly fewer parking spaces for residents than Palmdale Municipal Code

5 Section 17.87.030 requires.
51.
6 The reduction in parking spaces can be overlooked if rapid transit exists in the

7 area. It appears from the Project plans that only one (1) bus stop will be placed near the Project.
One (1) bus stop does not constitute rapid transit. It's just one (1) bus stop. The Developer may
8 be able to meet this requirement by creating bicycle parking, or by providing a shuttle to rapid
9 transit in the area. The Developer does not anticipate providing any such bicycle parking or
10 shuttle service. For this reason, the Project will create an unacceptable amount of traffic

11 congestion in the area. This is antithetical to the lifestyle that was originally promised to
12 Palmdale residents by their local government.

13 52. Importantly, the Planning Manager can override Palmdale Municipal Code's Title

14 17 parking ordinances. It appears that this has occurred. However, the Planning Manager doesn't

15 have unfettered discretion to make such a determination on a whim. No rationale, or explanation,

16 has been provided to area residents to explain why the Project is not required to comply with the
existing regulatory landscape.
17 53. Certain traffic-related logistical challenges also arise because of the Project.
18 Firstly, drivers exiting the planned townhomes will have to go through the grocery store parking
19 lot to get out of the neighborhood. This will create a situation where people with a mindset to
20 drive quickly and be on their way will cross paths with people with a mindset of parking their

21 cars. This creates a ripe environment for traffic accidents.

22 54. Furthermore, it is unclear by the plans submitted by the Developer whether the

23 Developer plans to erect left turn lanes on Rancho Vista Boulevard. If left turn lanes are not

24 mandated for the Project along this street, additional traffic hazards will be created. For example,

25 residents on Dover Drive are currently seen struggling to get across Rancho Vista Boulevard,
and they can't sce cross traffic on Rancho Vista Boulevard, which has a 55 mph. There was a
26 motorcycle and car collision last year on Dunbar Street, which resulted in the death of the
27

• 20

1 motorcycle driver, who was on Dover Drive attempting to turn left onto Rancho Vista Drive. If

2 these problems exist now, they stand to be greatly exacerbated by the Project as it is currently

3 planned. The picture, below, illustrates the dangers inherent at this location:

13

14 55. It is Petitioner's understanding that the City of Palmdale will soon extend Rancho

15 Vista Boulevard to 6 lanes across from 20th Street up to 30th street. This planned expansion
doesn't come all the way down to Dover Drive, where the fatal accident occurred, or to the 16

17 project. However, due to the anticipated increase in traffic volume, and for public safety
reasons, raised medians will be constructed from 27th Street West to Dunbar Street, which will
18 restrict left turns at the following intersections, which will directly impact the Project:
19 a. No left turn from northbound Dunbar onto westbound Rancho Vista
20 Boulevard;

21 b. No Left turn from westbound Rancho Vista Boulevard onto Riverbend

22 Street; and

C. No Left turn from northbound Riverbend Street onto eastbound Rancho 23

24 Vista Boulevard.

56. Petitioner notes that the Developer has no plans to install a crosswalk from 15th 25
Street across to the mall. Pedestrian traffic will be either greatly inconvenienced, or endangered, 26 by this plan. Given all of these significant impacts on traffic flow, patterns and congestion in the 27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); § PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT); GOVERNMENT CODE § 65300 ET SEQ. (STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

21

area that would be created by the Project, the Project Approvals must be set aside, and a proper

2 environmental review needs to be conducted on the Project.
57. As demonstrated above, the initial study/mitigated negative declaration fails to

4 adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts, resulting in a

5 legally deficient CEQA document. The City of Palmdale must conduct a proper environmental

6 review that addresses these inadequacies and considers these critical issues.

7
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
8 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Response to Comments)
9 58. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
10 above.

11 59. Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by the
12 Petitioner, and by other members of the public. Instead, the responses given to numerous

13 comments regarding the Project's impacts to, air quality, traffic, as well as cumulative and
14 growth inducing impacts, impacts to the local lifestyle, public services, transportation and traffic,

15 population and housing, and regarding the adequacy of the initial study's/mitigated negative

16 declaration's treatment of mitigation measures and alternatives are conclusory, evasive,

17 confusing, or otherwise non-responsive and contrary to the requirements of CEQA.
60. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed
18 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,
19 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by
20 substantial evidence.

21 PRAYER FOR RELIEE

22 WHEREFORE, the Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

23 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate, commanding Respondents:
24 (A) to vacate and set aside the Project Approvals;
25
(B) undertake a reasonable and appropriate environmental review for the
26 Project;
