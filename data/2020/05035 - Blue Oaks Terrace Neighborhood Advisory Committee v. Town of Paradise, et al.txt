January 1, 2019) states:
i. (a) A local emergency may be proclaimed only by the governing body of a

23 On November 8, 2018, the director of emergency services of the Town proclaimed

Order B-57-18 on November 14, 2018. On November 12, 2018, the President of the United States

Resolution No. 18-42 to ratify the director of emergency services proclamation.

that the local emergency is continuing at least once every 60 days (at least once every 30 days
before January 1, 2019).

9. Following the adoption of Resolution No. 18-42, the Town Council determined on
January 23, 2019, that an Emergency related to the Camp Fire was still in effect. Since January 23,
2019, the Town Council has not reviewed that the local emergency is continuing every 30 days
until December 31, 2018, and every 60 days thereafter, as required by California law.
10. Following the adoption of Urgency Ordinance 590, the Town Council has not
conducted any review regarding whether the local emergency (Camp Fire) is continuing. Since

maintaining or demolishing burned homes or other facilities, rather it is simply storing and

8 processing trees that were burnt as a result of the Camp Fire on land which has been undeveloped

that did not exist prior to the Camp Fire, and it thus cannot be maintained, repaired, restored, or
replaced.

19 Section 21080(b)(4) exempts actions from CEQA review that are necessary to

20 prevent or mitigate an emergency. The Project does not meet the definition of "emergency" as
defined in California Public Resources Code Section 21060.3 as an occurrence. The definition of

21

22 "emergency" under CEQA limits an emergency to an occurrence that must involve a clear and

23 imminent danger, demanding immediate action. (CalBeach Advocates v. City of Solana Beach

24 (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 529, 536.) Moving burnt logs and storing them to process them into wood

25 chips is not an emergency occurrence, but rather a condition and a process to manage the condition
brought about as a result of an emergency occurrence, the Camp Fire. The trees were burned over
18 months

26
27 ago, So the existence of the trees is not a clear and imminent danger that requires
immediate action for which there is no time to comply with CEQA.

requirements of CEQA. The Project involves the establishment and operation of a Temporary Log
Storage & Processing Yard for the purpose of generating profit by processing burnt logs to wood
chips. Section 15269 was intended for projects that are required to replace/ restore/ repair/ maintain
properly or facilities that existed prior to the emergency occurrence. The Project is a new land use
activity that did not exist prior to the Camp Fire. The Project does not have the public interest
component required for the Emergency Exemption to CEQA. The Project does not protect the
health, safety, and welfare of those within the surrounding area of the Project Site or serve any
benefit to the surrounding residents or public in the Town of Paradise. The Project does not meet

10 the test nor qualify as an emergency project to protect public health and safety.

8 of temporary log storage yards to a maximum of five yards within the incorporated area of the
Town of Paradise.

The Town has not evaluated the health risks associated with the Project. The
residents of the Blue Oaks Terrace Neighborhood will experience immediate exposure to burnt
timber and ash char that accompany the fire-damaged wood. The inhalation and exposure to char

19 Use Permit approval was in violation of Urgency Ordinance 590.

20 Urgency Ordinance 590 requires a Temporary Log Storage Yard to obtain a Solid

21 Waste Facility Permit if operations qualify. (Town Municipal Code Sec. 8.59.080(C)(10).) The

22l Project proposes to operate seven days a week and receive 285 logging trucks per day weighing

23l up to 69,000 pounds per truck load. Based on the maximum trucks per day, the proposed Project

24| would move 9,832 tons per day, which volume qualifies the operation as a "full permit" type Solid

25 Waste Permit Facility under CalRecycle's regulatory authority. Real Party in Interest is required

26 to work with Butte County Environmental Health to determine if there is a requirement to register

27 a for a permit status. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Town and Real Party in Interest

28 have failed to comply with CalRecycle's Solid Waste Facility requirements. At the May 12th Public
Hearing the Town's Manager testified that the California Governor's Office of Emergency
Services estimated that the Town had approximately 150,000 tons of burnt trees on private

NntrO property which will require removal. Based on this estimated tonnage and planned logging truck
movements to the proposed site it appears that the proposed project is considered a "Full Permit"
