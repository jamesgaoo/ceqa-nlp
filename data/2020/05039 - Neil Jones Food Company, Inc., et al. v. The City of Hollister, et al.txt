.26 Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, 21168.5 and Government Code section 65000 et

27 seq., and allege additional causes of action directed to Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the City Council for the City of Hollister's ("City") decision,

3 without public input and comment, to engage in an action that significantly furthers the "Apricot

4 Lane Storm Water Diversion and Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant Improvements Project"

5 ("Project") in a manner that forecloses the mandatory environmental review that analyzes the
6 potential environmental impacts as well as alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily

7 be part of the environmental analysis that is required by tho California Environmental Quality Act

8 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq. The Projeot will bifurcato the City's Industrial

9 Wastewater Treatment Plant ("IWTP") from a treatment system that treats industrial wastewater

10 and storm water in each of its six ponding basins, into two separate treatment systems for

11 wastewater and storm water. The Project will do so by modifying Ponds 1, 3 and 4 so that they can

12 be used solely to treat wastewater, and modifying Ponds 2, 5 and 6 so that they can be used to treat

13 storm water and any wastewater overflows. The Project will also modify the City's storm drain

14 system to remove an outlet from it to the San Benito River and instead have the system deliver

15 storn water to the IWTP. While the ultimate aim of the Project is to treat storm water instead of

16 discharging it to the river, the City's own environmental consultant admits that there could be

17 significant effects to the environment, including the San Benito River, associated with the Project.

18 CEQA exists to fully analyze such impacts of a Project before approving a project and prohibits

19 taking steps towards its implementation that preclude the required analysis.

20 2. Specifically, Respondents have violated CEQA by requiring that Petitioner, as a

21 condition for its Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit ("Permit") for the year 2020, pay the City

22 seyeral million dollars to cover the cost of removing accumulated organic material (commonly

23 referred to as sludge) from the IWTP's Pond 2, because the City is changing its use from an

24 industrial wastewater treatment pond into a storm water treatment pond, and to pay for a study

25 related to the Project. This change, in furtherance of the Project, forecloses the analysis of potential

26 alternatives and mitigation measures, such as the no Project alternative. The City has also engaged

27 in other acts in regards to the Project, which although they do not impact potential alternative and
28 mitigation measures, when considered with the Permit, they constitute circumstances that indicate

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

the City has approved the Project without CEQA review, Moreover, during a recent discussion

2 concerning the Permit and the Project with Petitioner's Plant Manager, a City representative has
informed Petitioner that the City is now irrevocably committed to the Permit requirements for
4 • construction of the Project.

5 3. In addition to violating CEQA, the City's conduct in regards to effectively approving

6 the Project without first engaging in statutorily required openness and transparency violates the

7 Ralph M. Brown Act and constitutes an abuse of discretion. The City's extortion of fees for the

8 Project that are not reasonably related to nor have an essential nexus with Petitioner and its Permit
9 violate the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine (taking) and the Mitigation Fees Act. The fee
10 extortion is also a breach of an agreement between the City and Petitioner that Petitioner pay

11 $25,000.00 annual fee for sludge removal as a condition for the Permit.

12 4. Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez seek to enjoin the Respondents from their wrongful
13 conduct because it may negatively impact the environment. Petitioner is part of state and federal

14 critical infrastructure as an essential link in the food chain. Forcing Petitioner to discontinue its

15 business as. Respondents may do through their wrongful acts, will result in irreparable harm to

16 Petitioner, to workers that are directly or indirectly related to Petitioner, and to food growers who
17 l will not be able to distribute their crops, all adding to the already existing economic and food supply

18 crisis.

19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
21 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 187, and 526 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and
22 Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5. This Court has the authority to issue

23 a writ of mandate directing the City to vacate and set aside its improper approval of conduct in
24 furtherance of the Project, and its improper and unlawful fee requirements under the Code of Civil

25 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, 5th Amendment Article 1, Section 7 of Cal. Const.

26 6. Venue for this action properly lies in the San Benito County Superior Court because
27 Respondents and the Project are located in San Benito County,

28 ///

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 THE PARTIES

2 7. Petitioner is a duly licensed Washington corporation admitted to do business in

3 California, and a taxpayer in the City. Many of its employees are residents of the City and/or the

4 County of San Benito.

5 8. Ana Jimenez is a resident of the City and the County of San Benito. As a resident
6 of the City, she receives her water from the City's utility service, and would be impacted by changes

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

STANDING *•
1

2 14. Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez bring this action as citizens and taxpayers in the State of

3 California. Petitioner and its employees, including Ms. Jimenez, live, engage in recreational

4 activities, and/or travel in the vicinity of the proposed Project. Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez would

5 suffer adverse impacts from the Respondents' actions in approving this Project. Such adverse

6 impacts would include impacts on the air quality in the air basin, impacts on ground water

7 resources, and indirect impacts based on blight, among others.

8 •15, The Project may adversely impact the air quality, water quality, water quantity, and
9 the public health and safety of Petitioner together with its employees who live in the area who will
10 be impacted by the Project and who would otherwise have individual standing to bring this action.
11 By failing to engage in a review of the environmental impact of the Project under CEQA, the City
12 has placed Petitioner and its employees, inoluding Ms. Jimenez, at risk for their health and to their
13 property, including the property of Petitioner. Therefore Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez have standing

14 to assert the claims raised in this Petition. In addition, this matter raises issues of publio rights and
15 the enforcement of public duties. The public interest will suffer if the City does not properly
16 perform its duties, The protection of this public interest is germane to Petitioner's interests as stated

17 herein.

18 STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 A. Petitioner:

20 16. Petitioner is a food processor engaged in tomato processing. It has owned and

21 operated the facility in Hollister since 1977. However, the facility has been in existence since 1937.
22 Recent economic studies concerning it estimate its annual impact to the City, county, state, and
23 national economies to be in excess of $235,000,000.00.

24 17. Petitioner receives conventional and organically farmed tomatoes from growers in
25 the region and processes them into crushed, ground, chopped, peeled, or diced tomatoes, and purees,
26 pastes, sauces, and catsup. Its oporation is CCOF and USDA Certified Organic, certified Kosher
27 and Halal, and Safe Quality Foods Certified Level 2 (a food safety certification system). Although

28 Petitioner sells its products to consumers for profit, it also participates as vendor for the United

5- PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

2 ("SNAP") and Feeding America by providing foodstuffs at discounted prices. Both programs will

3 play a vital role as our county, state, and nation revive from COVID-19 and the worst economic

4 downturn the world has experienced since the Great Depression. Petitioner has been awarded

5 USDA, SNAP and Feeding Amorica Contracts for the 2020 tomato-processing season.

6 18. Petitioner is, and has been, part of the nation's critical infrastructure as designated

7 by the federal government's Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure

8 Security Agency because of its involvement in food production, On March 20, 2020, in response

9 to the COVID-19 outbreak, Governor Newsom issued a stay-at-home order which sought to balance

10 to protect Californians from infection and the need to maintain Californians' access to vital supplies

11 and services. The Governor's order established that businesses designated as "critical
12 infrastructure" by the fedoral government would be considered "essential" to California and be

13 allowed to operate despite the order. Specifically, Governor Newsom stated "CT order that
14 Californians working in these 16 critical infrastructure sectors may continue their work because of
15 the importance of these sectors to Californians' health and well-being..." and further provided in

16 his order that "the supply chain must continue, and Californians must have acoess to such

17 necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care," (Emphasis added.)

18 B. THE IWTP

19 19. The City owns and operates the IWTP, which treats and handles industrial
20 (commercial) wastewater during the tomato processing season, and storm water during the winter.

21 20. Petitioner is informed and believes that the IWTP is an aerated lagoon system that

22 consists of six ponds on approximately 65 acres, Water delivered to the IWTP flows froin the inlet
23| through a grinder to remove tomatoes, to Pond 1 - a clay lined primary treatment pond. Water then

24 outflows to Pond 2, a clay lined settling pond. Water is then pumped from Pond 2 to either of Ponds

25 3 through 6 which are unlined percolation ponds.

26 21. Petitioner is informed and believes that depending on the time of year industrial

27 wastewater or storm water is directed to the IWTP through an existing storm drain system on South

28 Street. A diversion structure, a slide gate, at West Street and Häwkins Street is manually aligned

6 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 to send wastewater from Petitioner to the IWTP during the tomato processing season from July to

2 October. During the remainder of the year from November through June the system is aligned is for

3 stoim water to the Apricot Lane outfall and discharge to the San Benito River.

4 22. Since at least 2009, the City has required Petitioner to obtain a Permit to discharge

5 wastewater to the IWTP, and the requirements of the Permit were essentially the same through
6 2017.

7 C. Maintenance of the Ponds By Petitioner and Agreement Concerning Annual Permit

8 Fees for Sludge Removal

9 23. Petitioner is informed and believes that, during the 2014 operating season, an odor
10 problem arose at the IWTP which caused negative attention to be focused on the operation of the

11 IWTP, particularly Ponds and 2. To address this issue, Petitioner agreed to a study by

12 AquaNatural Solutions ("AquaNatural") to develop a three-year maintenance plan for the Ponds

13 designed to avoid further odor problems and reduce the volume of solids in Ponds 1 and 2.

14 24. The City rejected the AquaNatural plan and recommendations and unilaterally

15 removed a large volume of organic material from the IWTP ponds by mechanical dredging just

16 prior to SBF's 2015 operating season. Petitioner was thereafter able to enter an agreement with

17 Veolia Water North America ("Veolia"), the City's operator for the IWTP, and AquaNatural, to
18 implement a bio augmentation program for Ponds 1 and 2 and begin it during the 2015 processing

19 season, Petitioner is informed and believes that AquaNatural performed testing the following year,
20 prior to the 2016 processing season, and found that bio augmentation had resulted in a reduction of
21 solids build-up in the Ponds, A report, dated June 29, 2016, was issued by AquaNatural

22 demonstrating that the bio augmentation had resulted in a reduction of one foot of organic material
23 from the Ponds, and that the savings from not having to mechanically dredge that amount were
24 $500,000.00, The bio augmentation continued during each processing season since 2016, and
25 Petitioner is informed and believes that subsequent testing by Veola conducted prior to the 2017
26 processing season verified that over one foot of organic material had been eliminated from the
27 ponds. Despite the progress indicated in AquaNatural and Veola's studies, in 2017 the City begen
28 demanding that Petitioner pay money towards costs for future sludge removal via mechanical

7 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

dredging,

2 25. In early 2017, after the results of Veola's 2017 test were shared, Petitioner

3 committed to depositing $25,000.00 per year towards the future removal of organic material from
the ponds and to continue with the AquaNatural bio augmentation program at a cost of

5 approximately $65,000.00 per year. The City's engineer responded two days a later accepting the

6 proposition, but stated the City would require $50,000.00 per year for subsequent years.

7 26. a Petitioner. then retajned a third-party engineering consultant to conduct a further

8 study of the long-term effects of the AquaNatural bio augmentation program. The engineer

9 analyzed Petitioner's operations, correspondence between the parties, test results from AquaNatural

10 and Veola, and submitted a proposal to the City that called for three years of testing, 2018 through

11 2020, and addressed Petitioner paying $25,000.00 per year instead of $50,000.00, and noted the

12 annual cost of the AquaNatural treatments. The City agreed to the three-year study and issued
13 Permits pursuant to it in 2018 and 2019. Petitioner, in reliance on the City's agreement, retained
14 the consultant, paid the $25,000.00 each year, applied AquaNatural products to the Ponds, and

15 entered into contracts for the processing seasons based upon the agreement. Preliminary test results
16 from the study in 2019 indicate there has been no additional build-up of sludge in Ponds 1 or 2.

17 D. The Project

18 27. Petitioner is informed and believes that, on or around July 26, 2016, the mechanical

19 slide gate on West Street deteriorated and failed allowing wastewater to go through the downstream

20 drainage channel instead of to the IWTP ag intended. The discharge did not reach the San Beaito

21 Rive: and the City was able to capture it and transport it to the IWTP. The City then installed

22 temporary plug as a short-term remedy to the failure, but in September 2016, the plug failed and

23 allowed wastewater to flow to the San Benito River, a water of the United States.

24 28. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Central Coast Regional Water Quality

25 Control Board ("Regional Board") was notified of the incidents, issued a Notice of Violation

26 ("NOV") to the City, and entered into negotiations with the City to redress the slide gate failure and

27 formulate a method a to prevent it from happening in the future. The City replaced the failed slide

28 gate and installed an additional slide gate on West Street in response to the NOV.

8 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 29. Petitioner is informed and believes that in December 2019, the Regional Board
2 provided the City with SETTLEMENT. AGREEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL
3 LIABILITY ORDER NO. R3-2019-0004 ("Order"). The Order, at Section III number 19, issued a

4 discretionary penalty of $181,110.00 as a civil liability, and a set forth how, pursuant to a settlement
and stipulation, the City was only obligated to immediately pay $90,555.00, and that the remaining
6 $90,555.00 in fines would be suspended upon completion of an Enhanced Compliance Action
("ECA"), which consisted of the Project. The City was not, however, required to complete the

8 Project, and if it chose to not to pursue the Project, which was estimated to cost $1,600,000.00, or

9 failed to complete the Project after starting it, then the City would have to pay the remaining fine

10 amount, The Project requires compliance with CEQA, and is phased into several tasks, including

11 environmental review, with timeline requirements, however, the City can request extensions.

12 30. The City has retained Wallace Group Engineering ("Wallace") as a consultant for

13 the Project, and has allocated funds to it to prepare plans and specifications for constructing the
14 project.

15 31. Petitioner is informed and believes that the City has also retained an environmental
16 consultant. Petitioner is not however, aware of any environmental analysis that has been completed,
17 | but has been provided with the "Proposal" the City has received for the environmental review. The
18 Proposal admits that there will be siguificant environmental effects, It states that proceeding with

19 the Project can "affeot sensitive biological resources" and "consultation with the agencies as the

20 initial study is being prepared will assist in determining" impacts of the Project, and then provides

21 that it is "anticipated" the Project will qualify for a "mitigated negative deelaration."

22 32. Petitioner is informed and believes that the City commissioned an economio study
23 which provides that the City plans to develop the Project,

24 33. The City has provided Petitioner with its Project timeline. Environmental review is
25 not scheduled to conclude until September 28, 2020 and construction from December 29, 2020

26 through May 31, 2021. is This schedule is based on an impermissible pre-determination of the scope
27 of the CEQA document.

28 ///

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 E. 2020 Permit Discussions and Acts in Significant Furtherance of the Project Which

2 Foreclose Environmental Review, including Alternatives or Mitigation Measures.

3 34. During the first quarter of 2020 City Staff, including Mike Chambless, Management
4 || Services Director and Kari Wagner of Wallace Group Engineering, engaged in meetings with

5 Petitioner's Plant Manager, Sam Humphrey, and its engineering consultant. On April 7, 2020, Mr.

6 Humphrey received a telephone call from Chambless, who told him that the City Council had met

7 on Monday evening, April 6, 2020, in closed session which effectively purposefully estopped

8 Petitioner from participating, and voted to add many additional requirements to the 2020 Permit

9 that City had not previously discussed with Petitioner. The following week, on April 15, 2020,
10 Kari Wagner transmitted a revised copy of the draft 2020 operating permit which was ".based on

11 comments from City Council."

12 35. The revised Permit contained several changes, most notably in regards to
13 requirements concerning sludge removal. New sludge removal requirements included: the City's

14 erroneous assumption that any sludge attributable to domestic sources had been removed and all

15 remaining sludge was solely from the Petitioner's operations; the requirement that Petitioner would
16 have to pay $3,500,000.00 to $4,500,000.00 to remove the remaining sludge from Ponds 1 and 2;

17 and that Petitioner could accomplish this by making partial payments of as a little as $2,225,000.00

18 so long as liens against Petitioner's real property in California were granted to the City. The revised

19 pormit also required that: Petitioner to pay for alterations to Ponds 1, 3, and 4 so that they could be
20 solely used to treat wastewater; be financially responsible for the treatment of salts or nitrates in

21 groundwater under the IWTP - regardless of their source; and pay for an economic feasibility study

22 concerning common particles found in groundwater. Until April 15, 2020, with the exception of

23 Mr. Chambless's phone call, Petitioner had received absolutely no prior communication from

24 anyone associated with the City that any significant changes to the draft 2020 Permit were being

25 contemplated by the City.

26 36. Petitioner then communicated with City representatives about the changes, and
27 prepared a "mark-up" of the draft for the City and sent it to Ms. Wagner. Several weeks later, on
28 May 6, 2020, Ms. Wagner emailed Mr. Humphrey advising him that the City Council had met,

10 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 again in closed session, and directed edits to the draft 2020 operating permit, Ms. Wagner provided

2 to Petitioner a copy of the revised Permit. This revised Permit, which was drafted prior to any

3 compliance with CEQA, stated that: the "City is converting Pond 2 to a stormwater(sic) Pond in 2

4 Spring 2021" (emphasis added); all sludge had to be removed at a cost of $2,000,000.00; and

5 Petitioner could make a partial payment of $1,000,000.00 if it granted the City a lien against its

6 Property, That evening Petitioner had its counsel contact the City Attorney, Jason Epperson, via
letter voicing objections to the further revised 2020 Permit, A. prompt response was not received,

8 and on May 14th, 2020, Petitioner prepared a "mark-up" of the revised 2020 operating permit and

9 transmitted it to Ms. Wagner.

10 37. On May 22, 2020, the City Attorney sent correspondence stating the City's intent to

11 bifurcate the treatment of wastewater and storm water, to no longer treat industrial wastewater but

12 allow Petitioner to do so if it leases the IWTP, and the need to remove organic material from Pond

13 2 because improvements are to be made to it and ancillary facilities to treat storm water. Petitioner's

14 counsel responded to the letter on May 26, 2020. After a not receiving a response, Petitioner's

15 counsel again sent correspondence on June 4, 2020, seeking to resolve disagreements concerning

16 the 2020 Permit, and requesting that the fee be $25,000.00 as agreed,

17 38. On June 10, 2020, Mr. Humphrey discussed the 2020 Permit with Mr. Chambless
18 and with Mr. Jim Heitzman of Veola. During this convorsation Mr. Chambless stated that Mr.

19 Epperson had received Mr. Weiland's June 4th letter, that he did not think the City Council would

20 accept the proposal because the City Council has made it very cleär that it will only accept the May

21 6, 2020 version of the permit, but the City Council would discuss Mr. Weiland's June 4th letter on
22• Monday June 15, 2020, again in closed session.

23 39. The Permit together with comments about the City requiring it constitute significant

24 steps and the commitment of irrevocable resources towards modifying Ponds 1, 3 and 4 so that they

25 can be used solely to treat wastewater, and modifying Ponds 2, 5 and 6 so that they 5 can be used to

26 treat storm water. By taking these steps the City has avoided environmental review, avoided the

27 necessity of review alternatives and mitigation measures as well as avoiding the public scrutiny and
28 allowing Petitioners a fair hearing before the City Council.

11 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

F. The Monetary Demands to Petitioner Effectively Denies it the Permit and Irreparably

2 Causes it Harm, as well as to its Customers, Employees. Farmers, those in need, and

3 the Economy.

4 40, Because Petitioner cannot afford to pay the millions of dollars demanded by the

5 City, the condition operates to deny Petitioner a 2020 Permit, thereby causing Petitioner to lose the

6 use of its facility for the 2020 processing season.

7 41, Closure of Petitioner's facility would result in 90 year-round employees losing their
8 jobs and the loss of 445 seasonal job positions. Petitioner is informed and believes that the potential
9 loss of an additional 223 year-round and 1,120 season job positions indirectly supported by

10 Petitioner will also result. The income loss equates to $9,300,000.00 in lost wages to employees,

11 and, Petitioner is informed and believes, a potential $16,550,000.00 in lost wages to those indirectly
12 supported by Petitioner, for total lost wages of $25,854,000,

13 42. Petitioner is under contract for the 2020 processing season for 192,500 tons of
14 tomatoes with growers in the Central Valley, inoluding San Benito County and Santa Clara County,
15 There are no other tomato processing facilities close enough to handle this contractual commitment,
16  which will likely cause a loss to farmers in excess of $14,000,000.00 for unsold tomatoes.

17 43. In regards to food availability, Petitioner's closure will result in a significant
18 decrease in the amount of food available for SNAP and Feeding America.

19 44. Petitioner is informed and believes that, in regards to the economy, in addition to
20 lost revenue, the closure of Petitioner will result in:

21 a. Loss of $202,800,000 in gross business revenues within the Central Valley; and,

22 b. $1,037,430.00 in lost sales and property taxes.

23 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

24 45. Because the City has failed to comply with CEQA and failed to provide the public
25 | meetings that are required under CEQA and the Governmient Code, Petitioner has been estopped

26 from participating in an administrative process related to the City Council's decisions and
27 commitment of resources that constitutes a tacit approval of the Project. This implied approval
28 process forecloses the appropriate environmental review and the failure to review alternatives or

12 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of the Project. (Cal.Code Regs.,

2 tit. 14, §.15004, subd. (b)(2)(B); Save Tara v. City of W. Hollywood, (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138

3 39 ("Tara")

4 46. To the extent possible giveni the lack of public meetings, other public review, and

5 process, the issues raised in this Petition were raised by the Petitioners or other members of the

6 public or public agencies prior to and after the City advanced the Project.

7 47. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with the Public Resources Code section
8 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112. The discretionary decisions made by the City Council,
which have caused the City to take the action that significantly furthered the Project in a manner

10 that forecloses alternatives and mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review
11 of the Project, occurred in April, 2020. Previous discretionary acts and conduct by the City Council

12 constitute circumstances that illustrate the City has approved the Project as of April 6, 2020.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of CEQA)

15 48. Petitioner and. Ms. Jimenez incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 47,
16 | inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

17 49. "The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act 'to be
18 interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within

19 the reasonable scope of the statutory language.'" (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of

20 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390, citing Friends of Mammoth v. Board of

21 Supervisors (1975) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259.) Through CEQA, the Legislature intended that "all agencies

22 of the state government which regulate activities of private individuals, coxporations, and public.

23 agencies which are found to affect the quality of the enviroument, shall regulate such activities so
24 that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage . . ." (Pub. Res. Code
25 $21000(g).) CEQA's scope, however, is not unlimited. Under Public Resources Code Section
26 (21080(a), CEQA only applies to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by

27 public agencies."

28 50. This Project is a discretionary "project" that has the potential to create significant

13 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 impacts as confirmed by (1) the provisions of the Order, that the City agreed to, which state the
2 Project is not required but provide for compliance with CEQA if the Project is performed, and (2)

3 the Proposal the City received for environmental services.

4 51. The City has in fact violated the terms of the Order which requires CEQA

5 compliance, Attachment B, Section 9 entitled Project Compliance with CEQA provides:

0 The project will include environmental review in compliance with CEQA/NEPA

7 requirements. The environmental review requirements will be determined during

O. 00 the engineering study phase, This Task will require City Council approval.
28(tii) Certification that Work Performed on ECA Met or Exceeded Requirements of California' Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and other Environmental Laws

10 [where applicable] Certification that the ECA meets or exceeds the requirements of CEQA and/or other environmental laws. Unless the City is exempted from

11 compliance with CEQA, the City shall, before the ECA implementation date,

12 consult with other interested State Agencies regarding potential impacts of the ECA. To ensure compliance with CEQA where necessary, the City shall provide

13 the Central Coast Water Board with the following documents:
A, Categorical or statutory exemptions;

14 B. Negative Declaration if there are no "significant" impacts;

15 C. Mitigated Negative Declaration if there are potential "significant"
impacts but revisions to the project have been made or may be made to

16 avoid or mitigate those potential significant impacts; D. Environmental Impact Report if there are "significant" impacts.

17 52, Not only has the City violated the Order by not complying with CEQA, but based

18 on the proposal that was circulated, the schedule indlicates that the City has impermissibly pre-
19 determined which CEQA documents are applicable. In addition to foregoing the full environmental
20 review of the process, a public agency must not "fake any action" that significantly furthers : project

21 "in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of

22 CHQA review of that public project" before it completes its environmental review. (Cal.Code Regs.,

23 tit. 14, § 15004, subd. (b)(2)(B); Save Tara v. City of W. Hollywood, (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138-

24 39 ("Tara"), accord, Concerned McCloud Citizens v. McCloud Community Services District (2007)
25 147 Cal.App.4th 181; Citizens for Responsible Government, supra, 56 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1221.)

26 53.

27 The issuance of the draft Permit and the related closed session decisions, together
with comments by City staff fhat the City Council is requiring the impermissibly conditioned draft
28 permit, constitute significant steps and discretionary decisions towards the Project. Moreover,

14 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

pursuant to documents prepared by the City's consultant and other acts aS described above, the
2 circumstances show the City has already decided to proceed with the Project, including modifying

3 Ponds 1,3 4 and 4 so that they can be used solely to treat wastewater, and modifying Ponds 2, 5 and
6 SO that they can be used to treat storm water, and thereby foreclose the no Project alternative.

54. By engaging in the above acts without completing its environmental review, the City

6 has violated CEQA by failing to:

a. Determino whother the Project was a project subject to CEQA.

8 b. Engage in initial study to identify potential impacts from:

9 i. traffic from the Projeot;

10 ii. air quality from the Project;

11 iii. greenhouse gasses from the Project;

12 iv. groundwater from the Project; and

13 V. blight thaf might be caused by the potential closure of the plant,

14 C. Analyze cumulative impacts that will arise from the Project directly and indirectly.

15
• d. Examine alternatives to the Project,

16 e. Advise the public of the Project so that they could engage in meaningful discussion

17 and provide information concerning the same.

18 55. One of the potential significant impacts reviewed under CEQA is whether the

19 Project is consistent with the General Plan and other Policies of the jurisdiction relevant to this

20 Project. Because there has not been CEQA review, it is not clear whether the Project, as proposed,
21 is consistent with documents such as City's and County's General Plan, the Hollister Urban Area
22 Water and Wastewater Master Plan and the City of Hollister Sewer System Management Plan.

23 56. As a result of the above acts, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and
24 failed to comply with CEQA. Accordingly, Respondents acts in furtherance of the Project should
25  be set aside pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1085, 1094.5 and Public Resources Code 21167,
26 21168, and a 2020 Permit without cost demands that are related to the Project should be issued to

27 Petitioner.

28 ///

15 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of the Brown Act)

57. Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 47,
4 inclusive, as though fully set forth herein. A

58. Respondent has a clear, present duty to comply with CEQA and provide a public

6 forum for review of its overall decision-making process.

59. The Ralph M. Brown Act (Brown Act) (Gov. Code, §54950 et seg.) requires
meetings of "legislative bodies" of local agencies to be open and public. (Gov. Code, §54953(a).),

9 "[t]he people have the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's
10 business, and, therefore, the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and

11 agencies shall be open to public scrutiny." Cal Const art I, §3(b)(1).

12 60. The City has violated the Brown Act by not providing public forum, by including
13 decision-making regarding the approval of this Project in closed session, and by not providing
14 public notice of those decisions,

15 61. Because of these fallures to comply with the law, Respondent has abused its
16 | discretion. As a result, the City should be required to rescind its actions implementing the Project

17 and either issue to Petitioner an Operating Permit for the 2020 tomato processing season pursuant

18 to the prior agreement between the City and Petitioner, or extend the 2019 permit until City lawfully

19 complies with its public duties.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of the Mitigation Fee Act and Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine)

22 62. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 47, inclusive, as though

23 fully set forth herein.

24 63. By denying the Petitioner its permit, and attempting to coerce unreasonable and
25  overreaching fees it knows Petitioner cannot afford, the City has engaged in a taking.

26 64. The denial of the permit based on unreasonable payment conditions will prohibit the

27 Petitioner from using its operty and interfere with the vested rights that it has in its agreement
28 concerning annual fees for sludge removal, and the fees and payments previously made to the City

16 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

with respect to the facility, These unlawful conditions violate the State's Mitigation Fee Act and

2 case law related thereto, and the Federal Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine.

3 65. California's Mitigation Fee Act, Government Code Sections 66000-66025, requires

4 a local regulatory authority to demonstrate a "reasonable relationship" between the proposed use of

5 a development fee, or other monetary exaction, and both the type of devélopment project and the

6 need for the public facility and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed. (Gov.

7 Codee $66001(a)(3), (4).) It specifically contains provisions that apply to sewer connections which

8 are not to exceed reasonable costs and must "bear[s] a fair or reasonable relationship to the payer's

9 burdens on, or benefits-received from, the water connection or sewer connection. (Cal. Gov't Code

10 § 66013(b)(5).)

11 66. The California Supreme Court has determined that the heightened scrutiny of
12 development conditions required by the U.S. Supreme Court's Nollan and Dolan opinions applies
13 to development conditions that require payment of a monetary fee in cases where the governmental

14 conditions requiring monetary exactions are imposed on an individual and discretionary basis,
15|| rather than generally or ministerially. (Ehrlich v. City of Culver City (1996) 12 Cal.4th 854, 875-
16 876.)

17 67. The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions limits the government's power to require

18 one to surrender a constitutional right in exchange for a discretionary benefit. (Beach & Bluff
19 Conservancy v. City of Solana Beach, (Ct. App. 2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 244, 266.) It applies only

20 where the condition at issue constitutes an "exaction" in the form of either the conveyance of

21 property interest or the payment of money; the doctrine does not apply where the government

22 simply restricts the use of property without demanding an exaction, (California Building Industry

23 Assn, V, City of San Jose (2015) 61 Cal.4th 435, 457, 460.) The United States Supreme Court has

24 held "the government may a impose such a condition only when the government demonstrates that
25 there is an 'essential nexus' [citation] and 'rough proportionality' [oitation] between the required

26 dedication and the projected impact of the proposed land use." (San Diego County Water Authority
27 V. Metropolilan Water District of Southern California (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1124, 1158;

-28 California Building Industry Assn. v. City of San Jose (2015) 61 Cal.4th 435, 457.) Nollan v. Cal.

17 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Coastal Com, (1987) 483 U.S. 825 .(Nollan) and Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) 512 U.S. 374
2| (Dolan).) This test for determining whether a condition is unconstitutional is commonly referred

3 to as the "Nollan/Dolan test' (see Callfornia Building, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 458-459), and is
4 viewed as a type of "heightened scrutiny."

5 68. Dolan provides that a regulatory a. a condition on a building permit operates as an
6 unconstitutional taking when there is not an "essential nexus" between a legitimate state interest
7 and the permit conditions.

8 69. Any exaction demanded by the permit must bear a sufficient relationship a to the

9 proposed development's impact.

10 70. The fees being imposed by the City as a condition for the 2020 Operating Permit do

11 not satisfy the rough proportionality and "essential nexus" requirements of the Nollan/Dolan tests,
12 which are also utilized by the state in determining the legitimacy of fees under the Mitigation Fees

13 Act.

14 71, The regulatory actions taken by the Respondents may result in Petitioners being.

15 deprived of all economically beneficial or productive use of their property and may result in the
16 involuntary closing of their business.

17 72. The application of monetary conditions of the Permit will prohibit the Petitioner

18 from using its property and interfere with the vested rights thät it has in the previous contract and

19 the fees and payments made to the City with respect to the facility.

20 73, By denying the Petitioner its permit via unreasonable and overreaching fees in

21 excess of $2,000,000.00 that the City knows Petitioner cannot afford, the City has engaged in a

22 taking that violates the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine and the Mitigation fee act.

23 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Breach of Contract)

25 74. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 47, inclusive, as though
26| fully set forth herein.

27 75, In 2017, the City and Petitioner entered into the agreement with respect to studies

28 and a fee requirement for Permits through the year 2020,

18 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- 76.

2 Petitioner has performed all that is required of it under its agreement with the City
and duly offered to perform its duties thereunder for the year 2020.

3 77.

4 The City however has breached the 2017 agreement with Petitioner by demanding

5 that it pay $2,500,000.00 to remove sludge as a condition a for the 2020 Operating Permit instead of

6 the agreed upon $25,000.00. Petitioner is informed and believes that the City has also breached the

7 covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the agreement by attempting to engage in the
Project as part

8 of an effort to deprive.Petitioner of its benefit under the bargain and put Petitioner

9 out of business in spite of Petitioner's reliance on the agreement, Petitioner reserves its right to
allege tortious interference of contract as to members of the City Council pending discovery in this

.10 matter.

11 78.

12 The City's breach of the agreement has been a substantial factor in causing harm to
Petitioner in an amount to be proven at trial.

13 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Declaratory Relief)

15 79. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 47, inclusive, as though
16 fully set forth herein,

17 80. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and Respondents
18 concerning their respective rights and duties in that Petitioner contends that the action taken in

19 furtherance of the Project should be withdrawn so that proper environmental review can occur, and
20 that Permit should issue to Petitioner in conformance with the agreement between Petitioner and

21 the City.

22 81. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
23  circumstances of this matter in order that Petitioners may ascertain the rights and duties of the
24 parties and the validity of the transaction involving the Project.

25. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Injunctive Relief)

27 82. Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 47,
28  inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

19 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 83, Petitioner possesses property rights and/or interests of the kind for which injunctive
2  relief is available to protect, including being resident of the City, a Property owner in the City, and

3 a party who will be impacted by the Project.

4 84. The City's engagement in the Project without undertaking proper environmental

5 review and related approvals, without engaging in public discourse, and attempting to obtain
6 additional fees from Petitioner, invades, infringes and/or interferes with Petitioner's protectable

7 rights and interest.

8 85. The City's failure to issue a 2020 Permit, a or extend the 2019 permit, despite

9 Petitioner meeting the terms of its prior agreement with the City, interferes with Petitioner's

10 protectable rights and interests, and subjects members of the public to loss of a valuable food source

11 during a global pandemic and state of emergency, and to protect Petitioner's participation in needed

12 government food programs,

13 86. Respondent's conduct, unless and until enjoined and restrained by order of this

14 court, will cause great and irreparable injury to Petitioners and to the oitizens of City of Hollister

15 and the County of San Benito, because the Project does not comply with CEQA or state law.

16 87. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law and it would be impossible for

17 Petitioners to determine the precise amount of any damages.

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez pray judgment against Respondents, and each
20 of them, as follows;

21 1. As to all Causes of Action herein, that this court enter judgment determining or
22 declaring that the approval of Project by Respondents was illegal and therefore is null and void,

23 2. As to all Causes of Action, that this court enter a preliminary injunction (a) requiring

24 the City to issue the 2020 permit with no additional conditions regarding the Project, or enjoin the

25 City from prohibiting discharges to the IWTP so long as Petitioner meets requirements contained

26 in the 2019 Permit until such time as the City complies with its duties under CEQA and the Brown

27 Act, and (b) restrain Respondents from granting any permits for or executing any agreements
28 relating to the Project, or otherwise approving any development, demolition, construction, or other

20 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 activities or undertaking pursuant to or in furtherance of the Project, pending the court's judgment

2 on the matters raised herein.

3, Under First Cause of Action (Violation of CEQA) herein, Petitioner and Ms.

4 Jimenez request that this court enter judgment determining or declaring that respondents failed to

5 comply with CBQA and therefore the approval of the Project was illegal and is null and void.

6 4, Under the First Cause of Action (Violation of CEQA) and Second Cause of Action

7 (Violation of the Brown Act) herein, Petitioner and Ms, Jimenez request that a Writ of Mandate be

8 issued demanding and ordering Respondents to complete the CBQA environmental review process

9 by preparing an adequate Environmental Impact Report or Mitigated Negative Declaration, and

10 engage in public review regarding the saino before engaging in acts in significant furtherance of the

11 Project such as conditioning Petitioner's 2020 Permit on paying $2,500,000.00 for sludge removal,

12 and other modifications to the IWTP.

13 5, Under the Third Cause of Action (Violation of the Mitigation Fee Act and

14 Unconstitutional Condition Doctrine [takingl), Petitioner requests that a Writ of Mandate be issued

15 demanding and ordering that Respondents not condition Petitioner's 2020 Permit on paying
16 $2,500,000.00 for sludge removal and other modifications to the IWTP that do not have a direct
17 nexus to Petitioner's operations.

18 6. Under the Fourth Cause of Action (Breach of Contract) herein, Petitioner requests

19 that the City be liable to Petitioner for all damages which result from the City's breach of contract
20 | to issue an operating permit.

21 7. Under the Fifth Cause of Action (Declaratory Relief) herein, Petitioner requests that

22 a declaration that Respondents have failed to comply with CEQA and that an operating permit
23 should issue to Petitioner,

24 8. Under the Sixth Cause of Action (Injunctive Relief - Request for Stay) herein,
25 Petitioner and Ms. Jimenez request a stay and/or permanent injunction enjoining Respondents from
26 pursuing, completing or performing any act implementing the Project without furst engaging in the
27 analysis required by CEQA, and that a Permit with the same conditions as the 2019 permit issue to

28 Petitioner so that it can operate its business from July 2020 to November 2020.

21 PETITION AND COMPLAINT

9 For reasonable attorney's fees, including but not limited to fees authorized under
