1 Higuera Project (*Project"). The City approved the Project on June 2, 2020 by adopting

2 Resolution No. 11128 (2020 SERIES), thereby denying the Petitioner's appeal of the Planning
Commission's approval of application ARCH-0017-2019 for the Project.
2. Petitioner contends the City's approval of the Project must be set aside because (1)
4 the City's conclusion that the Project is exempt from CEQA was abuse of discretion, (2) the
5 Project is inconsistent with San Luis Obispo City Design Guidelines and Conservation and Open
6 Space Element, and (3) the City violated the City's own Historical Preservation Ordinance when it

7 failed and refused to refer the Projoct to the Cultural Heritage Committee ("CHC*) for analysis,

8 advice and recommendations.
3.
9 In addition to the foregoing, SLAP! asks this court to judicially declare that the
City's practice of relying on a so-called matrix to determine whether to refer a project to the CHC
10| violates the City's owna Historic Preservation Ordinance.
11 II. THC PARTIES

12 4. Petitioner and Complainant, SLAPI, is a San Luis Obispo unincorporated

13 association dedicated to the preservation of historically signifieant and notable architecture in the

14 City of San Luis Obispo. SLAPI brings this action on its own behalf, for its members, and in the
public interest.
15 5, Respondent and Defendant, CITY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO, is a local governmental
16 agency with the authority to regulate and administer land use and development within the City of
17|| San Luis Obispo, but only in compliance with the duly adopted provisions of its zoning
18 ordinances, General Plan, Community Plans, Municipal Code and all applicable provisions of state.
19 law, including CEQA, the Planning and Zoning law, and the Subdivision Map Act. The City is the

20 lead agency for the Project within the meaning of CEQA. The City is respönsible for insuring that

21 the agencies, instrumentalities, officials, and employees of the City comply with the Laws of the
State of California. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF SAN LUIS OBISPO (the *City Coúncil") is
22 the legislative body and highest administrative body in the City. The City Council has the
23 authority to approve or disapprove proposed development applications and other land use
24 entitlements.

25 6. Petitioner does not know the identity of DOES 1-25 but will amend the Petition as

.26 required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a defendant if the identity, interest,

27 and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

#intelon iccopclid fhpie

7. According to the City's Notice of Exemption, the Project Applicant is Taylor

2 Judkins. Accordingly, Petitioner is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Taylor
Judkins is a Real Party in Interest by virtue of being the project applicant and the recipient of
3 project approval(s) and having an ownership interest in the subject of this litigation.
8. Petitioner does not know the identity of ROES 26-50 but will amend the Petition as
5 required to specifically identify each such person or entity as a real party in interest if the identity,
6 interest and capacity of such party, if any, becomes known.

7 III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
9, Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

9 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,
submitting written comments on the issues that are the subject of this lawsuit during the
10 administrative process. Petitioner submitted detailed written and aral comments informing the 11 City that the Project is not exempt from CEQA; therefore, any further attempts to pursue

12 administrative remedies would be futile.

13 10. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ("Pub.

14 Res. Code") § 21167.5 by mailing written notice of the commencement of this action to

15 Respondents prior to filing this petition and complaint. A true and correct copy of this notice is
attached hereto as Exhibit "A*.
16 11. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code $21167.7 and
17 | Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by mailing a.copy of the Petition/Complaint to the state Attorney
18 General.
19 12. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

20 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the

21 Project approvals until they have adequately complied with CEQA and its own eode and design
guidelines. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approvals will remain in effect and in
22 violation of CEQA,
23 13. If the City is not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking acts in
24 furtherance thereof, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy 25 at law in that the Project area and surrounding area would be irrevocably altered and significant

26 adverse impacts on the environment and community would result. Petitioner and the general

27 public will also be harmed by the City's failure to comply with the City's own guidelines and

regulations.
14.
2 In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting

3 the general public and residents of San Luis Obispo, Petitioner will be entitled to attorneys' fees
and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure $1021.5,
15. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Public Resources Code §21168 and
§21168.5, as well as Code of Civil Procedure §1085 or §1094,5, which require that an agency's
6 approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial
abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by

8 law or where its determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents
have prejudicially abused their discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to
9 the law, and their decision approving the Project is not supported by substantial evidence.
10 16, Petitioner also seeks declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $1060.
11 TV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 17. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Public Resources Code g

13 21000 et seq., including Public Resources Code $8 21167, 21168 and 21168.5; 14 Cal. Code Regs.

14 § 15122 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"); Code of Civil Procedure 88 1085 and 1094.5; the
Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and all other
15 applicable laws including Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 1085 and 1094.5.
16 18. The Court has jurisdiction over SLAPI's claim for declaratory relief pursuant to
17 Code of Civil Procedure §1060.

18 19, Venue is proper in this Court because the action concerns real property and à

19 proposed project located in the City of San Luis Obispo, in San Luis Obispo County.

20 V. STATEMENT OF FACTS
A.
21 Project Description and Setting
20. The Project is a mixed-use project consisting of two 54-foot buildings connected by
22 an unenclosed bridge on the fourth floor. Parking would be provided within a ground-floor garage,
23 and surface parking spaces (totaling 74 vehicle spaces). The Project site is zoned Retail
24 Commercial and. Downtown Commercial.

25 21. At. 54-fcet, the buildings are essentially six-stories high. By comparison, the Project

26 is larger than the new terminal at San Luis Obispo Airport and 50 times the size of its single-story

27 historie neighbor. Owing to its incompatible massing, size, scale and architectural features, the

28 PÉTITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Vrtkted en Roéydtst upor

N Project would overwhelm the adjacent Master List Robert Pollard House, Master List David

2 Norcross House, and historie Antonio Pinho House.
22.
3 The Project's surrounding streets of Nipomo, Higuera, Carmel, and Marsh contain a

4 greater concentration of Master List and National Register of Historic Places (*NRHP**) properties

5 and Master List- and NRHP-eligible properties than any of our currently designated historic

6 districts, and more than twice as many as the Mill Street Historic District. These include the NRHP

7 Jack House and Jack Wash House; Master List Kaetzel House and Downtown Creamery; Master
List-eligible Logan Apartments/Racing Stable, Queen Anne Henry House, Neoclassic Lima

8 House, Craftsman Howey Kit Bungalow, Pueblo Revival Firpo Duplex, industrial vernacular
Negranti Packard Repair Shop, and Streamline Moderne Campbell Refrigeration Building; and
NRHP-eligible Craftsman Wilkinson House, vernacular Jack Carriage House, and Gardenesque
10 Jack Garden.
11 23. This modest neighborhood is currently undergoing a rapid rate of development with
12 a matching cumulative impact on historic resources unmatched by any other in San Luis Obispo in

13 any other time,

14 24. Project Building "A" consists of 3,198 square feet of retail space fronting Higuera

15 Street; three studio units (448 to 530 square feet in size), six one-bedroom units (671 to 874 square

16 feet in size), and three two-bedroom units (938 to 1,001 square feet in size); eight hotel suites (372
to 1,260 square feet in size); wrap-around walkways and decks; private balconies; and a long-term
17 bicycle storage room.
18 25.

19 Project Bullding "B* consists of 2,043 square feet of retail space fronting Marsh
Street; five studio units (447 to 629 square feet in size), 14 one-bedroom units (700 to 807 square

20 feet in size), and eight two-bedroom units (798 to 1,174 square feet in size); wrap- around

21 walkways and decks; a 705- square foot roof deck on the fourth floor; private balconies; and an

22 enclosed garage and three-level mechanical parking lift (48 spaces).
26. The Project is proposed to be constructed in phases. According to a staff report,
23 "[t]he first phase would consist of the construction of Building B, followed by the construction of
24 Building A."

25 27.

26 According to a 2019 Historic Preservation Report ("Historic Report") prepared for
the City in connection with the Project, five parcels in the immediate project area are occupied by

27 buildings that are included on the City's Master List of Historie Resources (Table 1). Of these five.

properties, one--the Jack House (1878)-is also listed on the National Register of Historic Placcs,
One additional property within the neighborhood---Pinho House (circa 1887)-is a significant
example of early residential development typical of the neighborhood.
3 28. A staff report describes the Project's vicinity as containing a mosaic of historically
4. significant buildings. "Historic structures in the immediate vicinity include the Pollard House
5 (adjacent to the site, to the southwest), the Norcross House (across Higuera Street, to the north),
6 and the Jack House and Gardens (approximately 100 feet to the east)."
29. Regarding the Pollard House, which is located immediately adjacent to the Project
site, the Historic Report explains that "[tlhe adjacency, height, mass, and design (and, to a lesser
extent, the materials) of the proposed development (especially of the building at 545 Higuera
Street) would completely dominate the neighboring Pollard House and would greatly impact its
10 integrity of setting, feeling, and association." (Historic Report at p. 19, emphasis added).
11 30. Regarding the Norcross House, the Historic Report explains that "[a]long with the
12| Pollard House, the Norcross House will bear the brunt of project impacts to the integrity of setting,

13 feeling, and association. Considering that the Norcross House has already been subject to a slight

14 loss of integrity of location (from being moved closer to Higuera Street) and a severe loss of

15 integrity of design, materials, workmanship, setting, feeling, and association (from its own on-site
redevelopment project), the impacts from the proposed project witi constitute additional
16 cumulative impacts. (Historie Report at p. 20).
17 31. According to the Historic Report, the Jack House will also be affected by the
18 Project, but not to the same extent: "[t]o the extent that these partial views [of the Project]

19 introduce large-scale modern elements at very close range to the NRHP-listed historical property,

20 the visual intrusion would constitute a loss of integrity (probably only minor) to the Jack House

21 setting, feeling, and association but would not impair its integrity of location, design, materials, or
workmanship.*(Historic Report at p. 22).
22 32. The Project must comply with multiple levels of City guidelines and regulations,
23| including the General Plan, Zoning Regulations, Community Design Guidelines ("CDG") and
24 other applicable City development standards. As set forth more fully below, the parties disagrce as
25 to which regulations and guidelines apply to the Project.

B. Procedural History
33. The City's Architectural Review Committee ("ARC") considered the Project on
September 9, 2019 and October 21, 2019. The purview of the ARC is a project's consistency with
the CDG. The ARC voted to recommend approval of the project but directed the Applicant to
4 incorporate a number of changes.
34. The Planning Commission also considered the Project. On January 8, 2020, after
6 conducting a hearing, the Planning Commission directed the Applicant to revise the Project in
order to make the Project more consistent with several provisions of the CDG, including CDG 1.1

8 (Purpose of the Design Quidelines), 1.4 (Goals for Design Quality and Character), 3.1.A.3
Commercial Project Design Guidelines, Overall Design Objectives), and 3.1,B.2 (General
Architectural Design Guidelines).
10 35. Notwithstanding the fact that the Project was not revised to comply with its own
11 previous directions, the Planning Commission approved the Project at its next meeting with no
12| additional design moditications. Without any discussion, the Planning Commission agreed with the

13 Planning Staff's recommendation that the Project qualifies for a Class 32 exemption as an In-Fill

14 Development Project. CEQA Guidelines § 15332.
36.
15 SLAPI timely appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the City Council
and submitted extensive comments and legal and factual analysis in support of the appeal. Without
16 any adequate discussion or analysis, the City Council dismissed the appeal and approved the
17 Project by adopting Resolution No. 11128 (2020 SERIES), approving application ARCH-0017-
18 2019.

19 37. The City issued a Notice of Exemption ("NOE"*) on the same evening, June 2, 2020,

20 and posted the NOE on June 3, 2010. According to the NOE, the City concluded that the presence

21 of historic resources throughout downtown San Luis Obispo and areas subject to the same policies

22 and regulations meant that circumstances of the Project were not unusual, The NOE also
concluded that "based on the project's design, which incorporates forms, step backs, setbacks,
23  landscaping, and materials found to be consistent with the General Plan and Community Design
24 Guidelines, and the initial recommendations of the historic assessment and the conclusion of the
25 Historical Compatibility Letter, the project would not result in a significant adverse impact or
26 cumulative impact to historical resources as defined by the California Environmental Quality Act."

The NOE does not refer to any contrary substantial evidence that demonstrate that the Project may

2 have a substantial indirect and cumulative impact on historic resources.
CEOA Mandates
3 38. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document
and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made

5 (Pub. Resources Code § 21000), and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment
shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions."* Pub. Resources Code $21001(d). "CEQA was
intended to be interpreted in such à manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the
environment within the reasohable scope of the statutory authority." 14 California Code of
Regulations (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines") §15003(f), citing Friends of Mammoth v. Board of
Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247. "[Tjhe overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies
10 regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary consideration to
11 preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration of policy that all
12 necessary action be taken 'to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental quality of the

13 state.* Save Our Peninsula y. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99,

14 117, citing Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. y. Regents of University of California (1988) 47
Cal.3d 373, 392; Pub. Resources Code § 21000.
15 39. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project and
16 must therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study. Pub.
17 Resources Code $21080 (%), (d), $21082.2. CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an
18 Initial Study to "determine if the project may have a signifieant on the environment." 815063(a)

19 *All phases of the project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the

20 Initial Study". CEQA Guidelines §15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must

21 also consider reasonably foresecable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in
which significant effects would occur, directly or indirectly, See CEQA Guidelines §15064(d) &
22 §15360, see also Laurel Heights Improvement Assn, supra, 47 Cal. Ed at 392.
23 40. An indirect impact is a reasonably foreseeable physical change in the environment
24|| that is not immediately related to the project in time or distänce but caused indirectly by the
25 project. CEQA Guidelines $15064(d)(2) & §15358(a)(2). A lead agency may not limit

26 Ienvironmental disclosure by ignoring the development or other activity that will ultimately result

from an initial approval. City of Antioch.v. City Council (1986) 187 CA3d 1325 (emphasis
added),
2 41. Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively
defective, reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to
CEQA mandates may not have resulted in a different outcome. Pub. Resources Code §21005(a).
5 For example, the Court in Citizens 1o Preserve Qiai v.County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d
421, 428, held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental
impacts of the project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if striet compliance with

8 the mandates of CEQA would not have altered the outcome, The Court in Resource Defense Fund
Y. LAFCQ (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to comply with
9 CEQA procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau Y.
10 City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if
11 "the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed
12 public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id, at 712.

13 42. CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with

14 assurances that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its
actions." Laurel Heights Improvement Ass. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47
15 Cal.3rd 376, 392. The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely to result in
16 informed decision making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can
17 respond to an action with which they disagree. Thid.
18 43 Tn limited circumstances, an agency project approval may be exempt from CEQA if

19 it falls within-one of 33 classes of exemptions enumerated under the CBQA Guidelines. CEQA

20 Guidelines § 15061, subd. (b)(2), 9§ 15300-15333. These "categorical exemptions" are intended to

21 apply to agency project approvals that clearly fall within a predefined, specific type of activity that
has been carefully analyzed and categorically found to not have an individual or cumulative
22 significant effect on the enyironment. Pub. Resources Code § 21084, subd. (a): CEQA Guidelines
23| 815061, subd. (b)(3) (*Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the
24 activity in question may have a signiticant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to
25 CEQA.") (Emphasis added),

26 44. In general, categorical exemptions are applicable to routine agency approval

27 actions, such as those affecting an individual residence or business with no consequence on the

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Monad no Ravgelad Popr.

In surrounding community and environment. See Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors,

2 (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247 (*common sense tells us that the majority of private projects for which a

3 government permit or similar entitlement is necessary are minor in scope-e.g., relating only to the

4 construction, improvement, or operation of an individual dwelling or small business--and hence,
in the absence of unusual circumstances, have little or no effect on the public environment."). If
5 there is any "reasonable possibility" that a project or activity may have a significant effect on the
environment, an exemption is improper. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c); Wildlife Alive v.

7 Chickering, (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 205-06.

8 45. Categorical exemptions are not absolute. If there is any "reasonable possibility" that

9 a project or activity may have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption is improper.
| CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(c); Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205-06
10| ("Wildlife Alive"). A project that might otherwise be categorically exempt must nevertheless be
11 subject to comprehensive environmental review under certain "exceptional"* circumstances,
12 including the following:

13 There is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to

14 unusual circumstances (CEQA Guideline §15300.2(c));

15 Significant cumulative impacts from projects of the same type will result (CEQA

16 Guideline §15300.2(b));

17 Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which

18 may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.
(CEQA Guideline §15300.2(0);

19 46.

20 || Likewise, a project is not exempt from CEQA if the agency's conclusion that
the project will not result in any potentially significant environmental impacts is based on

21 consideration of mitigation measures. In other words, if mitigation measures are needed to avoid

22 potentially significant impacts, then, at a minimum, the agency must prepare a mitigated negative

23 declaration. See. Kostka and Zischke, Practice Under the California Environmental Quality Act,
2nd Ed., at $5.75, citing Azusa Land Reclamation Co v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster
24 (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.
25 47.

26 A project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an
historical resource is a project that may have a significant effect on the environment. Pub.

27 Resources Code $ 21084.1. Public Resources Code $21084 (e) further provides that "[a] project

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR.DECLARATORY AND INIUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

asclei Paper

that may a cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource, as specified
in Section 21084.1, shall not be exempted from [CEQA] pursuant to subdivision (a)."
48. Categorical exemptions must be strictly construed to ensure they are applied only to
the classes of projects that have been determined not to have a significant impact on the
4 environment. Azusa Land Reclamation Co v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192. See, also, Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827,

6 842 (where, as here, the agency relies on a categorical exemption, the exemption must be narrowly

7 construed).

49.
8 Where the Agency's initial determination that the Project falls within the scope of
an exception is at issue, the court must first decide as a matter of law the scope of the exemption
and "then determine if substantial evidence supports the agency's factual finding that the project
10 fell within the exemption." California Farm Bureau Fed'n y. California Wildlife Conservation Bd.
11 (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 185. The lead agency has the burden of demonstrating the project
12 falls within the scope of the exception. Ihid. "Once the agency meets this burden to establish the

13 project is within a categorically exempt class, "the burden shifts to the party challenging the

14 exemption to show that the project is not exempt because it falls within one of the exceptions listed
in Guidelines section 15300.2." Id. at 186.
15 50. CEQA does not require public agencies to follow any particular procedure in
16 approving exempt projects, or to provide notice to the public or other agencies regarding its
17 determination that the activity is exempt. Nor is the agency required to provide an opportunity to
18 review and comment on the project, or to conduct a public hearing before on its determination that

19 the project is exempt from review. San Lorenzo Valley Comm. Advocates for Responsible Ed. v.

20 San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District (2006) 139 Cal.App.4™h 1356. 1358. The agency is not

21 required to make any findings in support of an exemption determination. CalBeach Advocates v.
City of Solana Beach (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 529.
22 51. When an agency determines that project is exempt, it may, but is not required to,
23 file a notice of exemption or NOE. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21108, 21152; CEQA Guidelines §
24 15062. Filing an NOE triggers a 3 -day statute of limitations on challenges to the agency's 25 exemption determination. An NOE must be filed, if at all, after the agency approves the project.

"4.2.B,1.b. Downtown Design Guidelines: Height and Scale. New buildings that are significantly taller or shorter than adjacent buildings shall provide appropriate visual transitions.

3 The residential design guidelines apply to "the design of new residential subdivisions and to multi-
4 family and clustered residential projects"
53. The city's General Plan Land Use Element states that new buildings in
6 downtown "should be set back above the second or third level to maintain a street façade that is

7 consistent with the historic pattern of development" (Policy 4.16.4),

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Abuse of Discretion: Violation of CEQA) 10

11 54, SLAP! refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs,

12 inclusive, of this Petition as though. fully set forth herein.
55. The City abused its discretion and violated CEQA when it concluded the Project is
13 exempt from CEQA because the Project is inconsistent with several applicable City General Plan
14| policies and rules and regulations. For example, the Project is inconsistent with City Design
15 Guideline 3.2.2., according to which "[n]ew development should not sharply contrast with,
16 signiticantly block public views of, or visually detract from, the historic architectural character of

17 historically designated structures located adjacent to the property to be developed, or detract from

18 the prevailing historic architectural character of the historic district." The evidence shows the
Project sharply contrasts with, and visually detracts from historic resources, particularly the
19 Pollard House and the Norcross House. The Project is also inconsistent with Guideline 5.3.C.
20 because it is inconsistent with surrounding residential structures and is not appropriately set back
21 at upper floors from the edge of the first story to reduce impacts on smaller adjacent homes.

22 56. The City abused its discretion and violated CEQA by concluding this Project is
exempt from CBQA also because the Project is likely to cause a substantial adverse change in the
significance of "historic resources" as the term is defined under CEQA. See Pub. Resources Code

25 §21084(e) ( a project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical
resource shall not be exempted from [CEQA] pursuant to subdivision (a)), and CEQA Guideline

* 26| $15300.2(f). According to the Historic Report, the significance of a number of historic buildings
27

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELICE._.

Ardptol ao zoegydled Elepuóos

may be adversely affected by the Project which may cause them to lose eligibility for Master
listing or significance has a historic resource. In addition to the Historic Report, expert comments
of Allan Cooper, James Papp, Ph.D. and Dan Krieger support a conclusion that the Project may
cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of historic resources.
57. Contrary to the Staff's contention, "losing eligibility for listing" is not the sole
threshold for assessing a Project's potential impact on a historic resource. Moreover, a significant
impact on a historic resource or historie neighborhood or district may be purely aesthetic in nature.
See Protect Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal. App. 5th 1129.

8 58. The City abused its discretion and violated CEQA also by concluding that the
Project is not subject to CEQA Guideline §15300.2(0), which provides that a discretionary project
is not exempt from CEQA if"It]here is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the
10 environment due to unusual circumstances.' As SLAP! repeatedly explained in its comments to
11 the City, the circumstances of this Project are unusual because the Project site is literally
12 surrounded by a number of historically significant buildings that would be significantly impacted

13 by the project. The proximity of such a large number of historically significant resources that could

14 potentially be adversely affected by the Project is an unusual Project feature that is unlike any

15 typical infill project to which the Class 32 exemption would apply.
59. Owing to this unusual circumstance (i.e. the proximity of a number of historically
16 significant buildings), the Project will have a substantial adverse impact on historically significant
17 buildings, particularly the Pollard House, the Norcross House, the Pinho House, and the Jack

18 House. Accordingly, the unusual exception epplies because it can be fairly argued that owing to

19 special circumstances, the Project will cause a significant adverse environmental impact.

20 60. The City's conclusion that the project is exempt violates CEQA also because the

21 Projeot is capable of having a cumulative and aesthetic impact on historic resources. CEQA

22 Guideline §15300.2(b). The Historic Report admits the Project may exacerbate a growing trend of
multistory development in this and surrounding neighborhoods. The City's own Director of
23| Development admitted that the City-will-likely-continue to receive applications for and approve
24 similarly large and out of scale Mixed-Use developments in the project's vicinity,

25 61. The City's contention that the Project is not capable of a causing a signifieant-

26 cumulative impact on historic resources is based on a legal error. According to Staff, the Project

27 will not cause a significant cumulative-impact on-historie resources because although "combination

28 PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WAIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR, DECLARATORYAND IMUNCTIVE RELIEFEU

Feiciof ein Redys 1o0) Pugper

of other projects in the vicinity have resulted in a cumulative effect, none of the projects resulted in

2 a significant effoct." Staff's contention, which was endorsed and adopted by the City Council, is
contrary to CEQA provisions that govern agency's analysis of cumulative impacts. Staff fails to
3 recognize that significant cumulative impact can result from individually minor but collectively
4 significant projects taking place over a period of time." CEQA Guidelines, §15355(b).
5 62. Finally, the Project is not exempt from CEQA because the City's conclusion that
6 the Project would not have a significant impact on the environment is at least in part based on the

"7 mitigation measures the City imposed on the Project in order to reduce the Project's impact on

8 historical resources. These measures, such as widening of storefronts and increasing setbacks,
which are intended to *reduce or eliminate" one or more potentially significant impact on the
9 environment, are properly characterized as mitigation measures and are not project features.

14. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Abuse of Discretion: Violation of Planning and Zoning law, Land Use and Circulation Element 15 and Design Guidelines)
16 63. SLAP! refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs,
17 inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

18 64. The City's approval of' the Project must be set aside because the Project, as

19 approved, is inconsistent with a number of City Design Quidelines and provisions of the City's

20 Land Use and Circulation Element (*LUCE"T).
65.
21 The City Couneil abused its discretion by concluding that the Residential Project.
Design Guidelines do not apply to this Project solely because the Project, by virtue of being
22 located in Downtown, is subject to the provisions of the Downtown Design Guidelines. Nothing in
23 the Design Guidelines explicitly or implicitly suggests that a residential project that is located in
24 Downtown would not be subject to the Residential Design Quidelines. •*...
25 66: As explained in. SLAP!*s comments and those of one of its founding members, Dr.

26 James Papp, Ph.D., the Project as approved is inconsistent with a number of CDGs, including but

27 not limited to the following:

28 | PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRITOF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DEGLARATORY-AND INJUNGTIVE RELIER

Prentol on Rocy cedlaper

CDG, 5.4.A.1. provides that multi-family housing projects should consider the existing character of the sumrounding residential area and that new development should respect the privacy of adjacent residential uses through appropriate building orientation and stricture height. The Project as approved is incompatible with the scale and character of the existing neighborhood and does not respect the privacy of its neighbors,

5 The Project is inconsistent with CDG"4.2.B.1.b. Downtown Design Guidelines: Height and Scale. New buildings that are significantly taller or shorter than adjacent buildings shall provide appropriate visual transitions." The Project as approved is significantly taller than adjacent buildings without providing appropriate visual transitions.

9 67, The Project is inconsistent with General Plan Land Use Element Policy 4.16.4

10 which requires new buildings Downtown to "be set back above the second or third level to
maintain a street façade that is consistent with the historic pattern of development.* 11

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment agalnst Respondents, as set forth herein
13 below.
14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
15. (Abuse of Discretion: Violation of Historic Preservation Ordinance)
16 68. SLAPI refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding paragraphs,
17 inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.
18 69. Consistent with the City's Historic Preservation Ordinance ("HPO"), the City was
19 required but failed to refer this Project to the City's Cultural Heritage Committee for review and

.20 recommendation.
70. According to the Ordinance, the Committee's duties include making 21 recommendations to both the Planning Commission and the City Council on "the application of 22 architectural, historic, and cultural preservation standards and guidelines to projects and approvals
$:23 involving historic sites, distriets, and structures" and "alterations related to development or
24 demolition applications involving tisted tesources and propertles-withln-historie preseryution_
25 districts. City Code $14.01.030(B)(5)&(7) The Committee, moreover, "shall review and make

26 recommendations to the Director, Architectural-Review Commission, Planning Commission or

27 City Council on applications and development review projeuts which include-any-ofthe-following

Arrsleden erelad Pascr

Proposed actions of public agencies that may affect historic or cultural resources within the

2 City." City Code $14.01.030(C)(7). (Emphasis added.)
71. Dr. James Papp, Ph.D., the chair of the CHC, specifically requested that the Project
3 be referred to the CHC for consideration, but Staff refused.

72. Staff justified this refusal by invoking the authority of the Community Development
Director ("Director") based on HPO Section 14.01.040, which, according to staff, makes the
Director responsible for interpreting and implementing this ordinance and helping the CHC carry
out its duties. According to Staff, the Director may detennine that CHC review is not required for
actions or projects that do not adversely affect historic resources.
73. The record shows that Staff's decision not to refor the Project to the CHC was based
9 on a so-called "matrix" which according to Staff was developed by Staff and the CHC in order to
10. "Itlo ensure clarity about projects subject to Cultural Heritage Committee review." According to
11 Staff, "[i]n this case, the project is not located in a historic district and there are no historic
12 resources located on the property to be developed. As noted above, the project would not have an

13 adverse effect on historic resources; therefore, the project was not referred to the CHC." A copy of

14 the matrix was never provided to the public and was not included with any of the Staff Reports.
74, Staff's apparent reliance on the matrix was improper and unlawful and amounted to
15 an abuse of discretion because only the Director of Planning is authorized to decide not to refer a
16 project to the CHC. The record shows that in this case, the Director improperly delegated his
17 authority to Staff who solely relied on the matrix to decide not to refer the Project to the CHC.
18 75. Moreover, Staff's reliance on the matrix was improper and unlawful because the

19 matrix is inconsistent with and contradicts the terms of the HPO. According to the matrix, a

20 Project could potentially be referred to the CHC if, and only if, the project is located in a historic

21 district or the property that is being developed itself includes historically significant resources. As
such, any Project that is not located in a designated historic district or is not itself a designated
22 historical resource would not even be considered for referral to the CHC regardless of whether.it
23 may have an indirect impact on historie resources. The matrix, therefore, is inconsistent with the
HIPO requirement that any-projec tthat mwy anect historic or cultural resources within the
25 City" must be referred to the CHC for evaluation. See, City Code $14.01.030(C)(7), -.__

WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents, as set forth herein

2 below.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Declaratory Relief)

5 76. SLAP! refers to and incorporates herein by this reference all preceding

6 paragraphs, inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.
77. SLAP! is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the City has a
7 practice of allowing Planning Staff to decide whether to refer a project to the CHC based on the
8 criteria set forth in the CHC matrix discussed above.
9 78. The City's practice of allowing lower level Planning Staff to decide whether to

10 refer a Project to the CHC in the first instance is in violation of City Code § 14.01.040, which

11 bestows that authority only on the Director of Planning.
79.
12 The Planning Staff's reliance on the afore-mentioned matrix is inconsistent with
and violates the HPO because the use of a matrix to determine whether to refer a project to the
13 CHC is not authorized by the HPO. The matrix, moreover, limits the category of projects that
14 would be referred to the CHC only to those that are located in a historic district or located on a site
15 that itself includes a designated historic resources. The HPO, on the other hand, requires any
16 project that "may affect historie or cultural resources within the City." Accordingly, the range of

17 projects that must be referred to the CHC based on this definition is much broader than the matrix,

18 which excludes any project that, for example, would impact historic resources indirectly (as does
the Project at issue here).
19 80. Accordingly, an actual controversy has arisen and now exists between SLA.PI
20 and the City of San Luis Obispo concerning lawfulness of the City's practice of relying on the
21 CHC matrix and the delegation of authority to Planning Staff.
22 81. A judicial declaration therefore is necessary and appropriate at this time under

23 the circumstances in order to ascertain the rights and responsibilities of the parties.
.24 WHEREFORE, SLAPl prays for judgment against Respondents and each of them as

25 explained below.

ph: 805-593-0926
fax: 805-593-0946 As explained in its appeal documonts, SLAPI contends the City violated CEQA and abused its discretion by concluding the Project is exempt from environmental review.
pobuknelleyésbcglobal.net SLAP! further contends the City violated its own municipal code and abused its discretion, intar alia. because (1) as approved, the Project is inconsistent with the applicable design guidelines and the procedure and provisions in the Conservation and Open Space Element as mandated and explained in the LUCE EIR and (2) the City was required nut failed to refer the Project to the Cultural Heritage Committee (CHC) for evaluation and recommendations. SLAPI also contends the Project does not meet the definition of a "housing development project."
Finally, ploase note that SLAPI also intends to seek a judicial declaration that the Planning Staff's practice of deciding which projects to refer to the CHC based on a so- called *matrix" violates the City's mundcipal ordinance. SLAPI will ask the Court to enjoin the City's reliance on the CHC matrix.
