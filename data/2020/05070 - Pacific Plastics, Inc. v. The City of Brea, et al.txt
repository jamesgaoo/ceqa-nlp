VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Petitioner Pacific Plastics, Inc., for its petition for a writ of mandate and complaint

2 against The City of Brea (the "City"), the City Council of the City of Brea, and DOES 1 through

3 10, inclusive, (collectively, "Respondents"), alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION 4

Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), its 5 1.

6 General Plan, and numerous other laws in approving a large residential project in an industrial

7 area where such projects are not allowed ("the Project"). The Project was proposed and pushed

8 through the City's review process by Real Party in Interest Dwight Manley, a real estate

9 developer known locally as "Mr. Brea" and the "Brea King" due to his political connections and

10 extensive holdings in downtown Brea. In approving the Project without required planning and

11 environmental review, the City has deprived Petitioner Pacific Plastics Inc. and other businesses

12 of protections that they relied on in building their businesses in an industrial area, and placed
JTI HTAVNIA 49006 VD 'SITEONV OOEZ ILINS 'ISVI MIVIAHNINIO 6VOZ VUDO*DCC°ULT 13 public welfare and the environment at risk.
Mr. Manley submitted to the City a development proposal for more than 1,000 14

15 residential units on two parcels on the same industrial street: (a) 114 units located on Berry Street 2.

16 across the street from Petitioner Pacific Plastics (the "Mercury Lane Project"), and (b) 949 units

17 on Berry Street directly next door to Petitioner Pacific Plastics ("The Village"). As shown in the

18 following map provided by the City, the development would be located in the Light Industrial

19 and General Industrial Land Use Designations, within which residential developments are not

20 allowed under the Brea General Plan.1

11 OOEZ BLINS 'ISVI MAVA ANNINIO 6VOZ 12 3. The City initially set out to evaluate this proposal as the law requires. The City dTT ATAVNIA 49006
8 13 insisted on a "Central City Core" planning process, which would include amending the General
3139NV 14 Plan and adopting one or more Specific Plans allowing residential uses in the arca. Additionally,

15 the a City called for a commensurately broad scope of CEQA review, which would consider the

16 environmental consequences of the proposed General Plan Amendment and the residential

17 development it would enable, including Mr. Manley's over 1,000-unit proposal. But the
timetable required to amend the General Plan, provide a full public process, and properly
evaluate the environmental and public welfare risks of allowing large residential uses in an area 18

19

20 with an Industrial Land Use Designation was unacceptable to Mr. Manley. Accordingly, he

21 pushed the City to expedite approval by bypassing the General Plan amendment process and

22 segmenting his development of the Mercury Lane and The Village sites.

23 4. The City agreed to Manley's request. The City proceeded to bypass the general

24 plan amendment process required to permit residential in an area with the Light Industrial Land

25 Use Designation. The City also artificially narrowed its CEQA review to consider only the 114-

26 unit Mercury Lane Project, ignoring that Mr. Manley's larger development also includes the 949-

27 unit Village across the street. Further undermining the public's ability to understand and

28 meaningfully inform review, the City held a series of "Study Sessions" without providing

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P required public notice. At these sessions, Mr. Manley was provided a platform to advocate for

2 his project to the City without any concerned citizens being heard.

3 5. The City's final approval of the Mercury Lane Project reflects the unlawful scope

4 of its review. The City arbitrarily and capriciously found that the General Plan allows for

5 amendment of the Plan's Industrial Land Use Designation without going through the required

6 General Plan Amendment process. The City also certified an Environmental Impact Report

7 ("EIR") for the Mercury Lane Project that does not mention The Village across the street, either

8 as part of Mr. Manley's proposed project or as a future action that will cause cumulative impacts

9 that will compound the harms to City's industrial base, public health, and the environment.

6. The erosion of Brea's industrial base without required planning and 10

11 environmental review continues. Since the City approved the Mercury Lane Project, 006Z ILINS 'ISVI MAVA AXAINIO 6F0Z 12 development of a third large parcel on this same block has been proposed. This third
JIT IT8VNIA 49006 VO 'SITIONY S 13 development could bring nearly one thousand more residential units,2 on top of the 1,063 units

14 proposed by Mr. Manley, to this same industrial block, mere feet away from Petitioner'

15 industrial business.

16 7. The Mercury Lane Project was intended from the start as part of a larger

17 residential redevelopment of an area the General Plan designates for Industrial Land Use. But

18 before the City may allow this redevelopment, it must amend the Brea General Plan, provide for

19 required public involvement, and fully evaluate the adverse impacts on both businesses operating

20 within the area and residents who would live next door to industrial operations.

21 8. The City has approved Mr. Brea's large-scale residential incursion into Brea's

22 Industrial Land Use area without complying with the Brea General Plan, CEQA, the Ralph M.

23 Brown Act, the Brea Municipal Code, or basic principles of municipal governance. Petitioner, its
24 over 100 employees, other industrial businesses, and the residents that the City would place next

25

27 The third development is equivalent in size to the parcel on which The Village would be 28 situated. Assuming similar massing is permitted for a residential development on this site, roughly an additional 949 units could be built if permitted.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 1

2 A. Pacific Plastics' Longstanding History in Brea

u 19. Pacific Plastics is a 41-year old advanced manufacturing company that produces
4 PVC pipe.
n 20. Petitioner established its business in 1979 and relocated to the City of Brea over
6 Pacific Plastics' manufacturing plant is located at 111-221 South Berry Street and 23 years ago.
7 consists of 95,000 square 8 feet of structures on 8 acres of land. The plant is serviced by an active

8 rail spur. Pacific Plastics is determined to remain at its present location in the City of Brea for

9 many decades to come.

10 21. The total production capacity at Pacific Plastics' plant currently is approximately

11 49006 DoCE ELOSS, SNA SATVS AYALAED GNOC 'SITIONV SOI 340,000 pounds of PVC Pipe per day. PVC pipe must conform to ASTM standards, but the

12 quality of Pacific Plastics pipe exceeds these standards and has earned a strong reputation and a JIT ATAVNIA UUDD-OGGTULS 13 very high position in the market. The pipes are used in agriculture, irrigation, plumbing,

14 landscaping, and as electrical conduits. Pacific Plastics takes pride in producing millions of feet

15 of pipe every month and the fact that its pipes have never failed during the business's 40+ year

16 history.

17 22. Pacific Plastics also prides itself on being a job-provider and good corporate

18 industrial citizen of the City of Brea. Pacific Plastics currently employs approximately 110 full-

19 time workers. Planned expansion will add at least 10 more jobs. Pacific Plastics is in the

20 process of adding equipment that will increase its capacity by at least 40%. The increases in

21 production capacity will be accompanied by an expansion of the facility's footprint before the

22 end of 2020.

23 23. Pacific Plastics operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year. The

24 production equipment can be operated efficiently and economically only if the equipment is

25 operated continuously. A reduction in these work hours would make the business uncompetitive

26 and likely cause it to fail, eliminating at least 120 jobs.

27 24. Recent and planned expansions of the manufacturing plant will cause truck traffic

28 to increase from 30 truck visits per day to 65 per day. The plant is large enough to handle most

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

2 of these truck visits on Pacific Plastics' properties, but tractor-trailers often need to queue for

3 access by parking in parking spaces on the street with their engines turned off. Street parking

4 availability is limited but, because this area is designated Light Industrial and General Industrial

5 by the General Plan, the available parking has been sufficient for truck staging to date. If the

6 street parking becomes less available, these trucks will not be able to park, forcing them to idle

7 their engines or circle the neighborhood, and thus exacerbating air quality, traffic, and

environmental conditions.

8 B.

o The Area Designated for Industrial Land Use Where Pacific Plastics and Mr.

Manley's Residential Projects Would Be Located

10 25.

11 The proposed Mercury Lane Project would be located in a Light Industrial Land

12 Use Designation, surrounded by properties carrying a General Industrial Land Use Designation.

VENABLE LLP £9006 120, VyA SHVD AY SORE SH1EONV SOT The three parcels immediately adjacent to the Mercury Lane Project (including both The Village

UUDO"CL6ULE 13

14 and Pacific Plastics) have a General Industrial Land Use Designation. The Brea General Plan

15 decrees that areas with a Land Use Designation of General Industrial must be located far enough

16 away from residential uses that "possible hazards, noise, and other disturbances" will not impact

2049 residential neighborhoods and similar uses. (Brea General Plan at 2-15).

17 26.

18 Pacific Plastics has invested tens of millions of dollars into its manufacturing site

19 in reliance on the City's industrial zoning and its General Plan policies and guidelines. Pacific

20 Plastics has also relied on the fact that the Brea General Plan prohibits nearby residential uses,

21 and on the fact that the Industrial Land Use Designation includes streets that are intended,

22 designed, and constructed for industrial operations and traffic. An example of that is the jumbo

23 cul-de-sac at the end of Mercury Lane (within ten meters of the Mercury Lane Project), which is
designed to allow very large tractor-trailers to conveniently turn around.

24 C. Dwight Manley's History in Brea

25 27.

26 28. Mr. Manley owns 20 office buildings, restaurants, and other buildings in Brea.

27 Manley has a history and reputation in Brea for political stunts designed to push

28 his agenda forward. For example, just last year, Manley arranged for the Reverend Jesse Jackson
to appear before the Brea City Council as part of his opposition to the City's proposed

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

acquisition of the Birch Hills Golf Course. (See, e.g., G. San Roman, "Is Dwight Manley Brea's

2 Native Son Savior Or Its Mad Monarch?" OC WEEKLY (Nov. 27, 2019), available at

3 https://www.ocweekly.com/is-dwight-manley-breas-native-son-savior-or-its-mad-monarch/).

4 29. Manley was raised in the City and has spent much of his career developing

5 properties throughout the City, with a particular focus on the downtown Brea area. (ld.). As

6 Manley explained, "One by one, I started buying all the pieces on the Monopoly board" (Id.).

7 30. In the past five years, Manley has used his wealth and highly visible real estate to

8 influence political outcomes in Brea. For example, Manley worked to secure public financing of

9 a $13 million parking structure in downtown Brea. Manley targeted then Mayor Brett Murdock,

10 calling him "dishonest" and "bad" for Brea for opposing public financing of the parking structure

11 and proposing that local business owners contribute to its construction costs. (Id.). Manley

12 29006 VO '$3729NV S01 2300 dLINS 'ISVa MMVd AXOLNa: 6POZ contributed $25,000 to ensure a clean sweep of the City Council, in addition to hanging huge LLP 318VNIA 13 anti-Murdock banners from his properties. (Id.). In September 2015, following Murdock's loss of
OD'OLL'ULE 14 a reelection bid, the Brea City Council approved spending up to $10.3 million on the parking

15 structure, using a mix of 2011 bond and community benefit and economic development funds,

16 and almost $3 million from the general fund. (Id.).

17 31. In another example, Manley opposed Measure K, a $148 million school bond

18 effort aiming to repair and better fund Brea classrooms. Manley hung a huge banner from his

19 downtown office and recruited Dennis Rodman to hold signs opposing the school bond. As a

20 result of a lawsuit, he was forced to remove a "false and misleading" quote attributed to former

21 California State Treasurer John Chiang from the Argument Against measure K, which would

22 otherwise have appeared on official voter guides and sample ballots. (Id.).

23 32. Mr. Manley's property ownership, financial resources, and open efforts to remove

24 any public official who does not vote according to his agenda has created a culture in Brea of

25 deference to Manley, his projects, and his political desires. Indeed, a former Brea planning

26 commissioner and former Brea Chamber of Commerce chairman stated that "City Council is

27 beholden to him, while at the same time afraid of him ... That fear permeates the entire

28 bureaucracy." (Id.). This is the climate in which Manley's Mercury Lane Project was introduced.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

M D. The Brea General Plan

2 33. California law requires each city to adopt a general plan to govern future

Lesher 3 development within its jurisdiction. (Government Code § 65350; see also, e.g.,

4 Comme'ns, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 531, 540 [explaining that a general

5 plan serves as a "'constitution' for future development"]). A general plan may be amended up to

6 four times per year. (Government Code § 65358(b)).

7 34. The City adopted the Brea General Plan and certified an associated Final

8 Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") on August 19, 2003.

9 35. The Brea General Plan is intended to "ensure that the City maintains a balance

10 among residential, commercial, and industrial land uses." (Brea General Plan Policy CD 1.4, at

AVa AXNINIO 6HOZ EAST, SUITE 2300 11 2-25). The Plan lays out a vision of Brea that "identifies the form of Brea in two dimensions . . .

12 traditional land use patterns of residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial LLP VENABLE 29006 VO 'SETIONV S01 210.720-0000 13 districts..." (Brea General Plan at 2-3; see also Land Use Policy Map at 2-9).

14 36. The Brea General Plan recognizes that the City's "[e]conomic stronghold stems

15 from its employment diversity of office, retail, manufacturing, and industrial businesses.

16 Retaining and expanding these businesses will continue the economic benefits the City

17 maintains, as well as those seeking employment opportunities in Brea." (Brea General Plan at 2-
18 125). To this end, the General Plan provides "for increases in office, industrial, and commercial

19 uses 23 (Id. at 2-120). Recognizing a shortage of industrial buildings, the Plan provides "for at

20 least a 10 percent increase in industrial space square footage over the time horizon of the General

21 Plan." (Id. at 2-123).

22 37. Among the Land Use Designations adopted within the Brea General Plan are

23 specific Land Use Designations for Light Industrial uses and General Industrial uses. The Brea

24 General Plan imposes requirements and limitations for development within these zones. (See id.

25 at 2-15).

26 38. The Brea General Plan establishes a Light Industrial Designation with a

27 maximum Floor Area Ratio ("FAR") of 0.75 for the purpose of accommodating "industrial uses

28 that are low intensity and contained entirely within buildings." (Brea General Plan at 2-15).

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P 39. The Brea General Plan also a establishes a General Industrial Designation with a

2 maximum FAR of 0.75 for "larger-scale, heavier industrial activities in areas where possible

3 hazards, noise, and other disturbances will not impact residential neighborhoods, schools, and

4

40 40. The Brea General Plan references a concept of "Planned Community Zones" ("PC similar uses." (Id.).

6 Zones"), which purportedly function much like Specific Plans. After a 2018 General Plan

7 Amendment, the General Plan states that a PC Zone "provides a similarly flexible tool through

8 the approval of Planned Community Master Plans. The City will continue to use these adopted

9 plans to guide development within the various Specific Plan Boundaries."

10 E. Mr. Manley's Proposed Residential Development of the Mercury Lane

Industrial Area 11 DOET ALINS 'ISVA MAVA AXNINIO 6YOZ 12 41. In May of 2017, Mr. Manley proposed residential development within Brea's LLP VENABLE VUDD-DGE-UIT 49006 CA $3135NV SOT 13 industrial zone to the then-Community Development Director David M. Crabtree. (See

14 Community Development Director David M. Crabtree, letter to Dwight Manley, May 30, 2017).

15 42. Mr. Manley proposed the development of 1,063 residential units within the Light

16 Industrial and General Industrial Land Use Designations, including the 114-unit Mercury Lane

17 site and the 949-unit The Village across Berry Strect. (Id.). Additionally, Manley proposed a

18 third residential project nearby and abutting the Imperial Highway. (Id.).

19 43. The City embarked upon "a process of pro-active, future planning, within the

20 central portion of Brea the Central City Core (CCC) planning process." (Id.). The City

21 "identified this process as the most efficient way for [Mr. Manley] to work to advance the three

22 mentioned projects-both for processing costs as well as timing. Specifically, the CCC effort is

23 envisioned to result in Specific Plan(s) for the area with an ability to consider pending private

24 development projects within this comprehensive planning effort." (Id.)

25 44. The City requested a Specific Site Analysis and explained that the approval

26 process would require submission of over a dozen documents describing the Mercury Lane

27 Project and The Village in very specific detail. The City viewed this list of documents as a first

28 step in a large development process, including a General Plan Amendment and comprehensive

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

CEQA review. The City explained that "the result of this work program is not to realize

2 *construction documents,' but is anticipated to realize concept plans which can fit within the

3 envisioned Specific Plan and associated CEQA analysis to follow this first phase." (Id.). The

4 City suggested that it could review the projects independently, but warned that "[s]uch process

5 would forego a more comprehensive approach acknowledging 'bigger picture' planning for the

6 area and associated benefits to your individual projects, as well as foregoing a more efficient and

7 anticipated cost and time savings to the necessary CEQA review.* (Id.).

8 45. Mr. Manley rejected the City's proposed scope of planning and environmental

9 review--including the adoption of a Central City Core Specific Plan, a General Plan

10 Amendment, and comprehensive EIR addressing the proposed residential developments.

11 Instead, he sought to expedite review and limit environmental review and public participation by

12 segment his proposed residential development into smaller projects.
LLP TIAVNIA 46. UUDb"DCG-ULS 29006 VO 'SIEONV SOT OOÉZ ELINS 'ISVA MUVA ANOINIO 6YOZ 13 The City posted a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report
14 ("DEIR") on December 13, 2018. On July 24, 2019, the City issued a Notice of Availability of

15 the DEIR. Consistent with Mr. Manley's efforts to cut corners and minimize the scale and

16 impacts of his proposal, the DEIR analyzed only the development of the Mercury Lane Project

17 and its 114 residential units, ignoring The Village and its proposed 949 residential units. The

18 review period for the DEIR ended on September 6, 2019.

19 47. After releasing the DEIR, beginning on August 27, 2019, the Brea Planning

20 Commission held a series of "Study Sessions" that addressed the Mercury Lane Project, even

21 though scoping and a DEIR had already been completed. The Study Sessions went well beyond

22 informational presentations. During the sessions, Mr. Manley and the Planning Commissioners

23 had detailed discussions regarding specific project elements, including changes to the Project

24 that would facilitate approval by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission held five

25 such Study Sessions in five consecutive months, on August 27, 2019; September 24, 2019;

26 October 22, 2019; November 26, 2019; and December 10, 2019.

27 48. On information and belief, the City held these Study Sessions without first

28 mailing notices to adjacent property owners. Instead, the City only posted the agendas and

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 published them in a newspaper of general circulation. Further, two of the five agendas did not
N m $0 0N even mention the project. The three that did only listed a "Mercury Residential Project
Overview," without stating the project's location. The description "Mercury Residential Project
Overview" was plainly insufficient to provide notice to Petitioner or other members of the public
that a residential project was being proposed on Mercury Lane.

49. In October of 2019, after the comment period for the DEIR had closed, Mr.
Manley sent flyer describing the project to Petitioner and called Petitioner to make them aware,

8 for the first time, that Mr. Manley had proposed building a large apartment building mere feet

9 from their industrial operations.

10 50. In sum, despite being located directly across the street from the Mercury Lane

11 Project site and immediately next to The Village site, Pacific Plastics did not receive notice

12 regarding the Notice of Preparation; Notice of Availability of the DEIR; August 27 Study dTT HTAVNIA 310.774-0000 49006 VD 'S373ONV S01 O0EZ ILINS 'ISVI MAVIAMNINIS 6707 13 Session; September 24 Study Session; October 22 Study Session; November 26 Study Session;

14 or December 10 Study Session. In fact, the first and only notice received by Pacific Plastics

15 regarding the Mercury Lane Project was the mailed notice of the Planning Commission meeting

16 to be held on January 28, 2020. By that time, Mr. Manley had lobbied the Planning Commission

17 for five Study Sessions, the DEIR comment period had closed, and the City had already prepared

18 a draft FEIR.

19 51. The Brea Zoning Code requires an outreach plan for any application for PC

20 Zones. The BMC required the City and Mr. Manley to hold a "Project overview" to provide

21 adjacent property owners "an opportunity to learn about the project as well as provide their

22 feedback." (See Master Plan, p. A-1). The City should have held the "Project overview" in the

23 second quarter of 2019. However, the Project overview never occurred. Indeed, as discussed

24 above, Pacific Plastics was not contacted by the applicant until more than a month after the

25 comment period on the DEIR had closed. Even then, Mr. Manley only emailed a brochure on the

26 proposed Project and called Petitioner once. Mr. Manley did not meet or seek to meet with

27 Petitioner before the January 28, 2020 Planning Commission hearing.

1 52. The lack of public notice undermined the CEQA process and public review of the

2 Project. The DEIR stated that "there are no specific areas of known controversy concerning the

3 proposed project" and that the City "has no knowledge of expressed opposition to the project."

4 (See DEIR at 1-15). In fact, Petitioner opposed Mr. Manley's proposed development of both the

5 Mercury Lane and The Village sites. However, the City and Mr. Manley deprived Petitioner of

6 the opportunity to participate in nearly a year of discussion and review by the City.

7 53. On January 26, 2020, Petitioner Pacific Plastics submitted a letter to the Planning

8 Commission opposing the Project. Pacific Plastics raised numerous concerns with the Project,

9 including inconsistency with the General Plan, myriad issues with CEQA compliance, violations

10 of the BMC, and the lack of public notice regarding the numerous "Study Sessions."

11 54. At the January 28, 2020 hearing, the Planning Commission considered approving
49006 BLIOSE SVa 12 the Project in a fully public setting for the first time. This was the first meeting addressing the
VENABLE LLP 13

'SATIONV S01 XAVA AXNINRD 6POZ UUOD-OCG-UL Project following mailed notice of the Project to Petitioner Pacific Plastics. This time, numerous

14 speakers, including Pacific Plastics, attended and spoke in opposition to the Project. The item

15 was then continued to February 25, 2020. (Id.). At that meeting, due to the amount of testimony

16 the Commissioners received, the Planning Commission opted to continue the item to the next

17 regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting, to be held on March 24, 2020.

18 55. The Planning Commission did not meet on March 24, 2020, and did not issue

19 another continuance. Instead, the Planning Commission held another hearing on the Project on

20 April 28, 2020, without first providing new notice of the further continuance, as the Brea

21 Municipal Code ("BMC") required. (BMC § 20.416.030(B) ["[A]ny hearing on a zoning matter

22 may be continued from time to time and place to place, provided the time and place to which

23 continued is announced prior to the adjournment of the meeting from which continued."

25 56. At the April 28, 2020 Planning Commission hearing, the majority of the

26 Commission agreed that the Project required additional parking and recommended a 1.35

27 parking space per unit ratio. The Commission ultimately determined that Mr. Manley should

28 provide 118 spaces onsite, but would allow additional spaces to be provided in the West Parking

1 Garage. The Commission then unanimously voted to approve the Zone Change, Planned

2 Community Master Plan, Development Agreement, and FEIR for the Mercury Lane Project.

3 57. The City Council then considered the Project at a May 12, 2020 hearing. Pacific

4 Plastics spoke at the hearing, and submitted a letter to the City Council outlining problems with

5 the Project and the review process. Among other concerns, Petitioner spoke about interior noise

6 level limits, explaining that the maximum allowable interior noise level is 45 dba in a residential

7 setting, but that noise levels are far higher in an industrial zone.

8 58. Community Development Director Steinkruger spoke about parking impacts,

9 indicating that the applicant proposed 118 parking spaces, but that a parking analysis and peer

10 review indicated that between 178 and 213 parking spaces should be required. Steinkruger also

11 stated that the BMC would require 202 parking spaces. The City Council then voted

90067 VO 'SEIIONV S01 DOEZ ALINS 'ISVA NAVA XXAINIO 5YOZ 12 unanimously to continue the public hearing to May 19, 2020. LLP ATAVNIA 210.220_0000 13 59. At the City Council hearing on May 19, 2020, Pacific Plastics spoke again in

14 opposition to the Mercury Lane Project. Petitioner explained that the City provided changes to

15 the Conditions of Approval and Development Agreement only moments before the meeting

16 began, which did not allow the public time to review. The City Council then closed the public

17 hearing and continued the item to a May 21 Special Meeting.

18 60. At the Special Meeting on May 21, 2020, Community Development Director

19 Steinkruger provided an update, including affirming that only 118 spaces would be made

20 available onsite notwithstanding her previous statements that more were required. The City

21 Council then voted unanimously to adopt the FEIR, a Development Agreement for the Project,

22 and a PC Zone allowing residential development in the industrial zone. Notwithstanding

23 comments raised by Petitioner and others, the FEIR failed to evaluate or even mention The

24 Village or address numerous other foreseeable impacts of the Project.

4 § (Government Code § 65350), which serves as a "constitution' for future development..."

6 64. Respondents have a clear, mandatory duty to amend the general plan pursuant to

7 the requirements of Government Code §§ 65350, 65358, and 65359.

8 65. The Brea General Plan is built on the vision of "a local economy that provides a

9 sufficient base of revenue, employment options, and ample commercial, financial, office and

10 industrial opportunities." (Brea General Plan at 2-1). The General Plan also "identifies the form

11 of Brea in two dimensions traditional land use patterns of residential neighborhoods and

14 66. The Brea General Plan establishes a Light Industrial zone with a maximum Floor

15 Area Ratio ("FAR") of 0.75 for the purpose of accommodating "industrial uses that are low

16 intensity and contained entirely within buildings." (Brea General Plan at 2-15).

17 67. The Brea General Plan establishes a General Industrial zone with a maximum

18 FAR of 0.75 for the purpose of "larger-scale, heavier industrial activities in areas where possible

19 hazards, noise, and other disturbances will not impact residential neighborhoods, schools, and

20 similar uses." (Id. [emphasis added])

21 68. The Brea General Plan establishes goals and policies to guide future development.

22 Among these goals is to "provide a balance of land uses to meet the present and future needs of

23 all residents." (Brea General Plan Goal CD-1 at 2-25). In furtherance of this goal, the Brea

24 General Plan also establishes a policy to "ensure that the City maintains a balance among a

25 residential, commercial, and industrial land uses." (Brea General Plan Policy CD 1.4, at 2-25).

26 69. The Brea General Plan affirms that "[I]and use policy accommodates new growth

4 at least a 10 percent increase in industrial space square footage over the time horizon of the

6 71. The Brea General Plan recognizes that part of the City's "[e]conomic stronghold

7 stems from its employment diversity of office, retail, manufacturing, and industrial businesses.

8 Retaining and expanding these businesses will continue the economic benefits the City

9 maintains, as well as those seeking employment opportunities in Brea." (Id. at 2-125).
10 72. Contrary to the General Plan's vision of Brea as providing the traditional land use

11 patterns of residential neighborhoods separated from commercial and industrial districts, the

12 Mercury Lane Project would situate a residential development within the Light Industrial Land dUT NTEVNI 410-929-9900 29006 VO 'SZIADNV S0T OOEZ ELINS 'ISVA MAVA AXNINHO 6VOZ 13 Use Designation, and would place its residents mere feet away from the General Industrial Land

14 Use Designation, which allows for heavier industrial uses and is intended to be separated from is

15 residential uses.

16 73. The Brea General Plan establishes a maximum FAR of 0.75 in the Light Industrial

17 Land Use Designation, yet the Mercury Lane Project was approved with a FAR of 2.06, well in

18 excess of what the Brea General Plan permits for its location.

19 74. The Brea General Plan establishes a maximum FAR of 0.75 in the General

20 Industrial Land Use Designation, yet The Village proposes a FAR well in excess of this

21 maximum.

22 75. The Mercury Lane Project will disrupt the balance of land uses mandated by the

23 Brea General Plan by comingling residential and industrial uses, to the detriment of existing

24 businesses and future residents of the Mercury Lane Project.
25 76. The Brea General Plan provides for an increase in industrial uses, yet the Mercury

26 Lane Project would place residential uses in a Light Industrial Land Use Designation, decreasing

27 available industrial spacc within the City and creating land use conflicts likely to further reduce

3 Lane Project would result in a decrease in industrial space in one of the City's key industrial

4 zones.

5 78. In approving the Mercury Lane Project, Respondents have unlawfully failed

6 and/or refused to perform their duty to adopt and maintain a General Plan and to amend the Plan

7 as the law required before authorizing land uses that conflict with Plan. Respondents unlawfully

8 approved the Mercury Lane Project despite its inconsistency with the General Plan without

9 amending the General Plan and completing the associated public hearing and environmental

10 review process. Unless the Court requires Respondents to set aside its approval of the Project and

11 to comply with the Brea General Plan, Respondents will continue to fail to perform the duties

12 that are required by law.

15 law, other than the relief sought herein.

16 81. The issuance of a writ of mandate, as sought by Petitioner, will result in the

17 enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, and will confer a significant

18 benefit on the general public, specifically in the Brea Downtown Core, as it will require

19 compliance with California laws that were enacted to govern land use planning and to ensure

20 proper zoning and environmental review prior to development.
21 82. The City of Brea's failure and/or refusal to mandate a General Plan Amendment,

22 or to require the Mercury Lane Project to operate consistently with the Brea General Plan

23 violates mandatory duties imposed on Respondents and/or constitutes action that is contrary to

24 law, an abuse of discretion, and/or arbitrary and capricious.

25 83. Therefore, a writ of mandate should issue directing Respondents to (i) rescind all

26 approvals for the Mercury Lane Project and (ii) require any proposed development of the site to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

The land use designations establish basic guidelines for property development: L permitted uses and maximum permitted development densities. Further
2 requirements are spelled out in the City's zoning ordinance, the primary tool used to implement land use policy. Specific Plans represent a second tool; Specific
UJ Plans provide a detailed plan for development within a particular area that may or may not reflect standard zoning ordinance requirements. The Planned Community 4 (PC) zone provides a similarly flexible tool through the approval of Planned
n Community Master Plans. The City will continue to use these adopted plans to guide development of properties within the various Specific Plan boundaries. As a
6 general practice, however, the City will discourage further use of Specific Plans unless circumstances indicate that a Specific Plan represents the best method of

The 7 achieving a cobesive land use plan for a property or related properties. The Planned Community (PC) Zone is also available for similar purposes 8 Land Use Policy Map provides general guidance regarding the type and

10 Ordinance, and any applicable Planned Community Master Plan to determine the extent to which a property may be developed and/or used .. 11 90. Nothing in the 2018 Amendment or elsewhere in the General Plan exempts PC
12
LLP NIAVNIA C9006 00SZ ILINS 'ISVI MAVIAXNINIO 6POZ Zoning from the requirement of consistency with the General Plan. Indeed, the 2018 Amendment
8 13
'SHT39NY! JUDD"OGO*U LT states that PC Zoning is "similar" to a Specific Plan. Under the law, any proposed Specific Plan
14 that is inconsistent with the General Plan must be accompanied by a General Plan Amendment.
15 Here, Respondents sought to avoid the General Plan Amendment process by using a PC Zone,
16 effectively, as a form of unlawful "spot general planning."
17 91. The City violated California Government Code §§ 65350, 65358, and 65359 by
18 approving an inconsistent use without amending the General Plan. As explained above, the
19 Project is inconsistent with the General Plan for several reasons. For example, the Project is
20 inconsistent with the Brea General Plan's maximum FAR of 0.75 within the Light Industrial
21 Land Use Designation and requirement that General Industrial parcels shall be located far from
22 residential uses. The Mercury Lane Project has a FAR of 2.06 and is located next to industrial
23
uses.
24 92. Respondents' apparent reliance on PC zoning is circular, unreasonable, and
25 inconsistent with California law and the General Plan. Respondents contend that PC Zones do
26 not need to be consistent with the Brea General Plan because the Brea General Plan allows for
27 PC Zones to be inconsistent. But nothing in the General Plan allows for PC Zones to contradict
28 the Brea General Plan or allows Respondents to amend the General Plan without providing

1 required process. To amend the General Plan, the City must publicly notice a proposed General

2 Plan Amendment, hold public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council

3 discussing that proposed General Plan Amendment and its impacts on future development in the

4 City, and complete comprehensive CEQA review process, including an EIR analyzing the

5 environmental impacts of the proposed amendment. The City did not do each of these in

6 approving the Project and PC Zone. Instead, the City adopted a PC Zone Change ordinance and

7 certified an EIR analyzing only the Mercury Lane Project.

8 93. California law limits amendments to a city's general plan, providing that "no

9 mandatory element of a general plan shall be amended more frequently than four times during

10 any calendar year." (Government Code § 65358(b)). PC Zoning would allow the City to enact

11 four General Plan Amendments per year plus an unlimited number of effective amendments

12 through the PC Zoning process.
VENABLE LLP LOS ANGELES, CA 49006 2300 ALIOS 'ISVZX Vd AXNINIO 6OZ UUDO"066™U% 13 94. Respondents' use of PC Zoning unlawfully permitted development that is

15 General Plan Amendment process and its attendant public hearings and environmental review.
16 (See Government Code §§ 65350, 65358, 65359).

17 95. Even assuming that "PC Zoning" can be used to amend the Brea General Plan

18 without going through the Plan amendment process, the City did not justify use of a PC Zone.

19 The City's Zoning Code states that the Planned Community Zone shall be reserved for the

20 development of innovative projects in areas of the city that present unique planning challenges

21 due to considerations such as geography, topography, and changing patterns of development not

22 otherwise addressed by the City's existing zoning rules. (See BMC § 20.272.010(B); see also
23 BMC § 20.272.030(G)(6)). Petitioners have failed to explain how the industrial area of the City

24 at issue represents a unique planning challenge that cannot be addressed by the City's existing

25 zoning rules, including a General Plan amendment.

26 96. The City cannot approve a Planned Community Master Plan unless it finds the

27 proposed uses are suitable in terms of their relationship to adjacent properties. (See BMC §
28 20.272.030(G)(6)(d)). The proposed Planned Community Master Plan would exclusively allow

P residential uses (and uses accessory to residential uses) in the middle of a heavily industrialized

2 area of the City. The City has not explained why the Mercury Lane Project site is suitable for

3 residential development in terms of its relationship to adjacent properties. In fact, the Brea

4 General Plan specifically provides for a separation between residential and industrial uses. The

5 General Industrial Land Use Designation (which includes parcels directly across the street from

6 the Mercury Lane Project) is required to be situated where "possible hazards, noise, and other

7 disturbances will not impact residential neighborhoods, schools, and similar uses." (Brea General

6 103. Respondents have a clear, mandatory duty to comply with the Public Resources

10 conditions in the vicinity of the project" viewed from a "local and regional perspective." (14

OOEZ ALINS 'ISVA NUVA ANOINED 6FOZ 11 CCR § 15125(a),(c)). These existing conditions "will normally constitute the baseline physical

14 comprehensive to allow a project's significant impacts "to be considered in the full

15 environmental context." (Id. at § 15125(c)).

16 105. It is well established that an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the

17 sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (Washoe Meadows Cmty. V. Dep of

18 Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal. App. 5th 277, 287 (citation omitted); see also Laurel Heights

19 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. App. 3d 376). "Only through an

20 accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the

21 proposal's benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the

22 advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e., the 'no project' alternative), and weigh other

23 alternatives in the balance." (Cnty. Of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185,

107. CEQA prohibits "piecemeal" review of a project in order to minimize or avoid T

2 environmental review. (See Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. v. Board of Port Com'rs

3 (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1358). A lead agency cannot allow "environmental considerations

4 [to] become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones each with a minimal

5 potential impact on the environment which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences."

OD"OGG-ULE 14 (People ex rel Younger v. Local Agency Formation Commission (1978) 81 Cal. App .3d 464,

15 479). The California Supreme Court has stated that "an EIR must include an analysis of the

16 environmental effects of future expansion or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably foreseeable

17 consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in

18 it that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects."

19 (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of California (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 376,

20 396).

108. An EIR must examine a "proposed project['s] ... potential to degrade the quality 21

22 of the environment, curtail the range of the environment, or to achieve short-term, to the

23 disadvantage of long-term, environmental goals," including circumstances where a project's
are individually limited but cumulatively considerable." (CEQA Guidelines 24

26 "cumulatively considerable" as the "incremental effects of an individual project ... when viewed

12 110. The FEIR's description of baseline conditions violated CEQA and the CEQA
JTAVNIA LLP UUDO-DGC-UIE 29005 VO 'SITIONV SOT COSZ ALINS 'ISVA MAVIAANINIS 6YOZ 13 guidelines by making numerous misstatements and omissions regarding conditions in the

14 surrounding industrial neighborhood that undermine the consideration of effects. (See 14 CCR §

15 15125(a),(c).)

16 111. The FEIR inaccurately describes Pacific Plastics' operations. Pacific Plastics

17 operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. There is steady heavy truck and

18 employee traffic and consistent, loud noise from compressors, grinders, backup alarms, and other

19 manufacturing equipment and operations expected in an industrial zone. The FEIR does not

20 mention these existing noise impacts.
5 8 112. While the FEIR mentions noise from truck traffic, it significantly understates
truck traffic on Berry Street and Mercury Lane around the proposed project. The FEIR appears to
23 state that land uses "directly abutting the project site" do not generate more than 100 trucks per

24 day, a threshold indicating "the potential to elevate health risks" and requiring a Health Risk

25 Assessment, per the California Air Resources Board's Air Quality Land Use Handbook. (DEIR

26 at 5.5-8 & n.1). To the extent this statement is meant to indicate that neighboring properties

27 generate fewer than 100 trucks per day, the statement is wrong. Petitioner, just by itself,

28 currently averages over 30 truck trips per day and, with expanded capacity that is soon to come

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

r online, expects over 65 truck trips per day in the near future. This does not account for the truck

2 trips generated by SPX Cooling Technologies or other immediately adjacent industrial

3 neighbors. In addition, the City failed to count the truck trips on Berry Street and Mercury Lane

4 that are not associated with other industrial business next to but not immediately abutting the

5 Project site. Accordingly, the City has significantly understated truck traffic.

6 113. The FEIR similarly misstates that rail "freight delivery to [Pacific Plastics] is

7 infrequent," at just one train per week. (DEIR at 5.5-6). Contrary to these statements, Pacific

8 Plastics receives rail deliveries at least twice per week, with each rail delivery consisting of 10

9

10 The FEIR's misstatement of truck and freight trips around the project renders the fully-loaded freight cars.

114.

11 FEIR's description of traffic, noise, and air quality conditions surrounding the project inaccurate,

12 and thus skews assessment of the project's traffic, noise, and air quality effects.
JTT ITAVNIA 115. Not only does the FEIR start from an inaccurate baseline in considering traffic, UU0O-DGC- 49006 ODEZ ALIOBE LSUA SHTO AY LAJBO SSOE 'SATHONV! 13

14 noise and air quality conditions, but the FEIR also fails to consider the effects of the proposed

15 project's contribution to these conditions on future residents and existing users of the industrial

16 zone.

17 116. The FEIR also mischaracterizes the larger context of the industrial area in which
18 Pacific Plastics is located and the Mercury Lane Project is proposed. The FEIR does not mention

19 that South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) maps show that there are
numerous permitted stationary sources within a mile of the proposed project. (See https://www.
21 arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=27869c8318834329bbf675b59c8fff63[last 20

22 visited Sept. 1, 2020]).

23 117. The FEIR incorrectly states that the proposed project would not be disconnected

24 from other residential communities or "divide the industrial community" because it is on the

25 "eastern edge of the industrial area." (DEIR at 5.5-7, 5.5-9). However, the Mercury Lane Project

26 would be surrounded by industrial sources, and further cut off from residential communities by

27 Imperial Highway, a high-traffic highway located less than 600 feet away from the proposed

28 project.

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

T B. Inadequate Project Description

2 118. The FEIR's project description is inadequate because it frames the proposed

3 project narrowly as the Mercury Lane proposal, obscuring the broader action and associated

4 effects of the PC Zone change and Mr. Manley's proposed residential development immediately

5 across the street, The Village. Respondents did not assess the "whole of the project" or base its

6 FEIR on an accurate, stable, and finite project description, as required by CEQA.

7 119. The City acknowledges that the "PC Zone" it approved may provide for

8 additional residential development in the surrounding area. For example, the DEIR states that

9 "[p]roposals may arise to implement the PC Zone in the vicinity of the project." (DEIR at 10-2).

10 And the FEIR appears to confirm that the PC Zone could provide for "additional development in

11 2300 the industrial area." (FEIR at 2-63). These statements show that the proposed PC Zone will pave

12 the way for additional residential development in the "vicinity of the project." As such, the DEIR
VENABLE LLP 49006 LL2906, W SHTAAYOLOEEO (VOE ITHONV SOT UUD0-OCC-U LI 13 must frame the proposed action as the Mercury Lane proposal plus the PC Zone change and the

14 future development it allows.

15 120. Similarly, in City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino (2002) 96 Cal. App.

16 4th 398, 409, the court held that an EIR examining a change to a policy under a General Plan

17 "failed to consider such reasonably anticipated future development" that the change allowed. The

18 Court found that this inadequacy stemmed from a failure to accurately describe the proposed

19 project: "[E]valuation of a 'first phase-general plan amendment' must necessarily include a

20 consideration of the larger project, i.e. the future development permitted by the amendment.

21 Only then can the ultimate effect of the amendment upon the physical environment be

22 addressed." (Id.).

23 121. The EIR's myopic focus on the Mercury Lane Proposal, which will by itself have

24 very significant impacts, rather than on all future developments enabled by the PC Zone renders

25 the EIR inadequate. While the FEIR attempts to dismiss any obligation to evaluate such
26 development because "it is speculative to determine which industrial parcels would decide to

27 utilize the opportunities presented under the PC Zoning and what densities future residential

28

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

would propose," (FEIR at 2-63), reasonable forecasting is required under CEQA. (See Laurel

2 Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. App. 3d 376, 399).

122. Moreover, this statement in the FEIR is plainly incorrect. The non-speculative, 3

4 massive residential project known as The Village had already been proposed by the same
n developer directly across the street from the Mercury Lane Proposal. In fact, for a $20,000
6 planning fee, the developer had submitted The Village for review by the City under its Central

7 City Core planning process. By misconstruing the proposal as a single, isolated residential

8 project rather than the larger approval of a PC Zone, the DEIR violates CEQA. All impacts of

9 the PC Zone change, including the proposed project, The Village, and any reasonable forecasts

10 of other development enabled by the PC Zone change must be evaluated before development is

11 allowed to proceed

C. Improper Project Segmentation 12 49006 123. Real Party in Interest Mr. Manley submitted the Mercury Lane and The Village 8 0OEZ ALINS 'ISVA NAVA AANINIO 6POZ dIT ITEVNIA VUDO"OG6*U LE 13
'SILISNV S01 14 projects to the City together, and the City prepared a plan for a reviewing both developments

16 Dwight Manley, May 30, 2017). Planning staff developed a Central City Core planning process
considering both developments and the larger changes to the General Plan that they would

of residential 17

18 require.

19 124. The Mercury Lane Project and The Village are the same type

20 project, proposed by the same developer, in the same industrial area, and on the same block.

21 Indeed, Mr. Manley first proposed the Mercury Lane Project and The Village to the City as one

22 project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- Project's 114 units, for a total of 1,063 units. The CEQA analysis for the Mercury Lane Project

2 was conducted only for 114 units, roughly 10% of the number of units that Mr. Manley's has

3 proposed to develop on the block of Berry Street in Brea where the Mercury Lane Project is

4 located.

5 127. By dividing the Mercury Lane Project from The Village and larger PC Zone

6 change, Respondents unlawfully segmented Mr. Manley's proposed development and other

7 foreseeable development near the Mercury Lane Project, and thereby obscure the significance of

8 the Project's impacts in violation of CEQA.

9 D. Failure to Address and Mitigate Cumulative Impacts

10 128. CEQA required Respondents to address the cumulative effects of other

11 foreseeable proposals in reviewing the proposed Project.

49006 12 129. The DEIR includes Table 4-1, which lists several related cumulative projects
LAST, COT aE 1Y1TXVNEA 13 within two miles of the Mercury Lane Proposal, but makes no mention of The Village. In fact,
'S9TIONV ! XAVA ANNINIO 6POZ 10.220.900 14 The Village is not mentioned anywhere in the EIR, even though the same project proponent

15 proposed this larger development, the Village Site is across the street from the Mercury Lane

16 Project, and Mr. Manley previously proposed the two development sites as one project.

17 130. Development of The Village was a reasonably foreseeable project that the City

18 was required to evaluate in the EIR. Specifics of The Village are available for consideration now

19 and were available during CEQA review of the proposed Project. In 2017, Real Party in Interest

20 Mr. Manley acquired 6.5 acres across the street from the proposed Mercury Lane Project (on the

21 property line of Pacific Plastics' site). In December 2019, the applicant publicly announced plans

22 to entitle and build 949 apartments for families and seniors, plus a childcare facility. (See, e.g., P.

23 Brennan, "Mr. Brea Tries Solving Low-Cost Housing Riddle," ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS

24 JOURNAL (Dec. 16, 2020), available at https://www.ocbj.com/news/2019/dec/16/mr-brea-tries-

25 solving-low-cost-housing-riddle/).

26 131. The specifics of The Village were available to the City from the inception of the

27 Mercury Lane Project, and became a matter of public record well in advance of final project

28 approvals for the Mercury Lane Project. Indeed, Mr. Manley first proposed the Mercury Lane

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

t Project and The Village at the same time. Further residential intrusions into the industrial zone

2 around the Mercury Lane Project site and Petitioner's business, and associated environmental

3 and health impacts, are reasonably foresecable and are likely to cause cumulative impacts that

4 compound the significance of the Mercury Lane Project's impacts.

132. Even assuming that the City could segment its review of the Mercury Lane n

6 Project and The Village into separate EIRs, the City was required but failed to evaluate the

7 impacts of the Mercury Lane Project in light of the cumulative effects expected to be caused by

8 both the Mercury Lane and The Village projects. While the effects of the Mercury Lane Project

9 alone are significant, the cumulative effects of both projects on traffic, parking, air quality, noise,

133. Indeed, the FEIR itself acknowledges that "a proposed project is of statewide, and land use compatibility would be greater,

17 and decisionmakers, in violation of CEQA.

E. Failure to Evaluate and Mitigate Impacts 18

Respondents have also failed to adequately evaluate numerous direct, indirect, 19

20 20 and cumulative environmental impacts of approving the Mercury Lane Project and PC Zone, 135.

588 The Brea General Plan calls for "at least a 10 percent increase in industrial space including but not limited to the following.

square footage over the time horizon of the General Plan." (Brea General Plan at 2-123). The 136.

24 Mercury Lane Project would result in a decrease in industrial space square footage. Respondents
25 failed to evaluate or even mention the environmental impact of reducing the City's industrial

26

Land Use Designation. (Brea General Plan at 2-15). The Mercury Lane Project was approved in 137. The Brea General Plan establishes a maximum FAR of 0.75 in the Light Industrial square footage in the FEIR.

27

29 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 a Light Industrial Land Use Designation with a FAR of 2.06, well in excess of what the Brea

2 General Plan permits for its location. Respondents failed to evaluate or even mention the

3 environmental impact of exceeding the maximum FAR in the Light Industrial Land Use

4 Designation in the FEIR.

5 138. The City incorrectly states in the DEIR and Findings of Fact that CEQA does not

6 require the City to consider the impacts of nearby industrial operations on future residents. For

7 example, the DEIR states that "[p]er California Building Industry Association v. Bay Area Air

8 Quality Management District 62 Cal. 4th 369 (No. S 213478) ("CBIA v. BAAQMD"), noise

9 compatibility for onsite sensitive receptors is no longer the purview of CEQA." (DEIR at 5.5-8).

10 To the contrary, CBIA v. BAAQMD makes clear that CEQA requires an evaluation of the impacts

11 on future residents where a "project risks exacerbating existing conditions." (62 Cal. 4th at 378;

12 49006 VD 'SETADNV 2300 ELINS 'ISVI CENTURY PA 2049 see also Guidelines section 15126.2(a); East Sacramento P'ship for a Livable City v. City of LLP VENABLE 13 Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal. App. 5th 218, 296-97, as modified on denial of reh'g (Dec. 6, 2016);

14 AquAlliance v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (E.D. Cal. 2018) 287 F. Supp. 3d 969, 1027-28).

15 139. Indeed, the FEIR contradicts the DEIR statement that impacts on future residents

16 need not be considered. The FEIR states that "[s]imply attracting residents or users to a site

17 containing an environmental hazard or risk is not an impact that must be analyzed, but project-
18 induced changes that worsen an existing hazard or risk are." (DEIR 5.5-8 (Emphasis added)).

19 However, the DEIR summarily concludes that "[p]lacement of the project would not exacerbate

20 environmental hazards," therefore dismissing the need to evaluate the effects of exacerbated

21 environmental conditions on future residents. (DEIR 5.5-8). Such unexplained conclusions that

22 are not supported by factual information do not suffice. (CEQA Guidelines $ 15088(c)).

23 140. This unexplained and unsupported conclusion is contradicted by other portions of

24 the DEIR , which show that the proposed project will exacerbate noise, traffic, air quality, and

25 several other environmental conditions. For example, the record states "The Existing Zoning

26 Alternative would lessen environmental impacts in the areas of air quality, energy, GHG

27 emissions, land use and planning, noise, public services, recreation, transportation, tribal cultural

28

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 resources, and utilities and service systems." (Findings of Fact at 52). In other words, the

2 Mercury Lane Project exacerbates impacts to these resources.

3 141. Further, Respondents acknowledged that "the proposed residential structure could

4 introduce new stationary noise sources to the community, including mechanical equipment and

5 property maintenance."(DEIR 5.6-10). In other words, the Mercury Lane Project exacerbates

6 noise impacts. Respondents also states that "[i]mplementation of the proposed project would

7 result in significant cumulative impact at 3 intersections during the traffic peak hours (#10 -

8 Berry Street at Imperial Highway, #11 - Brea Boulevard at Imperial Highway, and #11 State

9 College Boulevard at Imperial Highway)." (DEIR 6-1; see also FEIR at 2-34 ["[T]he proposed

10 project would significantly contribute to delay at three intersections along Imperial Highway

11 (State Route 90)."].) In other words, the proposed project significantly exacerbates traffic

12 impacts, as well as associated noise and air quality impacts.
LLP ITEVNIA 210.220-0060 49006 VO 'SITHONV SOT 00EZ ELINS 'ISVA MIVI ANOINIO 6FOZ 13 142. These impacts of the Project would be added to existing impacts. The DEIR

14 acknowledges that "[d]irectly east, west, and north of the project site are warehouses/distribution

15 centers, which add to the existing noise environment primarily through truck loading and

16 unloading. Truck loading/unloading and machine noise at the adjacent and nearby industrial uses

17 could occur in the early morning hours when sensitive receptors are more sensitive to changes in

18 the ambient noise environment." (DEIR at 5.6-6). As discussed above, the DEIR errs by

19 understating existing conditions.

20 143. The DEIR irrationally states that noise impacts will be minimized because roads

21 used by industrial neighbors buffer the project site. (DEIR at 5.5-10 ("Further, uses west of the

22 project site are buffered by Berry Street, thereby reducing potential noise and hazard impacts.

23 Moreover, uses to the north of the project site and buffered by Mercury Lane and a parking lot

24 are predominantly used for trailer parking and do not consist of intensive industrial uses.")).

25 These statements are unreasonable, as roads do not provide a buffer against industrial noise. In

26 fact, substantial noise is generated by industrial truck traffic on the road itself.

27 144. The DEIR also unreasonably treats those effects as insubstantial because these

28 impacts may be mitigated. The DEIR does not specify mitigation or confirm that mitigation is

31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 possible. Rather, the DEIR impermissibly states that unspecified mitigations will be used to

2 achieve interior noise levels of 45 dba Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) after an

3 acoustic study is performed. The "preliminary interior noise study" included in the Staff Report

4 before the Planning Commission does not resolve this issue. The document shows that noise

5 levels measured at two locations substantially exceed 24 hours CNEL internal residential noise

6 level limits. Even with high STC window ratings (31), Table 6 shows that interior noise levels

7 with windows closed remains above the 45-dba limit. Moreover, Table 5 reveals that maximum

8 noise levels are very high at both locations, 106.2 during the day and 93.9 dba during the night.

9 Yet, the DEIR completely fails to evaluate Single Event Noise Exposure Levels (SENEL), and

10 the synergistic impacts of the Project in increasing the severity of these noise levels. These single

11 event noise level exposures can be particularly significant for residents at night and should have

12 been considered in the EIR but were not. (See Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd. Of

UUDOTDG6U LS 49006 VO 'SETIONV SOI 0DET ALINS 'ISVI MAVAAMNINEO 6YOZ LLP NIAVNIA 13 Port Comm'rs (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, as modified on denial of reh'g (Sept. 26, 2001)).

14 145. The DEIR acknowledges that baseline air quality conditions present substantial

15 health risks. See, e.g., DEIR at 5.1-13 - 14. The DEIR explains that a Multiple Air Toxics

16 Exposure Study (MATES) shows an estimated excess cancer risk of 1128.6 per million people
due to lifetime exposure to ambient levels of air toxics in the area. (See DEIR at 5.1-13). The
largest contributor to health risk is diesel exhaust from mobile sources, followed by toxic air 17

18

19 contaminants from stationary sources. (DEIR at 5.1-13). Additionally, "[t]he most current five

20 years of data monitored at [nearby] monitoring stations show recurring violations of both the

21 state and federal 03 standards" in the area. (DEIR at 5.1-14).

22 146. The Mercury Lane Project would exacerbate these existing air quality conditions

23 through vehicular and construction-related emissions by the Project as well as through increased

24 emissions from other vehicles due to the Project's impacts on traffic and parking conditions.

25 147. With respect to parking-related impacts, the FEIR unreasonably states that "[n]o

26 physical environmental impacts would occur from the reduction in parking proposed by the

27 project."(FEIR 2-64). Existing conditions in the area show that this unsupported assertion is

28 incorrect. Pacific Plastics and other industrial users currently do a good job of reducing truck

32
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

-

2 idling on their own properties and on the legal street parking spaces (trucks sometimes use street

3 parking to queue for access to the manufacturing plant). However, a foresecable impact of the

4 proposed project is a reduction of available street parking for the existing industrial users. A

5 reduction in available street parking would result in many trucks having to idle and/or circle the

6 area while awaiting access to the plant, contributing to both air quality (diesel emissions) and
noise impacts.

7 148.

8 Accordingly, the EIR fails to adequately consider parking impacts and the

9 associated secondary impacts on traffic, noise, safety, and air quality. (See Covina Residents for

10 Responsible Development v. City of Covina (2018) 21 Cal. App. 5th 712, 726 [recognizing that

'SITI5NV SO1 2049 CENUE ARNOALMS, LAST, SoTTE 2300 L9006 11 "secondary parking impacts caused by ensuing traffic congestion (air quality, noise, safety, or

any

12
JTT NTAVNIA other impact associated with transportation') must be addressed")).

149.

210-220-0000 13 This failure to address parking impacts and associated secondary impacts cannot

14 be excused by the statement in the FEIR that unspecified future mitigation will be implemented

15 to address the parking impacts. (FEIR at 2-33 ["As stated on pages 4.4-11 through 5.5-12, the

16 City of Brea will review the parking study and may impose additional conditions to ensure that

17 the proposed parking demand of the project is satisfied. Review by the City would ensure that

18 the project would provide adequate parking and would not result in a physical impact on the

19 environment.")). The EIR must evaluate the secondary parking impacts and possible mitigations,

not postpone

20 150. that evaluation until it is too late to inform the public and decisionmakers.

21 Indeed, the DEIR itself acknowledges that the presence of "truck trips that idle

22 onsite" can "warrant a health risk assessment." (Findings of Fact at 26; DEIR at 5.5-6). As the

23 South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) made clear in its comment letter, a

24 Health Risk Assessment (HRA) is required in order to understand the effects of exacerbated air

25 quality impacts on future residents. The SCAQMD recommended that the City perform an HRA

26 and include strategies to maximize protection against exposures to toxic air contaminants such as

27 diesel particulate matter in the EIR. Yet the FEIR does not include any discussion of the

28 potential long-term health risks to residents who will live at the Mercury Lane Project in close

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

proximity to a railroad track, manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and a high-traffic

2 highway.

151. The City's apparent reasoning for dismissing the need for an HRA is factually
f flawed. The DEIR estimated truck traffic generated by the adjacent properties at 100 trips per
day. Yes, in a footnote, the DEIR appears to assert that an HRA is not required because there

6 are fewer than 100 truck trips per day around the proposed project. (See DEIR at 5.5-8 at n.1

7 ("The California Air Resources Board 2005 Air Quality Land Use Handbook defines land uses

8 with more than 100 truck trips per day as having the potential to elevate health risk.")). As

9 discussed above, the City unreasonably concluded that there were fewer than 100 truck trips per

10 day by (a) not counting any truck trip not associated with an immediately abutting property, and

11 (b) underestimating the truck trips associated with other abutting properties. In addition, in 006Z ZLINS EAST, MAVA ANAINIO 6POZ 12 deciding not to complete the HRA that SCAQMD found to be required, Respondents VENABLE LLP UUDD-oc6UEt 49006 VO 'SATIONY SO1 13 unreasonably failed to consider emissions generated by nearby stationary sources, freight

14 deliveries, and Imperial Highway.

15 152. Respondents have unlawfully failed and/or refused to perform their duties under

16 CEQA and, unless the Court mandates Respondents to comply with CEQA, will continue to fail

17 and refuse to perform the duties imposed on it by California law.

18 153. Petitioner has no available administrative remedies. Petitioner has no plain,

19 speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, other than the relief sought herein.

20 154. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition,

21 including by complying with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code section 21167.5 by serving

22 notice of the commencement of this action prior to filing it with this Court.

23 155. The issuance of a writ of mandate, as sought by Petitioner, will result in the

24 enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, and will confer a significant

25 benefit on the general public, as it will require compliance with CEQA, which was enacted to

26 protect and preserve the environment and to safeguard the public health.

2 mandatory duties imposed on Respondents and/or constitutes action that is contrary to law, an
3 abuse of discretion, and/or arbitrary and capricious.

public, including Pacific Plastics, on notice of the Study Sessions or the proposed Project they
addressed. The lack of adequate notice significantly prejudiced Pacific Plastics and undermined

7 the public's ability to inform review of the proposed Project, while providing Mr. Manley a

8 platform to advocate for his proposal without opposition.

9 165. In fact, the first notice received by Petitioner regarding the Mercury Lane Project

10 was the mailed notice of the Planning Commission meeting to be held on January 28, 2020, well

11 after the draft FEIR was completed. By that time, the Mercury Lane Project had been before the

12 City since at least May of 2017, and had been discussed by the Planning Commission for nearly 49006 VO 'S9T19NV SOT OOEZ ALINS 'ISVI XAVIANNINIS 6FOZ LLP ITAVNAA UUOD"DGG"ULE 13 SIX months before Pacific Plastics received a single mailed notice.
In addition to the violations of the Government Code, Respondents have violated 14

15 the noticing requirements in the BMC. (See BMC § 20.416.030(B)). The BMC requires that 166.

16 "[a]ny hearing on a zoning matter may be continued from time to time and place to place,

17 provided the time and place to which it is continued is announced prior to adjournment of the

18 meeting from which continued." (Id.). The Planning Commission continued its discussion of the

19 Mercury Lane Project from February 25, 2020 to March 24, 2020, but did not meet on March 24,

20 2020 and did not issue a further continuance.

The BMC also required that public notices of a hearing on the Project to be 21

mailed to all property owners within 500 feet of the Project site. (See BMC § 20.416.020(E)). 167.

22

23 This establishes the legal minimum notice area, though the City has the right to require wider

24 notice if, in the judgment of City Staff, such wider notice is reasonably necessary to properly

25 inform those members of the Brea Community who would or could be directly impacted by a

1 Project will significantly impacts are beyond the 500-foot radius. Respondents adopted

2 overriding considerations to the detriment of all neighbors near those intersections, and did so

3 without specifically noticing residents in those communities

4 169. Moreover, Petitioner is located right across the street from the Mercury Lane

5 Project within 500-feet of the Project site. In violation of BMC § 20.416.030(B)), the City did

6 not provide mailed notice to Petitioner until after all five studies session had been held, the DEIR

7 had been released, and the draft FEIR had been completed.

170. Respondents have unlawfully failed and/or refused to perform their duty to 8

9 properly notice the public and to conduct open and transparent public meetings in violation of

10 the Brown Act and the BMC. Unless the Court mandates it to do so, will continue to fail and

11 refuse to perform the duties imposed on it by the BMC and California law.

14 172. The issuance of a writ of mandate, as sought by Petitioner, will result in the

15 enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, and will confer a significant

16 benefit on the general public, as it will require compliance with the Brown Act, which was

17 enacted to protect and preserve the public's right to open and transparent conduct of the people's

18 business.

19 173. The City of Brea's failure and/or refusal to comply with the Brown Act and BMC

20 violates mandatory duties imposed on Respondents and/or constitutes action that is contrary to

21 law, an abuse of discretion, and/or arbitrary and capricious.

22 174. Therefore, a Writ of Mandate should issue directing Respondents to (i) rescind all

23 approvals for the Mercury Lane Project and (ii) properly notice all Study Sessions and other

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 1
(For Writ of Mandate due to Violation of the Brea Municipal Code § 20.272.030(G)(6)- 2
C.C.P. §§ 1085, 1094.5, BMC § 20.272.030(G)(6)) 3

175. Petitioner Pacific Plastics hereby incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully
5 set forth herein.

6 176. Respondents have a clear, mandatory duty to comply with the Brea Municipal

7 Code.

8 177. Even assuming the Mercury Lane Project was consistent with the Brea General

9 Plan and with the Government Code, the City did not follow its own procedures in adopting the
10 Mercury Lane PC Zone.

11 178. The BMC sets out five findings the City must make before adopting a Planned

12 Community Master Plan: (i) the Planned Community Master Plan is consistent with the General
JTT JTEVNIA 49006 VO 'SITEONY SOT ELINS 'ISVE MEVA XMOINIO 6POZ UUDO-DLG-ULS 13 Plan; (ii) the Planned Community Master Plan is consistent with the Brea Envisions Community

14 Strategic plan; (iii) the Planned Community master Plan would provide for innovative

15 development in an area that presents unique planning challenges due to considerations such as
16 geography, topography, and changing patterns of development; (iv) the proposed development
17 within the PC Zone is suitable "in terms of access, size, their relationship to adjacent properties
18 and similar or related uses; and (v) the Planned Community Master Plan "is in the best interest of

19 the City as a whole." (BMC § 20.272.030(G)(6) [emphasis added]).

20 179. With respect to the first finding, the Mercury Lane PC Zone is inconsistent with

21 the Brea General Plan. As discussed at length above, the Mercury Lane PC Zone would allow for

22 residential uses in Light Industrial Land Use Designation despite the Brea General Plan's

23 recognition of a shortage of industrial buildings and explicit provision for "at least a 10 percent
24 increase in industrial space."(Brea General Plan at 2-123). Additionally, the Mercury Lane PC

25 Zone allows for a FAR of 2.06, despite the Brea General Plan's explicit maximum FAR of 0.75
26 in a Light Industrial Land Use Designation. (Id. at 2-15).

27 180. With respect to the second finding, initiative four of the Brea Envisions

28 Community Strategic Plan states that the City will "maintain a consistent and acceptable balance

38
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 of both residential and commercial/industrial development." (See Brea Envisions Community

2 Strategic Plan at 19). The City has not explained or provided a sufficient factual basis to explain
0 t  0 how this requirement is met. Rather, the City only addressed the benefits of more housing
without discussing the detriments of reducing industrial square footage.

181. With respect to the third finding, the Mercury Lane Project presents no unique
planning challenges and no aspects of the proposal justify the use of PC zoning. The City has not

7 explained or provided a sufficient factual basis to explain how this requirement is met. The

8 Mercury Lane Project Site does not present any particular geographic or topographic challenges.

9 Patterns of development at or round the Mercury Lane Project site have not changed prior to the

10 Project.
With respect to the fourth finding, the City must conclude that the proposed 11 182. OOST ALINS 'ISVA MIVI AMNINIS 6FOZ 12 development within the PC zone is suitable "in terms of access, size, their relationship to
LLP ENABLE VUDO"DLG-ULt 49006 VD 'SII29NV SOT 13 adjacent properties and similar or related uses." (BMC § 20.272.030(G)(6)) [emphasis added]).

14 The BMC states directly that the PC zone is intended to be is an innovative tool "while respecting

15 existing uses." (BMC § 20.272.010(B) [emphasis added]). The City has not explained or

16 provided a sufficient factual basis to explain how this requirement is met. The proposed

17 residential development is inconsistent with applicable zoning and land use requirements at the

18 site, and is plainly unsuitable in terms of its relationship to the adjacent very active industrial

19 properties.
With respect to the fifth finding, the City has not adequately explained or 20

provided a sufficient factual basis to explain why the Project is in the best interest of the 183.

21

22 community as a whole. Respondents cannot conclude the Mercury Lane PC Zone is in the best

23 interest of the City as a whole without weighing potential negatives associated with the Mercury

24 Lane Project and conducting an analysis of how those negatives compare to the positives

25 associated with placing a residential development in an industrial zone.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 185. Petitioner has no available administrative remedies. Petitioner has no plain,

2 speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, other than the relief sought herein.
01 4 186. The issuance of writ of mandate, as sought by Petitioner, will result in the
enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, and will confer a significant
benefit on the general public, as it will require compliance with the duly enacted laws of the City

6 of Brea, which were enacted to protect public health, safety, and welfare.

7 187. Respondents' failure and/or refusal to comply with the BMC violates mandatory

8 duties imposed on Respondents and/or constitutes action that is contrary to law, an abuse of

9 discretion, and/or arbitrary and capricious.

10 188. Therefore, a Writ of Mandate should issue directing Respondents to (i) rescind all

11 approvals for the Mercury Lane Project and (ii) comply with the BMC before further considering

12 the Mercury Lane Project and any further PC Zone. LLP ATEVNHA 49006 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 8 2049 CENTURY PARK EAST, SUITE 2300 'SETR9NV SOT s E (For Declaratory Relief Under C.C.P. § 1060)

15 189. Petitioner hereby incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

16 190. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and

17 Respondents concerning the obligations and duties of Respondents under municipal and state

18 law. As set forth above, Petitioner contends that the City's review and approval of the Mercury

19 Lane Project, review and approval of the PC Zone, and certification of the associated EIR

20 violated the Brea General Plan, CEQA, the Brea Municipal code, the Brown Act, and California

21 statutory law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

22 contend in all respects to the contrary. A judicial determination and declaration as to the legality

23 of the City's review and approval of the Mercury Lane Project and PC Zone Amendment, and

24 certification of the associated EIR is therefore necessary and appropriate in order to determine

25 the duties of Respondents and the rights of Petitioner.
