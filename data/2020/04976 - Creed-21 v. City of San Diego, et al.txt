12 Plaintiff and Petitioner, VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY
13 VS. RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA 14 CITY OF SAN DIEGO; CALIFORNIA COASTAL ) ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, THE

15 I COMMISSION; and DOES through 100, CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT, AND OTHER LAWS
Defendants and Respondents.
16

17 DOES 101 through 1,000,
Defendants and Real Parties in Interest.
18

19 Plaintiff and Petitioner CREED-21 ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

20 Parties

21 1. Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State

22 of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in, or near, the City of San Diego,

23 California, and has an interest in, among other things, ensuring compliance with environmental laws
24 and protecting the City's quality of life.

25 2a. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO ("CITY") is a "public agency" under
26 Public Resources Code Section 21063 and "local government" under Public Resources Code Section
27 30109. As a "public agency," CITY is required to comply with California Environmental Quality Act
28 | ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.

2b. Defendant and Respondent CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION
2 ("COMMISSION") is a "public agency" under Public Resources Code Section 21063 and the
3 "commission" under Public Resources Code Section 30105(a). COMMISSION's primary responsibility

4 consists of administration of the California Coastal Act.

5 3. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents/Real Parties in Interest
6 identified as DOES 1 through 1,000 are unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission
7 to amend this pleading in order to allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.

8 Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis allegs that each of the fictitiously named DOES
through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the proposed project that is the
10 subject of this procceding and DOES 101 through 1,000 has some other cognizable interest in the
11 subject matter of this lawsuit.
12 Background Information

13 4. On or about March 19, 2019, CITY approved its so-called Parking Requirement
14 Regulatory Reform for Multifamily Residential Development in Transit Priority Areas, as reflected in
15 Ordinance no. 0-21057 and Resolution nos. R-312234 and 312235 (collectivoly, the "Project"). In
16 general terms, the Project eliminates minimum parking-space requirements for multifamily housing
17 projects. CITY determined that the Project is exempt from environmental review under CEQA.
18 Petitioner opposes the Project based on CITY's failure to subject the Project to CEQA,
19 5. To the extent any portion of the Project constituted an amendment to CITY's local
20 coastal program and would thus govern future development activities in the coastal zone (the "LCP
21 Amendmont'), CITY submitted the Project to COMMISSION for certification of the LCP Amendment
22 as consistent with the Coastal Act based on CITY's prior approval of, and exemption determination for,
23 the Project. After this lawsuit was filed, COMMISSION certified the LCP Amendment as consistent
24 with the Coastal Act. Petitioner opposes COMMISSION's certification of the LCP Amendment to the
25  extent the submission was the product of CITY's violation of CEQA.

26 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations
27 6. This proceeding is being commenced not more than 35 days after the notice described
28 in Public Resources Code Section 21167(d) was filed with the county clerk (if such notice was filed).

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 2

l 7. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on
2 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct
3 copy of the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."
8. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General
5 not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
6 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

7 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

8 9. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
9 Sections 21168 and/or 21168.5, as applicable, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 1060 et seq.,

10 and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
11 10. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Alternatively

12 and additionally, neitber Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion-of-
13 remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
14 11. Defendants/Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with

15 CEQA and other applicable laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this
16 pleading, they failed to proceed in a manner required by law,
Z
17 12. Petitioner has noplain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since

18 its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
19| Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other applicable laws. Defendants/Respondents'
20 approval of the Project also rests on their failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in
21 accordance with the applicable laws. Even when Defendants/Respondents are permitted or required
22 by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear,
23 present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with
24 those laws. Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve

25 the Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but

26 Defendants/Respondents have failed and refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond
27 the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

28

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

1 13. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants/Respondents' fulfillment of
2 all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: Illegal Approval of Project
4 (Against All Defendants/Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

5 14. Paragraphs 1 through 13 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

6 15. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
7 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):

8 A. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:

9 i. CEQA applies to every discretionary project proposed to be carried out
10 of approved by a public agency, unless the project is exempt from CEQA. Generally speaking, the
11 public agency must review the potentially significant environmental impacts of every discretionary
12 project subject to CEQA review that the agency proposes to carry out or approve. Such review involves
13 determining whether the proposal is exempt, should be the subject of a negative declaration, or should
14 be the subject of an environmental impact report.
15 ii. The use of a CEQA exemption is inappropriate when a project may have
16 significant environmental impacts or when there are potentially significant environmental impacts due
17 to unusual circumstances.

18 iti. The Project constitutes "project" under CEQA because its approval
19 involved the exercise of discretion and has the potential to cause significant direct, indirect, or
20 cumulative adverse impacts (if not all such impacts) on the environment, including but not limited to
21 conflicts in CITY's land-use and zoning regulations.

22 iv. These significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the

23 environment give rise to CITY's legal obligation to subject the Project to CEQA review.
24 V. CITY's refusal to apply CEQA to the Project and subject it to
25 environmental review constitutes a violation of CEQA.

26 vi. Owing to its violation of CEQA, CITY lacked the authority to submit the
27 LCP Amendment to COMMISSION for a consistency certification under the Coastal Act.
28 Consequently, COMMISSION had no authority to take action on CITY's submission.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

1 vii. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violation of CEQA and the
2 Coastal Act, Petitioner has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public,
3 and the responsible decision-makers were not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental

4 impacts of the Project, and insofar as Petitioner, its members, and other members of the public did not
5 have an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the
6 Project.

7 16. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Defendants/Respondents over the
8 Project's legal force and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because
9 it violates CEQA, the Coastal Act, and/or one or more other applicable laws. Defendants/Respondents

10 dispute Petitioner's contention. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's
11  legal force and effect (if any).

12 Prayer

13 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against
14 Defendants/Respondents (and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this proceeding):

15 A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that
16 Defendants/Respondents failed to fully comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws
17 as they relate to the Project and that there must be full compliance therewith before final approval and

18 implementation of the Project may occur;

19 B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that
20 Defendants/Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they
21 relate to the Project and that its approval and implementation was illegal in at least some respect,
22 rendering the approval and implementation null and void;
23 C. Injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants/Respondents (and any and all persons acting at
24 the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from taking any action on any
25 aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until Defendants/Respondents
26 comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws, as determined by the Court;
27 D. Any and all other relief that may be authorized by CEQA or other applicable laws, or
28 any combination of them, but is not explicitly or specifically requested elsewhere in this Prayer,

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page:

E. Any and all legal fees and other expenses incurred by Petitioner in connection with this
2 proceeding, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil
3 Procedure; and

4 F.

5 Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
Date: December 26, 2019.
