VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner THE PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FOUNDATION ("Petitioner")
2 alleges as follows in this Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to the California
3 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Other Laws:
4

5 Introduction

6 1. This case challenges the adoption of an amendment to a policy a of the STATE
7 WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ("the Board"). The Board's decision allows
8 admittedly harmful once-through-cooling power plants ("OTC plants") to operate after
9 2020, without properly analyzing or minimizing the myriad post-2020 environmental
10 impacts likely to occur. This action alleges that the Board's adoption of its new 2020 policy
11 allowing certain OTC plants to operate after 2020 violates CEQA and other laws.
Parties 12

13 2. a Petitioner is a nonprofit public benefit corporation formed and existing under
14 California law with headquarters in San Diego. It is organized exclusively for charitable,
15 educational, and public purposes. Petitioner represents the interests of San Diego and

16 Southern California residential ratepayers in proceedings before the California Public

17 Utilities Commission, the State Water Resources Control Board, other state bodies, and in

18 the courts. Petitioner advocates against unreasonably costly and unnecessary fossil-fueled

19 utility projects, in support of just and reasonable utility rates, and in support of fair,
20 reasonable, and responsible energy practices, polices, rules, and laws. Petitioner seeks to

21 obtain enforcement of the public duties that are the subject of this lawsuit.

22 3. Respondent the Board is a public agency under Section 21063 of the Public
23 Resources Code. The Board is authorized and required by law to hold public hearings, to

24 determine the adequacy of and certify environmental documents prepared pursuant to CEQA,

25 and to take other actions in connection with the approval of projects within its jurisdiction.

26 The Board concedes that it is the lead agency under CEQA and responsible for preparing

27 environmental documentation.

1 4. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in

2 Interest AES does business in California and is the owner or operator of Alamitos Generating

3 Station Units 3, 4, and 5 (Alamitos); Huntington Beach Generating Station Unit 2

4 (Huntington Beach); and Redondo Beach Generating Station Units 5, 6, and 8 (Redondo

5 Beach).

6 5. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in

7 Interest GenOn California South GP, LLC is a Delaware entity doing business in California

8 and is the owner and operator of Ormond Beach Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (Ormond

9 Beach).

10 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in
11 Interest Pacific Gas & Electric Company is a California corporation and the owner and

12 operator of Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant (Diablo Canyon).

13 7. The true names and capacities of Respondents identified as DOES 1 through

14 100 and Real Parties in Interest identified as ROES 101 through 200 are unknown to

15 Petitioner, which will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to allege

16 the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and

17 believes and on that basis alleges that each of the fictitiously-named Respondents 1 through

18 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the project that is the subject of this

19 proceeding and that each of the fictitiously-named Real Parties in Interest 101 through 200

20 either claims an ownership interest in the proposed project or has some other cognizable

21 interest herein.

22 Background Information

23 8. The Board is a statutory state agency required to formulate state policy for

24 water quality control that conforms to the water and environmental protection policies set

25 forth by the California Legislature; and the state agency designated as the state water

26 pollution control agency for the purposes set forth in the Clean Water Act.

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I 9. The Board held scoping meetings under CEQA beginning in mid-2006 and
2 continuing throughout 2008 to consider imposing controls on coast power plants subject to
3 its jurisdiction, having been urged by the Ocean Protection Council and others to implement
4 protective controls on coastal power plants and because Section 316 of the Clean Water Act

5 requires "that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake
6 structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental
7 impact" (33 U.S.C., ยง 1326, subd. (b)).

8 10. The Board formed an Expert Review Panel in 2008, circulated a draft a Water

9 Quality Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling
10 on June 30, 2009, circulated a draft Substitute Environmental Document (SED) on July 15,

11 2009, and held public hearings in September and December of 2009.

12 11. On May 4, 2010, the Board adopted State Water Resources Control Board
13 Resolution No. 2010-0020, entitled Adopt a Proposed "Water Quality Control Policy on the

14 Use of Costal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling" and Associated Certified

15 Regulatory Program Environmental Analysis (2010 Resolution")

16 12. In the 2010 Resolution, the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Policy on

17 the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling ("the Policy"). Distilled to

18 its basics, the Policy required that all nineteen power plants located on California's coast

19 then using one-through-cooling ("OTC") systems ("OTC plants") either close, or ensure the

20 plants are using the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts,l

21 or equivalent operational or structural controls, by specific dates.

22 13. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the owners or

23 operators of Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond Beach, and Redondo Beach elected to

24 close. The Policy thus requires that Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond Beach, and

25 Redondo Beach cease operations by December 31, 2020.

26 14. When it adopted the Policy, the Board also certified the Water Quality Control

27 Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling Final Substitute

28 Environment Document ("Final SED").

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 15.

2 According to the 2010 Resolution, the 2010 Final SED "was prepared in

3 accordance with the requirements of the State Water Board's certified regulatory CEQA

D process..." (2010 Resolution, p. 5.)
16.

5 The 2010 Resolution made explicit that the Final SED was intended "as a Tier

6 environmental review," and that the Board had "considered the reasonably foreseeable

7 consequences of adoption of the draft Policy; however potential site-specific project impacts

8 may need to be considered in any subsequent environmental analysis...." (2010 Resolution,

9 p. 5.) The Board did not make any statement of overriding considerations pursuant to

10 CEQA. (Cal. Code Regs., tit 14, ยง 15093; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, ยง 3779.5, subd. (c).)
17.

11 On or about March 18, 2020, the Board released a draft amendment which

12 proposed changes inconsistent with the 2010 Policy. The Board held a public workshop on

13 April 21, 2020, set a deadline of May 11, 2020 for public comment, and noticed the public

14 hearing and meeting to consider adoption of the proposed draft amendment to the 2010

15 Policy for July 21, 2020. After hundreds of comments were filed, the Board delayed

16 consideration of the proposed draft changes until its September 1, 2020 meeting.
18.

17 On September 1, 2020, the Board adopted State Water Resources Control Board

18 Resolution No. 2020-0029, Amendment to the Water Quality Control Policy on the Use of

19 Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling to Revise Compliance Schedules for

20 Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormand Beach, and Redondo Beach Generating Stations and

21 Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant ("the 2020 Resolution").
19.

22 The 2020 Resolution adopted (1) the Final Amendment to the Water Quality

23 Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling to

24 Revise Compliance Schedules for Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond Beach, and

25 Redondo Beach Generating Stations and Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant Final Staff

26 Report ("Staff Report"); and (2) the Final Amendment to the Water Quality Control Policy

27 on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling to Revise Compliance

28 Schedules for Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond Beach, and Redondo Beach Generating
Stations and Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plan (*2020 OTC Policy Amendment").

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 20. In contrast with the 2010 Policy, the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment allows for

2 post-2020 operations of the Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormand Beach, and Redondo
tw v Beach OTC plants none of which are utilizing the best technology available as required by
state and federal law, and without analyzing the environmental impacts of post-2020
operations or mitigating the adverse environmental impacts that admittedly will occur.
6 Specifically, the OTC Policy Amendment allows Redondo Beach to operate at least until

7 December 31, 2021 and it allows Alamitos, Huntington Beach, and Ormand Beach to operate
8 at least until December 31, 2023.

21. At no point leading up to adoption of the 2020 Resolution, the Policy, and the

10 Final SED, did the Board purport to analyze or mitigate the adverse environmental impacts

11 of post-2020 once-through-cooling operations at the Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond

12 Beach, or Redondo Beach locations.

13 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations

14 22. The Board decided to amend the OTC Policy at its September 1, 2020 meeting.

15 No notice of decision, notice of determination, nor notice of exemption has been filed.

16 Petitioner commences this proceeding not more than 30 days after the September 1, 2020

17 meeting at which the Board reversed its 2010 Policy and adopted its 2020 OTC Policy

18 Amendment.

19 23. Petitioner has given notice to Respondent of its intent to bring this action;

20 Petitioner is notifying the Attorney General of this action; and Petitioner elects to prepare

21 the administrative record. Copies of these notices are attached hereto as Exhibits "A" and

22 "B," respectively.

23 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

24 24. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources

25 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5, as applicable, among other provisions of law.

26 25. Petitioner has satisfied each and every exhaustion-of-remedies requirement that

27 must be satisfied in order to maintain this proceeding. Alternatively, neither Public

28 Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion requirement applies.

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I 26. In particular, the violations of law and environmental impacts alleged in this

2 proceeding were identified for Respondents orally and in writing by Petitioner and others

3 prior to the close of the public hearing on the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment, as required by

4 Public Resources Code Section 21167(a). By way of example and not limitation, Petitioner
5 and hundreds of others submitted comment letters within the designated comment period

6 and commented orally at the hearing. Petitioner's and others' comment letters contained

7 detailed explanations of the violations of law accruing and consequences likely to result

8 from the Board's actions and failures to act,

27. Respondent's conduct in approving the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment and in

10 purporting to comply with CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as is

11 explained herein, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law, its decision is

12 not supported by the findings, its findings are not supported by substantial evidence, and

13 Respondent acted in excess of its jurisdiction.

14 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

15 law, and Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondent's

16 violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondent's approval of the OTC Policy Amendment

17 also rests on its failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with

18 CEQA and other laws. Even when Respondent is permitted or required by law to exercise

19 discretion in approving projects under those laws, Respondent remains under a clear,

20 present, ministerial duty to exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a manner

21 consistent with those laws. Respondent has failed and refused to do so. It has exercised its

22 discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

23 29. Petitioner seeks to ensure the public receives the benefits to which it is entitled

24 under CEQA, which "was enacted to (1) inform the government and public about a

25 proposed activity's potential environmental impacts; (2) identify ways to reduce, or avoid,

26 those impacts; (3) require project changes through alternatives or mitigation measures when

27 feasible; and (4) disclose the government's rational for approving a project." (Protecting

28 Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 488.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report N m + .0 A (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
30. Paragraphs 1 through 29 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
31. CEQA requires public agency to prepare an environmental impact report
(*EIR") before approving a project that may have significant environmental effects. (Pub.
Res. Code, ยง 21100.) The EIR is "the heart of CEQA," an "environmental 'alarm bell'
whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes

8 before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Laurel Heights Improvement

9 รssn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392, quoting County of

10 Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.)

11 32. The Board is governed by CEQA's requirement to prepare an EIR for reasons

12 including that the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment does not meet the requirements of Public

13 Resources Code section 21080.5. (See Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry (1994) 7

14 Cal.4th 1215, 1230.)

15 33. Neither the 2020 Resolution, the 2020 Staff Report, nor the 2020 OTC Policy

16 Amendment contain an evaluation consistent with environmental protection purposes or

17 minimize significant biological, air quality, human health, land use, wetlands, ocean, and

18 climate change effects. (Pub. Res. Code, ยง 21080.5, subd. (d).)

19 34. The September 2020 OTC Policy Amendment constitutes a new project under

20 CEQA because it is different from and inconsistent with the purpose of the 2010 Policy that

21 was described and assessed in the 2010 Final SED certified by the Board. (See Friends of

22 College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1

23 Cal.5th 937, 960.)

24 35. Alternatively, the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment constitutes a later activity that

25 "may cause significant environmental effects not examined in the first tier" Final SED.

26 (Ibid., quoting Friends of Mammoth v. Town of Mammoth Lakes Rede velopment Agency

27 (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 511, 528.)

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36. The Board failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA by failing to

2 prepare an EIR or its equivalent before approving the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment, the

3 Staff Report, and the 2020 Resolution.
37. Instead, the Staff Report purported to constitute an addendum to the Final SED
w adopted in 2010, but an addendum cannot be used for an activity a decade later that is
6 inconsistent with the originally-analyzed program or that would have effects that were not

7 previously examined in an EIR or its equivalent. (Cal. Code Regs., ยง 15168, subd. (c)(1).)

8 38. Nor can an addendum be used where, as here, the Staff Report describes new

9 information of substantial importance which was not known in 2010, or where changes in

10 circumstances involving new and increased significant environmental effects, such as with

11 respect to climate change, wetlands, air quality, and ocean and human health. (Cal. Code

12 Regs., ยง 15164, subd. (a).).

13 39. Nor would it be appropriate to use an addendum to make substantial changes to

14 a decade-old policy given the myriad environmental laws enacted since that time, including

15 but not limited to post-2020 greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements enacted in

16 2016. (See e.g. Health & Safety Code, ยง 38566.) The 2010 Final SED did not consider

17 recent climate science and climate change-related legislation.

18 40. The climate change impacts accruing from post-2020 operation of the fossil-

19 fueled OTC plants that do not utilize the best technology available were not considered at the

20 time the Final SED was approved in 2010. The 2010 Final SED did not consider the post-

21 2020 climate change impacts of the OTC plants at the Alamitos, Huntington Beach, Ormond

22 Beach, or Redondo Beach locations.

23 41. Nor could the 2010 Final SED have considered the impacts of Clean Water Act

24 non-compliance after 2020, including but not limited to compliance with federal regulations

25 approved in 2014.

26 42. The 2020 OTC Policy Amendment will increase pollution and other greenhouse

27 gases in disadvantaged and other communities, without any scientific analysis, in violation of

28 CEQA. (See e.g. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ยง 15064.4, subd. (a).)

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43. Adding greenhouse gas emissions after 2020 contradicts myriad California

2 statutory mandates which require that greenhouse gas emissions be reduced after 2020, and
which recognize the scientific basis for requiring greenhouse gas emissions reductions. As

4 Executive Order B-55-18 stated in 2018: "scientists agree that worldwide carbon pollution
must start trending downward by 2020." (Executive Order B-55-18 [establishing a "new

6 statewide goalโฆto achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible, and no later than 2045, and
achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter"].) Allowing for greenhouse gas

8 emissions after 2020 that under the 2010 Policy would not be emitted conflicts with the

9 scientific consensus that avoiding the most catastrophic climate change impacts requires

10 substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions after 2020.

11 44. The Legislature has recognized that "[c]ontinuing to reduce greenhouse

12 gas emissions is critical for the protection of all areas of the state, but especially for

13 the state's most disadvantaged communities, as those communities are affected first,

14 and, most frequently, by the adverse impacts of climate change, including an

15 increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as drought, heat, and flooding.

16 The state's most disadvantaged communities also are disproportionately impacted by

17 the deleterious effects of climate change on public health." (Stats. 2016, Ch. 249, ยง 1,

18 subd. (c).)

19 45. The Board also failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA by failing to

20 assess properly the baseline environmental impacts which, under CEQA, must reflect the

21 "real conditions on the ground." a (Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air

22 Quality Management Dist. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 321.)

23 46. The Board is therefore subject to this Court's writ that the September 1, 2020

24 Resolution and associated documents are null and void, and directing the Board to prepare an

25 EIR for the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Failure to Mitigate
2 (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
47. Paragraphs 1 through 46 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

4 48. Whether or not the 2020 Resolution, the 2020 OTC Policy Amendment, and

5 the Staff Report could be considered as consistent with a certified regulatory program, the

6 Board is required to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of the OTC Policy

7 Amendment. (Pub. Res. Code, ยง 21002 ["โฆpublic agencies should not approve projects as

8 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures availableโฆl; Cal.

9 Code Regs., tit. 14, ยง 15250 ["A certified program remains subject to other provisions in

10 CEQA such as the policy of avoiding significant adverse effects on the environment where

11 feasible."]).

12 49. Mitigation measures must be a incorporated into a project before the project can

13 be approved. (Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 401-402; Cal. Code Regs., tit. ยง 14, ยง 15004.)

14 50. Prior to approving the OTC Policy Amendment, the Board failed to incorporate

15 mitigation measures that would minimize the environmental impacts of the 2020 OTC Policy

16 Amendment.

17 51. Moreover, the Board erroneously disclaimed responsibility to mitigate non-

18 marine environmental impacts, including with respect to wetlands, air quality, land use, and

19 others. (See City of San Diego V. Board of Trustees of California State University (2015) 61

20 Cal.4th 945.)
