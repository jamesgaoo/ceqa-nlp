21 allege as follows:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
22
1. Petitioner and Plaintiff West Coast Home Builders, Inc., a California
23

24 corporation ("WCHB"), is a property owner and taxpayer in the City of Brentwood ("City") in the

25 County of Contra Costa. WCHB is the owner and a developer of real property located in the City

26 and designated as assessor's parcel number 019-082-007 and portions of assessor's parcel

27 numbers 019-110-050 and 019-110-051 on the County of Contra Costa tax rolls comprising
(the "Property"). WCHB acquired the Property on or 28 approximately 140 acres within the City

MCH\99999\2227151.3 •]-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- about October 19, 1998 via grant deed from Meadow Creek Estates, Inc. Petitioner and Plaintiff

3 Discovery Builders, Inc., a California corporation ("DBI") is also a developer of the Property.
WCHB and DBI are referred to collectively as the "Petitioners."
2.

5 On or about June 12, 2017, Petitioners applied for various entitlements

6 required to develop a residential subdivision on part of the Property with both single family
homes, an apartment complex and approximately 20 acres for commercial known as the "Bridle
7 Gate" project ("Project"). On or about November 9, 2017, Petitioners submitted a supplemental
8 planning application for the Project. Petitioners' interest in lawful, orderly, consistent, timely, and
9 environmentally sound land use planning and development processing and approvals in the City
10 will be adversely affected if the City continues to violate the California Environmental Quality Act
11 ("CEQA"; Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.) by failing to timely complete and certify
12 an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. Petitioners are now, and will continue to
13 be, adversely affected by the City's unlawful and unwarranted delay in completing and certifying
14 an EIR for the Project, and are beneficially interested in the relief sought by this Petition and
15 Complaint.

16 3.

17 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the

18 City is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a municipal corporation duly organized and

19 existing under the laws of the State of California. The City is, and at all times herein mentioned
was, the lead agency responsible for carrying out and complying with the provisions of CEQA,
20 and the administrative regulations promulgated thereunder ("CEQA Guidelines"; Cal. Code Regs.,
21 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).

22 4. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of the parties
23 fictitiously sued herein as DOES through 20, and will amend this Petition and Complaint to set
24 forth their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioners are
25 informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that said fictitiously-named Respondents and
26 Defendants were the agents and employees of other fictitiously-named or actually-named
27 Respondents and Defendants, and acting within the scope of such agency and/or employment,
28 took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are the principals and took part in

MCH\99999\2227151.3 -2-
VERIFIRD PRTITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATR AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-named Respondents and Defendants

2 are liable to Petitioners for the relief prayed for herein.

3 5. On or about June 12, 2017, Petitioners submitted an application for various
4  entitlements required to develop the Project. Those entitlements include a General Plan
5 amendment, rezoning, vesting tentative map, and design review approvals. With the application
6 Petitioners also submitted a payment to the City of $145,845.87 consisting of processing costs

7 associated with the application.

8 6. In 2017 the City determined that the Project was subject to CEQA review.
9 On July 11, 2017 the City Council passed resolution 2017-100 authorizing Raney Planning &
10 Management, Inc. ("Raney") to prepare an initial study and mitigated negative declaration
11 ("IS/MND") pursuant to CEQA a for a budget of $105,449.00, plus a 25% City administration fee
12 for a total cost of $131,811.25.

13 7. In response to comments and feedback on the application from City staff,
14 | Petitioners submitted a supplemental planning application for the Project on or about November 9,
15 2017. At the same time Petitioners also paid the City an additional $26,362.25 for costs associated
16 with the preparation of the IS/MND.

17 8. On or about March 8, 2018, the City notified Petitioners that the Project
18 application was formally complete via a letter from Associate Planner Timothy a R. Nielsen.

19 9. On May 8, 2018 the City Council passed Resolution 2018-40 authorizing an
20 amendment of the contract with Raney in order to upgrade the IS/MND for the Project to an EIR,

21 and increasing the budget by $54,239.00. By that time Petitioners had already paid the City
22 $172,208.12 in application fees, including funds intended for the preparation of any documents
23 required by CEQA.

24 10. In March of 2019, a year after the Project application was deemed complete
25 and ten months after the City approved the preparation of an EIR for the Project, representatives of
26 Petitioners continued to request updates from the City as to the status of the processing of the
27 application and the preparation of the EIR. Specifically, Petitioners asked repeatedly for the status

28

II MCHN99999\2227151.3 -3-
VRRIFIED PRTTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATR AND COMPL.AINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

P of the City's preparation of a Notice of Preparation for the EIR and the public scoping meeting for

2 the same.

3 11. Following several months of discussion with the City on the subject,
4 Petitioners submitted an application for a development agreement with the City for the Project on

5 April 15, 2019. The proposed development agreement did not substantively change the Project,
6 but was intended only to vest Petitioners' rights to develop it pursuant to the already-complete
7 application so as to extend the life of the subdivision map to facilitate construction of the Project

8 in phases and commercial property.

9 12. On April 16, 2019, the City answered Petitioners' inquiries via an email
10| promising a substantive response within a week. On April 19, 2019, the City emailed an estimate
11 to Petitioner that the EIR process would be completed within approximately six months,
12 commencing with the release of the Notice of Preparation "shortly after[]" a meeting between the
13  parties scheduled for the week of April 22, 2019.

14 13. The City did not adhere to the time frame set forth in its April 19, 2019
15 email. The City issued a Notice of Preparation of the EIR on or about August 2, 2019, with a
16 review period ending on September 3, 2019. However, as of the date of this petition, the City has
17 failed to issue draft or administrative draft EIR for review or comment. In November of 2019,
18 after previously falsely representing to Petitioners that an administrative draft EIR had been
19 prepared for the Project by Raney, the City advised Petitioners that only an administrative draft of
20 the initial study - a preliminary study whose purpose is to determine whether : project may have
21 potentially significant impacts and whether a negative declaration or EIR should be prepared - had
22 been completed and had not yet been reviewed by the City.

23 14. Petitioners have made repeated inquiries of the City throughout 2019 and
24 early 2020 as to the status of the EIR for the Project. The City has either ignored or failed to
25 substantively or accurately respond to these inquiries, and has still not provided any date,
26 schedule, or time frame for the completion of the EIR for the Project. In January of 2020 a
27 representative from the City informed Petitioners that the City might prefer to delay processing the
28 Project until after the November 2020 election, which is almost ten months away as of the date of

11 MCH\99999\2227151.3 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- this Petition and Complaint (and more than two and a half years after the City deemed Petitioners'
2 application complete).

3 15.

4 Accordingly, more than twenty-two months after Petitioners' application

5 was deemed complete, and more than twenty months after the City authorized the preparation of

6 an EIR, the City has not released any draft EIR for the Project and have indicated to Petitioners'

7 attorney that it hasn't even been prepared. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that Public Resources
Code sections 21100.2(a) and 21151.5(a) require that a final EIR be completed and certified
8 within one year after the date on which the City deemed Petitioners' entitlement application
9 complete, an EIR has not yet been completed or certified for the Project.
10 16. This action is timely filed, and Petitioners have exhausted all administrative
11  remedies made available to them to the extent the same are not inadequate or futile. Petitioners
12 have further satisfied the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21177 prior to filing this
13 action. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this action.

14 17. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code
15 section 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to the City prior
16| to filing this Petition and Complaint. A true and correct copy of the notice provided pursuant
17 thereto, with proof of service thereof, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

18 18. Petitioners have complied with the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
19 section 388 and Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by mailing a copy of the Petition and
20 Complaint to the Attorney General of the State of California. A true and correct copy of

21 | Petitioners' covering Notice to Attorney General of the State of California is attached hereto as
22 Exhibit B.

23 19. Petitioners bring this action to vindicate their own legal rights as well as to
24 enforce important rights affecting the public as a private attorney general under Code of Civil

25 Procedure section 1021.5, and to redress arbitrary and capricious government action pursuant to
26 Government Code 800 and all applicable law.

MCH199999\2227151.3

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Writ of Mandate - Violations of CEQA)
3 20. Petitioners hereby incorporate herein by reference, as though set forth in
4 full, each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 19 above.
5 21. Public Resources Code section 21151.5 provides, in pertinent part, that the
6 City ".shall establish, by ordinance or resolution, time limits that do not exceed the following:
7 (A) One year for completing and certifying environmental impact reports..." (Pub. Resources
8 Code, § 21151.5, subd. (a)(1)(A).) As further set forth in Public Resources Code section 21151.5,
9 subdivision (a)(2), the statutorily mandated one-year time limit "shall be measured from the date
10 on which an application requesting approval of the project is received and accepted as complete by
11 the local agency."

12 22. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City
13 has not established, by ordinance or resolution, a one year time limit, or any other time limit, for
14 completing and certifying environmental impact reports.
15 23. Petitioners are further informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that
16 the City has not completed or certified an EIR for the Project, notwithstanding that the Project
17 entitlement application was received and accepted as complete on March 8, 2018 - almost two
18 years ago.
19 24. The City's failure to complete and certify an EIR for the Project constitutes
20| a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City has failed to proceed in the manner required by
21 law. In particular, the City has failed to comply with the provisions of Public Resources Code
22 section 21151.5 because the City has not established the statutorily mandated time limit requiring
23 completion and certification of environmental impact reports within one year, and has not
24 completed and certified an EIR for the Project, despite that the "application requesting approval of
25| the project" was "received and accepted as complete" by the City on March 8, 2018 - almost two
26 years ago.
27

28

| MCHN99999\2227151.3 -6-
VEDIFIED DETITION FOR WRIT OR MANDATR AND COMPI AINT FOR DRCLAR ATORY RRI.IRF

25. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course
2 of law, as shown by the representations in this verified petition, and traditional mandamus under
3 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 is the prescribed remedy for violations of this type.
4 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Declaratory Relief)

7 26. Petitioners hereby incorporate herein by reference, as though set forth in
8 full, each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 25 above.
9 27. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioners, on the
10 one hand, and the City, on the other hand, in that Petitioners contend, and are informed and
11 believe, and based thereon allege, that the City denies that it has failed to comply with CEQA, all
12 as set forth in more detail above.

13 28. It is necessary and appropriate at this time that the Court issue a declaratory
14 judgment so that all parties hereto and the public as a whole may know the illegality or the legality
15 of the actions of the City, as set forth in more detail above.

16 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
17 (1) For a writ of mandate directing, ordering and compelling the City to comply
18 with the procedural requirements and provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines by
19 immediately completing and certifying an EIR for the Project;

20 (2) For declaratory judgment that Respondent City's failure to complete and
21 certify an EIR within the statutorily-mandated one-year time period violates the provisions of

22 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

23 (3) For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5,
24 Government Code section 800, and all applicable law, and costs of suit incurred herein; and
