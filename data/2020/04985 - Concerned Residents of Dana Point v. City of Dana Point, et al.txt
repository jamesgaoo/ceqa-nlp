Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of Dana Point ("City" or

3 "Respondent") of a coastal development permit and a conditional use permit for a hotel project at

4 34482 Green Lantern in Dana Point, California ("Project"), and the related determination of an

5 exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

6 2. The City violated its General Plan, Dana Point Specific Plan, Local Coastal Program

7 ("LCP"), and Municipal Code in approving the Project. The Project is substantially inconsistent with

8 several important land use restrictions.

9 3. The City also violated CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among

10 other things, the City failed to adequately consider the environmental impacts associated with the

11 Project, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible

12 alternatives and mitigation.

13 4. The City also violated the Coastal Act in approving the Project,

14 5. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

15 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

21 members use, enjoy and benefit from the resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's

22 actions adversely affect the recreational, vocational, aesthetic, scientific, environmental and economic

23 interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members

12 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

13 12. The Project a site is a 17,737 square foot coastal bluff lot, located at 34482 Green Lantern in

14 the City of Dana Point. It is bordered by a Chart House restaurant to the east, Cove Road to the west,

15 undeveloped land to the north, and Dana Point Harbor to the south. Nearby is the Dana Point

16 Headlands, which includes the Dana Point Headlands Conversation Area.

17 13. The site is within the Coastal Development District of the Dana Point Specific Plan and

18 Local Coastal Program.

19 14. City staff represented the site is within the Coastal Visitor Commercial zoning designation

20 of the Dana Point Specific Plan.

21 15. The Project applicant sought approval of a Coastal Development Permit and Conditional

22 Use Permit from the City in order to develop a new 51-room hotel and associated facilities.

23 16. The building design includes five separate stories of habitable guest rooms, and a basement

24 level that is use for parking and other facilities.

25 17. The Project applicant sought administrative approval of a lot merger in order to merge two

26 lots.

27 18. The Project was presented to the City Planning Commission at its August 26, 2019 meeting.

28 City staff represented the Project should be processed in accordance with the Orange County Zoning

Concerned Residents of Dana Point v. City of Dana Point Page 3
Writ Petition

1 Code applicable in 1989 rather than the current Dana Point Municipal Code. Staff also represented that

2 the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15332, asserting "projects

3 that are consistent with the applicable general plan and zoning regulations, and that are less than five

4 acres and substantially surrounded by urban uses with no habitat value, and would result in no

5 significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air or water quality and can be served by all required

6 utilities and public services are categorically exempt from CEQA."

7 19. Petitioner, including in an August 26, 2019 letter, noted several problems with the Project

8 and the City's approach to the Project, including that the Project violates the General Plan, Dana Point

9 Specific Plan, LCP, and Municipal Code. Petitioner and others also noted the Project is not exempt

10 from CEQA and violates the Coastal Act. Petitioner and others also noted the proposed findings for the

11 Project were insufficient and could not be made.

12 20. Despite these concerns, the Planning Commission voted to approve the Project, including

13 approval of Coastal Development Permit CDP16-0014 and Conditional Use Permit CUP16-0005.

14 21. Petitioner filed a timely appeal of the Planning Commission's approvals.

15 22. The Project was presented to the City Council at its November 5, 2019 meeting. City staff

16 represented the Project should be processed in accordance with the Orange County Zoning Code

17 applicable in 1989 rather than the current Dana Point Municipal Code. Staff also represented that the

18 Project is exempt from CEQA.

19 23. Again, Petitioner, including in a November 1, 2019 letter, noted several problems with the

20 Project and the City's approach to the Project, including that the Project violates the General Plan,

21 Dana Point Specific Plan, LCP, and Municipal Code.

22 24. City staff claimed the City Council should ignore the City's General Plan and Municipal

23 Code, instead applying the 1989 Orange County Zoning Code. Petitioner's letter explained the

24 "General Plan makes clear the City did not intend a 30-year old code to regulate land use in the City."

25 The letter also noted the Municipal Code's and Specific Plan's provisions were more protective of

26 coastal and City resources, and explained that following such would result in a substantially lower

27 project. And Petitioner's letter noted that even if the Orange County Zoning Code applied to the

28 Project's coastal development permit, it would not apply to approval of a conditional use permit.

Concerned Residents of Dana Point v. City of Dana Point Page 4
Writ Petition

1 25. Petitioner's letter also noted the Project is not exempt from CEQA and violates the Coastal

2 Act. Petitioner's letter also noted the proposed findings for the Project were insufficient and could not

3 be made.

4 26. Despite these concerns, the City Council voted to approve the Project, including approval

5 of Coastal Development Permit CDP16-0014 and Conditional Use Permit CUP16-0005.

6 27. A Notice of Exemption was filed by the City on or after November 15, 2019.

7 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW 8

9 28. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

10 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

11 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

12 hearings.

13 29. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

14 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

15 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

16 30. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

17 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

18 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

19 31. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

20 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

21 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

22 32. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

23 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the MND. In the absence of

24 such remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will

25 suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the

26 Project.

Writ Petition

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATIONS OF GENERAL PLAN, SPECIFIC PLAN, LCP, AND MUNICIPAL CODE)

3 33. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if set
forth herein in full.

5 34. The Project violates numerous goals and policies of the City's General Plan, including goals

6 and policies found in the Urban Design Element, Land Use Element, Circulation Element, Noise Element,

7 and Coastal/Open Space Element. These include the following:

8 a. The Urban Design Element ("UDE") states that one policy and concept guiding

9 development of the Headlands is to: "Require all private development and public

10 improvement proposals which have potential to impact public views of the Headlands

11 and bluffs to submit detailed studies of view impacts. All development along the City's

12 coastline, as well as several locations in the Dana Point Town Center and Monarch

13 Beach areas, have potential to affect public views of the Headlands and bluffs." UDE-

14 16. (See also Dana Point Muni. Code § 9.05.170). The current information available

15 fails to adequately study and analyze potential view impacts of the Project by, among

16 other things, picking vantage points significantly higher than the public streets

17 immediately adjacent to the proposed Project site;

24 "Protect and preserve the public views of the Dana Point Harbor. (Coastal Visual

25 Resources/30251)"; indeed, the proposed Project will obstruct public views of the Dana

views from the Headlands site to the coastal areas and the harbor areas. (Coastal

6 Act/30251)";

7

8 g. Contrary to LUE Policy 5.2, the Project fails to: "Require geotechnical studies to

11 studies and adopted City regulations. (Coastal Act/30250, 30253)";

12 h. Contrary to LUE Policy 5.3, the Project fails to: "Preserve natural open space in the

13 Headlands area, especially along the coastal bluffs, and provide open areas integrated

14 throughout the development. (Coastal Act/30210- 212.5, 30250, 30253)";

i

15 Contrary to LUE Policy 5.4, the Project fails to: "Assure that the height and scale of the

16 development in the Headlands are compatible with the development in the community

17 and that the visual impact of the development from coastal areas below the project be
minimized. (Coastal Act/30251)";

18

19 j. Contrary to LUE Policy 5.5, the Project fails to: "Promote the development of a

20 mixture of land uses which may include residential, visitor-serving commercial,

21 recreational, open space, and community facilities. (Coastal Act/30213, 30250)";

22 k. Contrary to LUE Policy 5.6, the Project fails to: "Require that a scenic walkway be

23 extended throughout the Headlands and connect to other existing or proposed
walkways. (Coastal Act/30210-212)";

24 l.

25 Contrary to LUE Policy 5.7, the Project fails to: "Provide vehicular access that does not

26 adversely impact adjoining neighborhoods or create congestion on Pacific Coast
Highway";

27

28

Concerned Residents of Dana Point v. City of Dana Point
Writ Petition Page 7

1 m. The Project is inconsistent with LUE Policy 5.8 which requires that development:

2 "Provide patterns of land use and circulation in the Headlands that enhance public and

3 private pedestrian access and circulation within the area. (Coastal Act/30250)";

4 n. The Project is inconsistent with the required provision of public trails required by LUE

5 Policy 5.9;

22 9.05.170;

23 b. The Project fails to satisfy the required findings for a CDP pursuant to Code Section

10 failing to adequately comply with its own Zoning Code.

11 38. And to the extent City staff asserted the Project needed to comply with Orange County

12 Zoning Code requirements, the Project violated numerous Orange County Zoning Code requirements,

13 including provisions related to off-street parking and development standards.
