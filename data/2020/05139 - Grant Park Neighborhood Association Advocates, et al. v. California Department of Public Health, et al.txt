Step Actión

Declaration regarding notice, as specifled in rule 3.1204,
In addition, CCP § 1094.5 (g) and (h) require that proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent accompany an application for a stay. See subdivisions (g) and (h) for required manner of service.

2. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an ex parte hearing date and time and to determine whether the assigned writ department requires any of the documents or papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing. Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

3. Notify respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the hearing on the ex parte stay application In accordance with rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include the details of
this notification in the declaration regarding notice prepared pursuant to rule 3.1204.
Note: The court prefers at least 48 hours" notice but, upon a showing of urgency, wIll accept less notice.

4. If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents Iisted above in Step 1 to be flled before the ex parte hearing, flle and serve the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing. (See rule 3.1206 of the Callfornia Rules of Court).

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 4 of 11

At the ex parte hearing, depending on the nature of the factual and legal issues raised by the stay application and the practical exigencies of the matter, the court will elther rule on the stay application immediately or issue the proposed OSC with or without a temporary stay order pending the hearing on the OSC at a specified date and time.
If the court grants a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court will sign and file the proposed stay order and set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The courf clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the
petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, In the alternative writ,

If the court denies a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court, upon
petitioner's request, will set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the petition, or if the court has ordered the Issuance of an alternative writ, In the alternative writ.

Applying for a Temporary Stay in Traditional Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1085):
Step Action

1. Follow the statutory and regulatory provisions for obtaining a temporary restralning order (TRO), an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued (OSC), and/or a preliminary Injunction, set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure
(including but not limited to CCP §§ 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529) and rule 3.1150 of the California Rules of Court. These provisions constitute rules of practice for temporary stays in mandate proceedings brought under CCP § 1085 in the absence of temporary stay provisions spocific to such mandate proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

2. When following the statutory and regulatory procedures for obtaining a TRO and/or an oSC, comply with the ex parte procedures outlined above in "Applying for a Temporary Stay in Administrative Mandate Proceedings" and in rule 3.1201 et seq. of the California Rules of Court.

3. If no TRO or OSC is sought, notice a motion for a preliminary injunction following the procedures set forth below In "Bringing Motions Before the Hearing on the Merits"

Note that a temporary stay in proceedings on a petition for a writ of prohibition may be
obtained by following the procedures set forth below under "Setting ) Hearing on the Merits of a Petition, (2) Securing Issuance of alternative writ." An alternative writ of prohibition, unlike an altornative writ of mandate, stays specified action by the respondent until further order of the court. (See CCP SS 1087, 1104.)

Bringing Motions before
The Hearing on the
Merits of a Writ Petition:

Motions on the pleadings and other pretrial matters brought in civil actions -- including motions for change of venue, demurters, motions to strike, motions to dismiss, discovery motions, and motions for summary judgment - may generally be brought in writ
proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Potitions for Prerogative Writs

Reviaed 1.1.2014 Page 5 of 11

Motions addressing the merits of the petition in whole or in part should be calendared for a hearing at the same time as the hearing on the merlts. Motions directed at resolving issues preliminary to and distinct from the issues related to the merits of the petition, such
as untimeliness of the petition under an applicable statute of limitations, should be calendared before the hearing on the merits of a writ petition. The court, in the exercise of Its discretion to control the order of litigation before it, may advance the hearing on a motion to a date before the hearing on the merits or may postpone a motion to the hearing on the merlts when such advancement or postponement will promote the efficient conduct and dispositlon of the proceeding.

Because a writ petltion Is usually disposed of by a hearing on the merlts which is limlted to oral
argument on written briefs and dooumentary evidence, the usefulness of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication in economically disposing of an unmerltorlous
case or claim is substantially reduced in writ proceedings. Thus, before bringing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, counsel should carefully evaluate whether the purpose of the motion can be achleved more directly and completely through a hearing on the merits af the petition.

Step Action

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve a date and time available on the department's calendar for a hearing on the motion. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availabllity on the date. Some assigned wrlt departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

2. Notice the motion In accordance with the civil law and motion procedures in
CCP § 1005 and in compliance with the California Rules of Court, Including rules 3.1110 through 3.1113, 3.1115, 3.1116, 3.1300, and 3,1320 through 3.1324. Comply with the page limits for memoranda set forth in rule 3.1113.
If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the notice of motion must contain tentative ruling language avallable from the department,

Setting a Hearing on the Merits of a
Writ Petitlon:

If a hearing on the merits of a writ petition has not been set in conjunction with an ex parte hearing on an application for : temporary stay, It may be set either by (1) noticing a hearing on the petition or (2) securing issuance of an alternative writ. Note: The court prefers, as more efficient and economical for both itself and the parties, the procedure of noticing a hearing on the petition,
The date set for a hearing on the merits of a writ petition, whether by notice or alternative writ, should allow the parties to file briefs In accordance with the following schedule established
