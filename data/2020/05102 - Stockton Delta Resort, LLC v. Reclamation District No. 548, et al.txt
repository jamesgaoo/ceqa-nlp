20 INTRODUCTION

21 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff STOCKTON DELTA RESORT, LLC (*Petitioner") brings

22 this action under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub. Resources Code,

23 § 21000 et seq.) challenging decisions of Respondents RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO, 548

24 and the BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO. 548 (collectively the

25 "District"), as the CEQA lead agency, to adopt a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") improperly

26 approved by the District's Engineer, as the basis for the District's long-delayed approval of a

27 long-term physical rehabilitation effort consisting of the Levee Repair Project on the Terminous

28 Tract between levee station 531+00 to 583+00 (the "Project"). As described by the District in a -1- STOBL RIVES LLP

108186097.6 0058258-00004

1 September 10, 2020 Notice to Contractors, the Project includes "clearing and grubbing, tree

2 removal, demolition, 45,000 ton import fill, Class 2 aggregate base, quarry stone slope protection,

3 HDPE utility sleeves, chip seal and other associated works." The fill material alone equates to 90

4 million pounds of earthen material that will be brought to the site by heavy duty diesel trucks,

5 entering, unloading, and exiting in the midst of Petitioner's longstanding marina, resort, and

6 residential village property, This massive volume of material does not even include the additional

7 aggregate base and quarry stone slope protection. The Project, which has languished for years

8 under District administration and has never been addressed with any level of urgency, has

9 multiple potentially significant impacts on the environment in direct violation of CEQA, as well

10 as adverse consequences on Petitioner's existing recreational and residential business operations

11 that depend upon the natural environment and resources on the Project site and in the vicinity,

12 2. Petitioner, therefore, would be negatively and substantially affected by the

13 Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, as well as the District's procedural violations

14 and improper approvals.

15 3. Petitioner brings this action to compel the District to conduct environmental

16 review in full compliance with CEQA before implementing the Project. Petitioner seeks a

17 peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or 1094.5

18 setting aside the District's approvals and ordering the District to comply with its obligations

19 under CEQA.

20 4. The District's approval of and reliance on the NOE violates CEQA because the

21 District failed to meaningfully consider and evaluate the Project's potentially significant

22 environmental effects.

23 5. Because the District failed to proceed in the manner required by law, prejudicially

24 abused its discretion, and violated CEQA when it approved and relied upon an unlawful NOE,

25 Petitioner asks this Court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the District to: (1) set

26 aside findings authorizing the filing of the NOE with the County of San Joaquin; (2) set aside any

27 Project approvals, and related District actions dependent upon the NOE; and (3) order an

28 injunction preventing implementation of the Project and related District actions dependent upon

1 the NOE until the District has fully complied with CEQA.

2 PARTIES

0O T 6. Petitioner STOCKTON DELTA RESORT, LLC is, at all times mentioned herein,
a California limited liability company, organized and existing under the laws of the State of

5 California. Petitioner's main office is located in Lodi, California.

6 7. Respondent RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO. 548 is, at all times mentioned

7 herein, a California public agency formed under the Reclamation District Law of 1868 for the

8 purpose of maintenance, protection, or repair of its reclamation works, including levees, dredger

9 cuts, borrow pits, canals, ditches, pumping plants, gates, fences, and other works. The District is

10 responsible for maintaining the Terminous Tract levees. The Terminous Tract is comprised of

11 approximately 10,288 acres of land within the San Joaquin Delta.

12 8. Respondent BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO. 548

13 is a three-member elected body charged with governing RECLAMATION DISTRICT NO. 548.

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 9. This Court has jurisdiction to review Respondents' findings, approvals, and

16 actions and issue a writ of mandate and/or injunctive relief, as well as other appropriate relief

17 sought herein, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq., 1060, 1085, and 1094.5

18 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

19 10. Venue for this action properly lies in the San Joaquin County Superior Court under

20 Code of Civil Procedure section 394 (actions against a city, county, or local agency) and section

21 395 (actions generally) because the Respondents are local agencies of the State of California.

22 Venue is also proper in this Court because Project activities will occur within the County of San

23 Joaquin, and the environmental impacts will occur within the County. The causes of action

24 alleged in this petition arise in this County. (Code Civ. Proc., § 393.)

25 11. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

26 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action on September

27 29, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

28 12. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section -3- STOEL RIVES LLP
TTORNEYS A VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND SACRAMENTO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
108186097.6 0058258-00004

1 21167.6(a) by concurrently filing a Notice of Election to Prepare the Record of Proceedings

2 relating to this action.

3 13. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

4 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on September 30,

5 2020. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 14. Public Resources Code section 21177(a) provides that an action cannot be

8 brought under CEQA unless the alleged grounds for noncompliance with CEQA were presented

9 to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period or

10 before the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of

11 determination. This exhaustion requirement has been applied generally to an agency's use of

12 categorical exemptions. (Tomlinson v. County of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal.App.4th 281, 290.) In

13 situations, however, in which the agency determines that a project is categorically exempt from

14 CEQA compliance, but holds no public hearing on the exemption, the exhaustion requirements do

15 not apply. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (e).) Simply stated, Petitioner and members of

16 the public were unable to raise objections before the lead agency prior to execution of the NOE

17 by the District's contract engineer.

18 15. The exhaustion requirement also does not apply when a project description is

19 misleading, incomplete, or otherwise fails to fully inform the public about the nature and extent of

20 the project. (See generally, McQueen v. Board of Dirs. (1988) 202 CA3d 1136; Save the Plastic

21 Bag Coalition v. County of Marin (2013) 218 CA4th 209.) The project description included in

22 the NOE states merely, "The project consists of adding fill to the levee crown." This threadbare

23 project description is wholly inadequate and further eliminates any potential exhaustion

24 requirement for the District's much broader massive levee reconstruction effort. Even if

25 Petitioner and members of the public had somehow managed to obtain and review a copy of the

26 proposed exemption, they were misled by a deceptively small and benign project description

27 intended to downplay the need for environmental review.

28 16. Even though Petitioner was not legally required to present its objections to the

SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
108186097.6 0058258-00004

1 District, Petitioner has periodically communicated with and appeared before the District

2 regarding concerns about the Project, including a letter to the District on August 27, 2019

3 outlining the basis for certain objections to the District's use of categorical exemptions for the

4 Project. Since then, Petitioner has been in regular contact with District staff, counsel, consultants,

5 and Board of Trustees regarding the Project.

6 STANDING

7 17. As described above, Petitioner is beneficially interested in the subject matter of

8 this proceeding because implementation of the Project will have substantial impacts on

9 Petitioner's and the public's use and enjoyment of the natural environment, as well as Petitioner's

10 use and enjoyment of its own property and business operations. In addition, Petitioner's

11 residents, customers, and visitors will be directly injured by the District's failure to comply with

12 CEQA in connection with the Project, as Petitioner's operations will be impacted by significant

13 environmental effects that have not been adequately identified, disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated.

14 18. Petitioner has standing in the public interest because this case involves public

15 rights and enforcement of public duties. As the lead agency, the District has a mandatory a duty to

16 comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA. Petitioner is not seeking

17 relief greater than or different from relief otherwise sought on behalf of the general public. If

18 successful, this action would enforce the mandates of CEQA, including the public's right to

19 adequate and informative environmental review under that statute.

20 19. On August 29, 2019, in order to avert anticipated litigation, Petitioner and

21 Respondents executed a Time Defense Tolling Agreement (the "Tolling Agreement") tolling the

22 statutes of limitations, including California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15062(d),

23 equitable defenses of laches and all other time-related bars that may be applicable to any action,

24 claim, or defense brought by Petitioner against the District arising out of the District's filing of
25 the NOE for the Project. (Exhibit C.) The purpose of the Tolling Agreement was to allow the

26 parties sufficient time to discuss options for the Project that might not have significant impacts

27 upon the environment, including the use and enjoyment of the environment by Petitioner's

28 residents, customers, and guests, as well as the public. The Tolling Agreement has been extended

1 through several addendums, the most recent of which extends the tolling period through

2 September 30, 2020.

3 ATTORNEYS' FEES

20. In seeking to compel the District to lawfully discharge its mandatory public duties,
Petitioner is acting in its capacity as private attorney general in the interest and for the benefit of

6 the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal

7 theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in

8 this Petition will constitute a significant public benefit by requiring the District to carry out its

9 duties as lead agency under CEQA in compliance with the law.

10 21. Further, Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among other things, that the

11 District's actions in connection with the Project were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious.

12 Pursuant to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioners are entitled to

13 reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this action to redress the District's arbitrary and capricious

14 actions.

15 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW - STAY AND INJUNCTION

16 22. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public

17 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court may stay or enjoin operation of any

18 administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding.

19 23. Because the District, as lead agency under CEQA, has after at least seven years of

20 delay, approved the Project, and because of various statements regarding the anticipated timing of

21 Project implementation by District representatives, there is real and present threat that the

22 District will finally proceed to construct and implement the Project despite the complete absence

23 of environmental review under CEQA, including a complete assessment of the impacts of those

24 actions, and thereby cause irreparable and irreversible harm to the environment. Given the

25 District's violations of CEQA by approving the Project based on an unlawful NOE, any action to

26 construct the Project is null and void. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law

27 for the irreparable harm that would result from the District's construction of the Project. A stay

28 or preliminary injunction is necessary to restrain the District from taking additional actions to

1 construct the Project until it has lawfully complied with CEQA.

2 24. A stay or injunction of the District's actions related to the Project would not be

3 against the public interest because: (1) the District is required by law to conduct adequate
4 environmental review of the Project prior to approval; (2) construction of the Project would likely

5 have significant impacts on the environment; (3) the District has inexplicably delayed

6 implementation of the Project for years, which alone is evidence of the

7 District's lack of immediacy; and (4) neither the District nor the public will be harmed by a stay

8 or injunction sufficient to enable the proper conduct of environmental review.
9 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10 25. More than seven years ago, on September 12, 2013, the District's Board of

11 Trustees approved a resolution entitled Hazard Mitigation Plan Levee Repair and Improvement

12 Projects Special Project Funding Agreement, TR-12-1.0 ("2013 Resolution") determining that the

13 then identified project was exempt from CEQA under California Code of Regulations, title 14,

14 sections 15301 and 15302. The 2013 Resolution further authorized the District's Engineer,

15 Dominick Gulli, or District's Secretary, Dante John Nomellini, Jr., to prepare and file with the

16 County of San Joaquin a then-current NOE. Finally, the resolution authorized the President or

17 Secretary of the District to execute the Project Funding Agreement for the Construction of

18 District Levee Repair Project on Terminous Tract, Agreement No. TR-12-1.0.

19 26. In May 2018, Synthesis Planning prepared for the District a Baseline Biological

20 Resources Assessment for the Terminous Tract Levee Upgrade Project (*Biological

21 Assessment"). This limited Biological Assessment identified potential Project impacts to special-

22 status plant species, bat species, nesting avian species, and reptiles. The Biological Assessment

23 also identified environmental mitigation measures cloaked as "avoidance measures" to be

24 implemented during Project construction and implementation. The Biological Assessment

25 indicates these measures are intended "to avoid impacts to special-status wildlife and plant

26 species, as well as sensitive plant communities." (Biological Assessment p. 20.) These extensive

27 mitigation measures include conducting pre-construction surveys for special-status plant species,

28 the western red bat, nesting special-status avian species, the western pond turtle, and giant garter

1 snakes. (Biological Assessment pp. 21-25.) The Biological Assessment determines that the

2 "implementation of avoidance measures stated in Section 6.0 of this assessment will assure

3 protection of sensitive habitat and species and the maintenance of biological functions and
4 values" and "will avoid all impacts the proposed project could have on any special-status

5 species." (Biological Assessment p. 25.)

6 27. On July 26, 2019, Dominick Gulli, District Engineer, filed a NOE for the updated

7 Project, which includes "cleaning and grubbing, tree removal, demolition, 45,000 ton import fill,

8 Class 2 aggregate base, quarry stone slope projection, HDPE utility sleeves, chip seal and other

9 associated works" with the County of San Joaquin. The NOE, which by law notifies the public of

10 the agency's conclusion regarding the applicability of CEQA, states that the Project is exempt

11 from CEQA review under the Class 1 and 2 Categorical Exemptions. The explanation provided

12 in the NOE states that the Project's "work is repair of existing public facilities involving no

13 expansion of use….and reconstruction of existing facilities located on the same site and the

14 facilities will have the same purposes and capacity." (NOE p. 1.)

15 28. The District did not convene a noticed public hearing on the decision to adopt the

16 NOE, or take testimony from Petitioner or others relating to the NOE executed on July 26, 2019.

17 29. On July 30, 2019, the District published its Terminous Tract Project Funding

18 Agreement (PFA) TR-12-1.0 Scope of Work (SOW). The SOW, prepared by District Engineer

19 Dominick Gullli, provides a very basic summary of the existing levee conditions and the Project's
20 work areas. All told, the description of work contained in the SOW consists of five paragraphs
21 over a mere 1.5 pages. Petitioner has sought additional documentation regarding additional
22 actions and activities by Respondents via requests filed under the California Public Records Act
23 (California Government Code section 6250 et seq.), however, Petitioner is still awaiting
24 production of responsive materials, some or all of which may further illuminate the history of the
25 Project and associated actions by the District in violation of CEQA.
26 30. On September 10, the District issued a Notice to Contractors regarding bidding for
27 the Project. The Notice to Contractors describes the Project as "Clearing and Grubbing, Tree

28 removal, demolition, 45,000 ton import fill, Class 2 aggregate base, quarry stone slope protection,

1 HDPE utility sleeve, chip seal and other associated works."

2 31. On September 15, 2020, the District held a job walk at on Petitioner's property,

3 ostensibly relating to the Project site and thereafter opened bidding for construction of the Project.

4 32. On September 29, 2020, the bids were scheduled to be opened and read.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondents - Respondents Relied on Inapplicable

8 Categorical Exemptions)

9 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set

10 forth above.

11 34. When a proposed project approved by a public agency may have a significant,

12 adverse effect on the environment, CEQA requires that detailed information be provided to the

13 agency and to the public regarding the proposed project's likely environmental effects. (Cal. Pub.

14 Resources Code, § 21601.) CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines (codified at California Code of

15 Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq.) have established a three-tiered process to ensure that

16 public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations. The first tier is

17 jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review to determine whether CEQA

18 applies to a proposed activity. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106,

19 113.) If an agency finds that the proposed project is exempt from CEQA, no further review is

20 necessary, and the agency may prepare a notice of exemption. (Ibid.) If the project does not fall

21 within any exemption, the agency must conduct an initial study. If the initial study demonstrates

22 that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare a

23 negative declaration. If the initial study demonstrates that the project may have a significant

24 effect on the environment, the agency must prepare a full environmental impact report. (Ibid.)

25 35. Here, with respect to the first tier, the District erroneously determined in 2019 that

26 the Project was subject to categorical exemptions and thus not subject to CEQA review.

27 36. While categorical exemptions are generally suggestive of categories of activities

28 that will not adversely impact the environment, they are not absolute. Specifically, a categorical

STOBL RIVES LLP -9-

ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND SACKAMENTO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
108186097.6 0058258-00004

1 exemption may not be used for a project "where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

2 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (14 Cal. Code

3 § Regs., § 15300.2, subd (c).) In this case, the Project's sheer scope and sensitive location

4 constitute unusual circumstances, such that categorical exemptions are inapplicable.

5 37. CEQA Guidelines section 15301 creates an exemption for the repair, maintenance,

6 or minor alteration of existing facilities. Generally, projects that fall under this exemption

7 involve work in the footprint of the existing area. (See Erven v. Board of Supervisors (1973) 53

8 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1013-1014.) This exemption is inapplicable to the Project. Although the NOE

9 states that the Project involves "no expansion of use," among other contradictions, the Statement

10 of Work clearly indicates that the levee will be both widened and raised.

11 38. Further, the Project is it unusual because it involves sensitive waterway area work,

12 requiring "placement of rip rap above the ordinary high water line and the restoration of the

13 waterside of the seawall." (Statement of Work, 8.) A few of the activities listed in Section 15301

14 involve work in or around waterways, but these do not present a risk of erosion, and are minor

15 compared to the scope of the Project. A separate exemption exists for minor alterations to land,

16 and although it hasn't been claimed by the District, it is instructive here. The CEQA Guidelines'

17 treatment of "minor alternations to land" (Guidelines §15304, subd. (d)) indicates that grading in

18 a waterway should not be treated as a minor change.

19 39. The Project is similarly not covered by the categorical exemption contained in

20 Section 15302, which exempts activities including the replacement or reconstruction of existing

21 structures and facilities. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15302.) Unlike the project types legitimately

22 covered by Section 15302, the Project does not involve replacement or reconstruction of a single

23 "commercial structure" or 'existing utility systems" (CEQA Guidelines, § 15302, subds. (b),

24 (c)), but as described above, is far more extensive.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondents - Failure to Consider Project's Significant

27 Impacts)

28 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set
STOEL RIVES LLP -10-

ATTORNEYS AT LAW
SACRAMENTO VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
108186097.6 0058258-00004

1 forth above.

2 41. The District's decision to file a NOE for the Project was improper and unsupported

3 by substantial evidence. By approving a NOE, the District failed to adequately consider or

4 acknowledge the numerous biological and other impacts of the Project.

5 42. The Project will result in significant impacts to biological resources that were not

6 appropriately analyzed by the District. Though a Biological Assessment was prepared, because

7 the Project was deemed exempt from CEQA none of the information and analysis of impacts in

8 the Biological Assessment was ever considered in an environmental document subject to public

9 review and input. In fact, to the extent it was reviewed at all, the Biological Assessment was

10 cavalierly dismissed by a contract engineer for the District, who in theory relied upon six year old

11 threadbare findings to support the NOE he executed outside of public view. Because the

12 mandatory findings called for on the face of the NOE (and included in the 2013 Resolution)

13 predated the Biological Assessment by years, those findings necessarily lacked evidence relating

14 to biological impacts, and are themselves invalid.

15 43. Among other shortcomings, the District failed to properly consider the removal of

16 at least fifty mature trees (Scope of Work, at 9) and an array of construction impacts to common

17 vegetative communities and wildlife habitats, common wildlife and plant species, and special-

18 status plants and animals. The Biological Assessment identified a number of potential Project

19 impacts to special-status plants (big tarplant, diamond-petalled poppy, woolly-rose mallow, eel-

20 grass pondweed, marsh skullcap, side-flowering skullcap, and caper-fruited tropidocarpum),

21 special-status bat species (western red bat), special-status avian species (tri-colored blackbird,

22 western burrowing owl, Swainson's hawk, white-tailed kite, California black rail, song sparrow

23 (Modesto population)), migratory avian species, and other raptor species, and special-status

24 reptiles (northwestern pond turtle and giant garter snake). (Biological Assessment, p. 19-20.)

25 Any project that substantially reduces the habitat of a wildlife species, or reduces the number or

26 range of an endangered, rare or threatened species, is deemed to have a significant impact on the

27 environment as a matter of law. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15605.)

28 44. In an attempt to surreptitiously mitigate the Project's many potentially significant

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 biological impacts, the Biological Assessment included a host of so-called "avoidance measures",

2 that are in all legal respects mitigation measures in cloaked terminology, thereby enabling the

3 District to claim the absence of impacts and to avoid environmental review. The inclusion of

4 these measures throughout the Biological Assessment demonstrates that the Project actually will

5 have substantial impacts on the environment, and that preparation of an initial study was required,

6 as further demonstrated in the Third Cause of Action. The measures include pre-construction

7 surveys for the following special-status plants and animals:

8 a. Big tarplant;
9 b. Diamond-petalled poppy;
10 C. Woolly-rose mallow;

11 d. Eel-grass pondweed;

12 e. Marsh skullcap;

13 f. Side-flowering skullcap;

14 g. Caper-fruited tropidocarpum;

15 h. Western red bat;

16 i. Raptors and migratory birds;

17 •- Western burrowing owl;

18 k. Swainson's hawk; and

19 1. Giant garter snake.

20 43. The District's failure to complete the mandatory pre-construction surveys

21 identified by the District's own biological consultant necessarily precludes any project activities

22 and exposes the District's cavalier approach towards CEQA.

23 45. The District also failed to analyze the numerous significant environmental effects

24 related to Project construction. These temporary effects include, but are not limited to noise, air

25 quality, and traffic impacts.

26 46. The Project will result in significant noise impacts that were not analyzed by the

27 District. Noise-sensitive land uses, including residential uses, are within approximately 213 feet

28 (calculated via Google Earth measurement) of the Project area. Construction activities required -12- STOEL RIVES LLP
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND SACRAMENTO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for Project implementation, including but not limited to the transport, unloading, and deposit of

2 more than 45,000 tons of construction material, would generate significant noise impacts to

3 susceptible noise-sensitive locations for the duration of construction. These noise impacts could

4 also have significant impacts on biological resources and species at the Project site, none of

5 which have been studied by the District, or even considered prior to the District Engineer's

6 execution of the NOE. Because an initial study has not been prepared and the Project description

7 is impossible to definitively pin down, Petitioners do not have information regarding the exact

8 construction equipment needed for the Project; however, Petitioner expects that equipment will

9 necessarily include excavators, backhoes, bulldozers, scrapers, rollers, graders, loaders,

10 compactors, heavy-duty trucks, and other noise producing equipment.

11 47. The Project will result in significant local and regional air quality impacts related

12 to construction that were not analyzed by the District. Project construction will require site

13 preparation and excavation, and extensive use of gas and diesel equipment, that will result in

14 fugitive dust emissions and emissions of criteria and hazardous air pollutants. The District has

15 further failed to indicate whether any air permits are necessary for the construction efforts, or
16 identify the appropriate regulatory agencies

17 48. The Project will result in significant transportation and traffic impacts that were

18 never analyzed by the District. The Project will displace a significant amount of commercial

19 parking. Although the direct loss of parking itself is not an impact that is required to be

20 considered under CEQA section 21099, the District must consider all potentially significant

21 environmental effects indirectly associated with permanent parking displacement, including

22 increased area traffic and circulation due to fewer available spaces (CEQA Guidelines §15064,

23 subd. (d) (indirect physical changes in the environment)), and increased vehicular emissions, and

24 noise associated with increased vehicle circulation, as well as associated safety and emergency

25 evacuation impacts. (See Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21099, subd. (b)(3); Covina Residents for

26 Responsible Development v. City of Covina (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 712, 728.) The consequences

27 of lost parking and accessway reconfiguration will result in more permanent congestion and

28 traffic, and related safety and emergency evacuation impacts. All of these factors remain wholly

1 unaddressed by the District. Evaluation of this impact is especially important given the

2 residential aspect of Petitioner's business operations, and the prevalence of large campers and tow

3 vehicles.

4 49. The Project will result in significant impacts to agriculture that were never

5 analyzed by the District. Because the Project will displace permanent parking and significantly

6 constrain site access, Petitioner will be required to locate alternative parking and/or shuttle

7 operations on adjacent agricultural areas, thereby displacing agricultural operations and

8 significantly impacting the environment. (CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G, §II.)
9 50. None of the Project's significant impacts on the environment described above were

10 identified or analyzed by the District as part of the District's CEQA review process. Because the

11 Project will result in significant impacts to the environment, Respondents' reliance on categorical

12 exemptions is improper, and an initial study must be prepared.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondents - Improper Incorporation of Mitigation

15 Measures in Biological Assessment)

16 51. Petitioner realleges an incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

17 above.

18 52. In an effort avoid acknowledging the many potentially significant impacts to

19 special-status plant and animal species identified in the Biological Assessment, the Biological

20 Assessment incorporates active mitigation to be implemented at various points prior to and during

21 Project construction. Instead of calling these obvious mitigation measures by their rightful name,

22 the Biological Assessment attempts disguise the measures by applying the label "avoidance

23 measures." These measures include:

24 d. A qualified botanist will conduct pre-construction field survey to identify

25 any populations of seven targeted special-status plants within areas of non-

26 native grassland and freshwater emergent marsh that will be disturbed

27 during project activities. These surveys shall be conducted prior to the

28 initiation of any construction activities and coincide with the appropriate

1 flowering period of the special-status plant species with the potential to

2 occur in the Project area. These plant species are the big tarplant,

3 diamond-petalled poppy, woolly rose-mallow, eel-grass pondweed, marsh
4 skullcap, side-flowering skullcap, and caper-fruited tropidocarpum.
4o (Biological Assessment, p. 21.) If a special-status plant population is
found within the proposed disturbance zone, the District will consult with
7 CDFW and USFWS to determine the appropriate measures to avoid or

8 mitigate for impacts to the species or population.
9 b. To prevent impacts to western red bats, where tree removal is necessary on
10 the project site or where trees are within 200 feet of any construction areas,

on 11 and to prevent direct mortality of western red bats roosting in the trees
12 the project site, a bat habitat assessment must be conducted by a qualified

13 bat biologist that should be conducted 3 to 6 months prior to tree removal.

14 Tree removal must only occur during seasonal periods of bat activity,

15 between March 1, or when evening temperatures are above 45F and rainfall

16 less than ½'º in 24 hours occurs, and April 15, prior to parturition of pups.
17 The next acceptable period for tree removal with suitable roosting habitat is

18 after pups become sufficiently volant - September 1 through about October

19 15, or prior to evening temperatures dropping below 45F and onset of

20 rainfall fretter than ½/2" in 24 hours. (Biological Assessment, p. 22.)

21 C. In order to avoid protected raptors and migratory birds, between February

22 and August 31, prior to construction activities, an initial pre-construction

23 raptor nest survey shall be conducted within 15 days prior to the beginning

24 of construction activities by a CDFW-approved biologist in order to

25 identify active nests in the project site vicinity. The results of the survey

26 shall be submitted to CDFW for review prior to beginning construction.

o uAON avian and raptor species in the Project sites and buffer areas. Pre-
construction surveys shall occur prior to the proposed Project
implementation, and during the appropriate survey periods for nesting
activities. Surveys will follow required CDFW and USFWS protocols,
where applicable. A qualified biologist will survey suitable habitat for the

7 presence of these species. If a migratory avian species is observed and

8 suspected to be nesting, a 250-foot buffer area will be established to avoid

9 impacts to the active nest. If active nesting sites are found, the following

10 exclusion buffers will be established, and no project activities will occur

11 within these buffer zones until young birds have fledged. (Biological
Assessment, p. 22.)

12 e.

13 If ground disturbing activities occur during breeding season (February

14 through mid-September), surveys for active nests will be conducted by a

15 qualified biologist no more than 10 days prior to start of activities.

16 Minimum no disturbance of 250 feet around active nest of non-listed bird

17 species and 250 foot no disturbance buffer around migratory birds; and 0.5-

18 mile no disturbance buffer from listed species and fully protected species

19 until breeding season has ended or until a qualified biologist has

20 determined that the birds have fledged and are no longer reliant upon the

21 nest or parental care for survival. (Biological Assessment, p. 22.)

f.

22 In the case of the Western Burrowing Owl, for construction areas

23 containing suitable habitat, and in conformance with federal and state

24 regulations regarding the protection of raptors, a preconstruction survey for

25 burrowing owls will be completed within a 500-meter buffer around the

26 construction site, in conformance with CDFW guidelines, and prior to the

27 start of construction. Surveys shall be conducted during the non-breeding

28 season, but as close as possible to the date that ground disturbing activities

STOEL RIVES LLP

1 to ground-disturbing activities. The time lapse between surveys and site

2 disturbance should not exceed seven (7) days. If breeding or resident owls

3 are located on or immediately adjacent to the site, the following measures

4 will be implemented:

5 g. The burrowing owl nesting season begins as early as February 1 and
6 continues through August 31. If burrowing owls are located or become

7 established within the proposed project sites or buffer areas at the time of

8 the final pre-activity biological survey and are using burrows within the

9 proposed Project sites or buffer areas, a qualified biologist will consult
10 with CDFW; the following measures shall be implemented:
11 i. Recommendations included in CDFW's Staff Report on Burrowing
12 Owl Mitigation (CDFG 2012a) shall be followed including

13 avoidance of occupied burrows by implementation of a buffer zone

14 of a minimum distance of 500 meters, unless a qualified biologist

15 approved by CDFW verifies through non-invasive methods that

16 either: 1) the birds have not begun egg laying and incubation; or 2)

17 that juveniles from the occupied burrows are foraging

18 independently and are capable of independent survival. (Biological

19 Assessment, p. 23.)

20 11. On-site passive relocation of burrowing owls should be

21 implemented if owls are using the burrows after August 31.

22 Passive relocation is defined as encouraging owls to move from

23 occupied burrows to alternate natural or artificial burrows that are

24 beyond 150 feet from the impact zone and that are within or

25 contiguous to a minimum of 6.5 acres of foraging habitat for each

26 pair of relocated owls. Relocation of owls should only be

27 implemented during the non-breeding season. Eviction outside the

28 nesting season may be permitted pending evaluation of eviction

- (co• plans and receipt of formal written approval from the CDFW
authorizing the eviction. (Biological Assessment, p. 23.)

iii. Owls should be excluded from burrows in the immediate impact
zone and within 150 feet buffer zone by installing one-way doors in
burrow entrances. One-way doors should be left in place 48 hours
to insure owls have left the burrow before excavation. One

7 alternate natural or artificial burrow should be provided for each

8 burrow that will be excavated in the project impact zone. The
9 project area should be monitored daily for one week to confirm owl

10 use of alternate burrows before excavating burrows in the

11 immediate zone. (Biological Assessment, p. 23.)

12 iv. Whenever possible, burrows should be excavated using hand tools

13 are refilled to prevent reoccupation [sic]. Sections of flexible

14 plastic pipe or burlap bags should be inserted into burrow tunnels to

15 prevent tunnel collapse while soil is excavated around that portion

16 of a tunnel. (Biological Assessment, p. 23.)

17 V. If accidental take (disturbance, injury, or death of owls) occurs, the

18 DFG would be notified immediately. (Biological Assessment, p.

19 24.)

20 V1. If a preconstruction survey finds that burrowing owls occupy a

21 portion of the Project site, this area will be avoided by project

22 construction activities, and the buffer areas described previously

23 will be implemented to avoid impacts to this species. (Biological

24 Assessment, p. 24.)

25 h. In the case of Swainson's Hawk, pre-construction surveys for nesting

26 Swainson's hawks within 0.5 miles of the work areas will be conducted for

20 53. By seeking to mitigate such a wide array of potentially significant environmental
21 impacts via reliance on avoidance measures that are nothing short of mitigation, the District
22 attempts an unlawful sleight of hand. The existence of mitigation measures, no matter the name,

23 is itself evidence of potentially significant impacts that may not be swept away under the guise of

24 a CEQA exemption. Because the District failed to prepare an initial study (Cal. Code of

25 Regulations, tit. 14, ch. 3, §15063), it was similarly unable to determine the necessary level of

26 environmental review. As consequence, the District's CEQA process failed to appropriately

27 analyze the Project's environmental impacts and potential mitigation measures.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 1

2 (Violations of CEQA Against Respondents - Inadequate and Improperly Deferred
Mitigation) U S 54. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set
un forth above.

O 55. By failing to conduct proper CEQA review for the Project, the District has

7 impermissibly deferred the analysis and mitigation of Project impacts. The avoidance

8 (mitigation) measures included in the Biological Assessment are wholly inadequate because they

9 are vague, incomplete, untested, infeasible, and lack defined performance standards. Further, the

10 impacts of the avoidance (mitigation) measures themselves have not been analyzed.

11 56. The avoidance measures contained in the Biological Assessment also improperly

12 defer mitigation. CEQA requires lead agencies to identify and evaluate feasible mitigation

13 measures. When mitigation measures are required, an environmental impact document should

14 discuss each possible mitigation measure and "the basis for selecting a particular measure should

15 be identified." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) "Formulation of mitigation measures

16 should not be deferred." (Ibid.) Contrary to these requirements, the Biological Assessment

17 unlawfully defers the formulation and analysis of mitigation measures, including but not limited

18 to plans to mitigate the Project's impacts on special-status species.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 19

20 (Against Respondents - Writ of Mandate and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Project
5883 Approval and NOE as Contrary to C.C.P. S§ 1085 and 1094.5)

57. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set
forth above.

58. Respondents proceeded in excess of jurisdiction and abused their discretion in 25 purporting to approve the NOE because such approval violates Code of Civil Procedure sections
26 1085 and/or 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:

27 a. Such approval was not made in accordance with the procedures required by law;

28 b. Such approval was not based on, and were contrary to, the evidence in the record -21- STOEL RIVes LLP

F before Respondents.

2 59. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by violating CEQA

3 and its implementing regulations and by otherwise acting contrary to law in executing and relying
v upon the NOE.

5 60. Notwithstanding Respondents' unlawful approval of the NOE, Respondents have
6 failed to present any evidence that the District has successfully carried out the extensive
7 avoidance measures (mitigation) identified in the Biological Assessment as prerequisite

8 requirements to Project implementation

9 61. Respondents' actions in approving the NOE without complying with the

10 procedures required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5 exceed

11 Respondents' jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are

12 invalid and must be set aside.

14 (Against Respondents - Declaratory Relief)

15 62. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation set

16 forth above.

17 63. An actual controversy exists between the parties concerning their respective rights

18 and duties because Petitioner contends, and Respondents dispute, that in approving the Project,

19 Respondents were required to comply with the statutory requirements of CEQA and have failed

20 to do so.

21 64. Respondents improperly approved the Project and issued the NOB without

22 adequate environmental review.

Re: NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA ACTION

Dear Board of Trustees:

Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, please take notice that Stockton Delta Resort, LLC intends to file a petition for writ of mandate under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) against Reclamation District No. 548 and the Board of Trustees of Reclamation District No. 548 (collectively the
"District").

The action will challenge the District's certification and reliance upon an improperly approved Notice of Exemption as the basis for the District's approval of rehabilitation of the Levee Repair
Project on Terminous Tract between levee station 531+00 to 583+00 (the "Project"). The petition will seek to vacate the District's actions and approvals related to the Project as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. This action will be filed with the San Joaquin County Superior
Court.

Very truly yours,

("District"), and Stockton Delta Resort, LLC, a California limited corporation ("SDR"), both of which are individually referred to below as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

RECITALS

A. District is proposing work on the Terminous Tract Levee between levee stations 531+00 and 583+00 (the "Project"). The Project's impacts will include, but are not limited to, impacts to existing commercial parking and access for the Tower Park Resort and
Marina.

B. On July 26, 2019, the District filed a Notice of Exemption (*NOE") under the California Environment Quality Act ("CEQA") for the Project with the San Joaquin County Clerk. The NOE states that the Project is categorically exempt under Sections 15301 and 15302 of the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq., hereinafter, "Guidelines").

C. The statute of limitations for a legal challenge to an NOE is 35 days from the date that the NOE is filed. (Guidelines, § 15062(d).) The Parties disagree as to whether the Project is exempt from CEQA under Guidelines sections 15301 and 15302 or any other exemption ("Dispute").

D. The Parties desire to avoid the filing of any legal action relating to the Dispute at this time and wish to engage in further discussion aimed at resolving the Dispute.
