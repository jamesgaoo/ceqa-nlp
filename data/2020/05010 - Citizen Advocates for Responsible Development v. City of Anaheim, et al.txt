3 Petitioner/plaintiff, Citizen Advocates for Responsible Development, a non-profit

4 mutual benefit corporation of interested property owners directly impacted by the

5 proposed development ("Petitioner"), hereby petitions this Court for a peremptory writ of

6 mandate/mandamus, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, to

7 be directed to respondents/defendants, the City of Anaheim ("City") and its City Council

8 (collectively, "Respondents"), along with other causes of action alleged herein, including

as

9 to the applicant and real party in interest 6509 Serrano L.P. ("Applicant"). This

10 petition/complaint alleges conduct in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
(Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000-21189.57) ("CEQA").

11 1. THE PARTIES

12

NEWMEYER DILLION EN 13 Petitioner is a non-profit mutual benefit corporation of interested and

14 neighboring property owners that are directly impacted by the proposed development

15 commonly referred to as the "Residences at Nohl Ranch Project," a proposed residential

16 development project located at 6501-6513 Serrano Avenue (APN 365-062-09), in

17 Anaheim, California (the "Project"). Petitioner's mission includes advocacy in support of

18 responsible development within the City that follows a careful, open, public, and robust

19 environmental analysis prior to development-and not after the fact-as the law
requires.

2.

20

21 Petitioner's mission also includes the maintenance of a quality environment

22 for the people of this State, now and in the future, which is a matter of statewide

23 concern. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).) As an organization, Petitioner is

24 authorized to challenge and, consequently, to enforce state law where there is a need to

25 maintain the people's natural resources in this State. (See id., at subd. (c).) Relatedly,

26 Petitioner's mission understands that the capacity of the environment is limited and that

27 every citizen has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of

28 the environment. (See id., at subds. (d), (e).) Accordingly, Petitioner's interests are
germane to the intent of the Legislature to take immediate, systematic, and concerted

4586.101 / 8665548.1 efforts to enhance environmental control and to control environmental pollution. (See
- 2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 id., at subds. (d), (f).)

2 3.

3 As a result, Petitioner must act to provide for clean air, clean water, and

4 unencumbered enjoyment of the intrinsic and independently valuable aesthetic, natural,

5 scenic, and historic environment that exists in this State. (Pub. Resources Code, §

6 21001, subd. (b).) Likewise, Petitioner is compelled to ensure that public agencies shall

7 not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation

8 measures available that would lessen the environmental effects and/or prevent the

9 elimination of these most valuable natural resources.

4.

10 Respondent/defendant City is a public entity located in the State of

11 California. The City is required to comply with state, local, and federal law, rules, and

12 regulations, including, without limitation, CEQA.

5.

NEWMEYER 13

DILLION Respondent/defendant City Council of the City of Anaheim ("City Council")

14 is the elected governing body of the City and has final decision-making authority,

15 including the resolution of appeals. Like the City, the City Council is required to comply

16 with local, state, and federal law, including CEQA.

6.

17 Petitioner is informed and believes that Applicant is a California limited

18 partnership that is the applicant for the Project and is doing business in Orange County,

California.

19 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the
20 respondents/defendants sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore

21

22 sues them by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition/complaint to

23 allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.
8.

24 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant

25 times mentioned herein, Respondents and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, were the

26 agents, servants, and employees of each other and in doing the things herein alleged,

27 were acting within the course and scope of their authority as such agents, servants, and

28 employees with the permission, consent, and knowledge of each other.

2 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
9.

3 CEQA requires that public agencies review potential environmental

4 impacts of a proposal and consider ways to minimize or avoid environmental damage.

5 Under CEQA, a "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for

6 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

7 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §
15378, subd. (a).)

8 10.

9 "Approval" of a project under CEQA, means a decision by the public

10 agency "which commits the agency to a definitive course of action in regard to a project

11 intended to be carried out by any person." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15352, subd. (a).)
11.

12 The Project is proposed at 6501-6513 Serrano Avenue (APN 365-062-09),

NEWMEYER <e NOI7710 13 in Anaheim, California, and would be located on approximately three acres at the

14 northeast corner of Serrano Avenue and Nohl Ranch Road, in the southeastern portion
of the City of Anaheim ("Property").

15 12.

16 Upon information and belief, in or about late 2018, the City prepared an

17 initial study, and, shortly thereafter, a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR"),
which it completed in or about July 2019.

18 13. The Draft EIR included the following project description:

19

20 3.3.1 Description of the Project

21 The Project Applicant proposes to demolish the existing Serrano
Center, which consists of seven one-story buildings, totaling

22 approximately 42,526 square feet of nonresidential space, to

23 construct 58 multifamily units on 3.03 acres, with a development
density of 19.14 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The units would be

24 constructed in eight buildings totaling 118,351 square feet, consisting of 35 two-bedroom units and 23 three-bedroom units in

25 three-story townhomes, two-story townhomes, carriage

26 townhomes, and stacked flats. The units would range in size from 1,171 to 2,018 square feet. Project amenities include two outdoor

27 lounges, an outdoor dining room, an outdoor living room, and three
artificial turfplay areas.

28 Of the 58 units proposed for the Proposed Project, 12 affordable housing units would be provided in

4586.101 / 8665548.1

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

2 order to be eligible for an Affordable Housing Density Bonus and associated incentives.

3 Building and Building 2 that front Serrano Avenue would be

4 three stories, with a maximum building height of 40 feet at the top of the roof, and the overall height of the building wall would be 31

5 feet and 6 inches. Buildings 3 and 3 4, 5, and 8 on the northern

6 half of the Project Site would be two stories a with a maximum height at 30 feet at the top of the roof. Buildings 6 and 7 would have similar

7 elevations as Building 5; therefore, no separate elevation views have been provided.

8

9 units that front Serrano Avenue would be three stories high, and units on the northern half of the Project Site would be two stories high.
10 Access and Parking
11

12 The existing site is accessed via two driveways on Serrano Avenue and one on Nohl Ranch Road. The westerly driveway on Serrano
NEWMEYER & NOITTIO 13 Avenue would be eliminated, and vehicular access to the Project Site would be provided from two driveways: one driveway on

14 Serrano • Avenue and one on Nohl Ranch Road. The Serrano

15 Avenue entry would be near the southeast corner of the Project Site, roughly in the same location as the existing driveway, providing full

16 vehicular access. The access on Nohl Ranch Road would be
approximately 125 feet from the intersection of Nohl Ranch

17 Road/Serrano Avenue and provide right-in and right-out vehicular

18 access. A main internal access drive would connect the Nohl Ranch
Road and Serrano Avenue driveways, providing access to the units'

19 garages.

20 The Proposed Project would provide a total a of 148 parking spaces,

21 which would include 116 garage spaces and 32 uncovered surface
parking spaces, including two ADA spaces. Each dwelling unit

22 would contain two garage spaces. Seven of these units would have
tandem parking (14 garage spaces).

23 Proposed City Approvals

24 Approval of the Proposed Project includes certification of

25 Environmental Impact Report No. 351, including the adoption of

26 Findings of Fact and Mitigation Monitoring Program No. 359;
approval of a General Plan Amendment; a Zoning Reclassification;

27 an Affordable Housing Density Bonus and associated Tier Il
Incentives; a Vesting Tentative Tract Map; a Conditional Use

28 Permit; and a Specimen Tree Removal Permit. Together, the

4 14.

5 The City closed public review of the Draft EIR in or about September 3,

6 2019. In October 2019, it released the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIR"),

7 The Final EIR revealed that, despite receiving over a hundred comments to the Draft

8 EIR, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, and making various revisions to
address a small number of the comments and/or errors and omissions discovered

9 subsequent to the release of the Draft EIR for public review, the City declined to

10 recirculate the Draft EIR for further comment and evaluation despite the existence of

11 significant deficiencies.

12 15. On October 28, 2019, the Anaheim Planning Commission ("Planning

LEWMEYER DILLION P 13 Commission") unanimously denied the Applicant's request for approval of an

14 amendment to the City's General Plan and other Project entitlements

15 ("Entitlements"), which was one of the approvals required for the Project. The

16 proposed General Plan Amendment would amend the land use designation from

17

18 Neighborhood Center to Low-Medium Density Residential. The denial of the proposed

19 General Plan Amendment meant the denial of the Project as proposed at the Planning
Commission level. The Applicant appealed the Planning Commission's decision to the

20 City Council.

21 16. On January 14, 2020, the City Council opened the public hearing on the

22

23 Applicant's appeal and received testimony and/or written objections/comments from over
30 persons. After closing the public hearing, the City Council continued the item to

24 January 28, 2020. On January 28, 2020, the City Council approved a revised version of

25 the Project. These revisions, the potential impacts of which were never studied under

26 CEQA, included a reduction in the maximum number of dwelling units from 58 to 54 with

27 20% reserved for moderate-income affordable units.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

17. One or more of Petitioner's members, among others, objected orally and/or
2 in writing at the City Council's public hearing(s) regarding its approval of the Project,
3 including its approval (certification) of the Final EIR and the related Entitlements

4 (General Plan Amendment, Conditional Use Permit, Vesting Tentative Tract Map, Tree
5 Removal Permit, etc.), thus satisfying the requirements with respect to administrative

6 exhaustion.

7 18. The Final EIR (as derived from the Draft EIR) fails to sufficiently evaluate,

8 determine, and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, as outlined below and in

9 the comments incorporated by reference herein. Additionally, the Final EIR, for the first
10 time, incorporates substantial and significant new information and analyses that must be
11 allowed to undergo further public review.

12 19. Petitioner's members and members of the public identified and made
83A3WM3N DILLION D 13 comments regarding several deficiencies in the City's environmental analysis of the

14 Project. These comments included, without limitation:

15 insufficient analysis of potential temporary and non-temporary aesthetic

16 impacts caused by the construction of the Project, including, without

17 limitation, impacts on views, air, and light to neighboring properties;

18 failure to sufficiently analyze potential impacts of tree removals and
19 required planting of three new trees for every tree removed and failure to

20 evaluate alternatives;

21 failure to sufficiently analyze aesthetic and other impacts of proposed

22 building heights (up to three stories high) or evaluate lower-building height

23 alternatives;

24 inadequate analysis of potential presence of material containing asbestos
25 and lead-based paint and resulting impacts of demolition and Project

26 construction if such materials are present;

27 inadequate analysis of noise and vibration impacts (both during and after

28 construction) and failure to identify or implement sufficient mitigation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

1 measures related to such impacts;
2 failure to analyze potential noise impacts to sensitive receptors from areas
3 of the Project site closest to such receptors;

4 failure to Identify all potentially significant traffic impacts, insufficient
5 analysis of potential traffic impacts that were identified, and failure to
6 implement adequate mitigation measures for such impacts;
7 failure to sufficiently analyze or develop mitigation measures for potentially
8 significant parking impacts,
9 failure to analyze various potential safety impacts from the project,
10 including sight-distance issues, blind corners, and parking congestion in
11 high-risk areas (evidence of traffic accidents was submitted by several

12 speakers);

NEWMEYER NOITTIO 13 failure to sufficiently analyze or establish mitigation measures for potential

14 impacts on emergency access and evacuation conditions, especially due to
15 the fact that the Project and adjacent properties are located in a high fire
16 zone; and

17 failure to sufficiently analyze potential cumulative impacts from other

18 existing and/or reasonably foreseeable development projects within the

19 area.

20 20. On January 29, 2020, the City filed a Notice of Determination for the

21 Project and Petitioner timely gave notice and filed suit within thirty days of the same. A

22 true and correct copy of the City's Notice of Determination is attached hereto as Exhibit
23 A and incorporated by reference herein.

24 21. Notably, although it is not mentioned in the Notice of Determination, it is

25 Petitioner's understanding that the City Council did not approve one of the required

26 approvals for the Project-the approval of an amendment to the City's zoning map.

27 Petitioner reserves the right to assert further objections and update this petition to the
28 extent there are further potential impacts resulting from this pending Project approval.

1 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
2 22. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under Code of Civil

3 Procedure sections 394, 1085, 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168 et

4 seq. Many of Petitioner's members, including Rick Farano, live in the City and will be
5 directly affected by the Project's numerous impacts, including environmental impacts.

8 23. Petitioner's members, among others, submitted extensive oral and written
7 comments at all stages of the public process. By virtue of said comments, which are

8 incorporated by reference herein, Petitioner has exhausted all required administrative

9 remedies.

10 24. Prior to filing this action, Petitioner provided all required notices to the City;
11 a true and correct copy is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

12 25. As such, Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this
H3A3WM3N DILLION € 13 action and has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

14 21167.5.

15 26. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the offenses alleged in this

16 petition and thus petitions this Court for relief as prayed for herein.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Peremptory Writ of Mandate/Mandamus-Against Respondents and DOES 1-50)

19 27. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1

20 through 25, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

21 28. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to Public Resources Code

22 sections 21168 and 21168.5, the California Constitution, and the City's land use

23 regulations and local ordinances.

24 29. Residences at Nohl Ranch is considered a "project" as defined by the

25 California Public Resources Code, as it is an activity that may cause either a direct

26 physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
27 change in the environment.

28 /1/
4586.101 / 8665548.1 - 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE/MANDAMUS

30. Respondents' consideration and approval of the Project constitutes
2 a "approval of a project" within the meaning of CEQA.

3 31. Approval of the Final EIR for the Project was discretionary, not ministerial.

4 As such, the City was required to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project.
5 32. By approving and certifying the Final EIR without updating or revising
6 related environmental analyses and mitigation measures, without completing a new a
7 initial study for the effects of the changes to the Project, without meaningfully responding
8 to the public comments incorporated by reference herein, and without recirculating the
9 EIR for public comment, Respondents violated CEQA, among other local, state, and
10 federal laws, rules, and regulations.

11 33. For example, CEQA mandates recirculation of an EIR where significant

12 new information is added after public notice is given, but before certification. (See Pub.
d3A3WM3N • 13 Resources Code, § 21092.1; see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088.5.) Here,
DILLION 14 Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR in violation of CEQA. (See Cal. Code Regs.,

15 tit. 14, § 15088.5.) As a result, the EIR does not adequately evaluate environmental

16 impacts that the Project will have on the surrounding community, including, without

17 limitation, traffic, parking, noise, vibrations, hazardous substances, aesthetics, and other

18 such issues addressed in the public comments incorporated by reference herein.

19 34. Furthermore, Respondents certified the Final EIR and approved the other

20 Project entitlement-requests despite glaring inconsistencies with the City's General Plan

21 and zoning regulations, in violation of CEQA, the California Government Code, and the

22 Anaheim City Charter, which incorporates the same either expressly or as a matter of

23 statewide concern.

24 35. Petitioner, therefore, requests that this Court issue a peremptory writ of
25 mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to vacate and/or set aside the approvals

26 discussed herein, including the approval and certification of the Final EIR.

27 36. The public interest will suffer from Respondents' failure to comply with

28 CEQA, the City's land use regulations, and the City's contracting away of its legislative*
4586.101 / 8665548.1 • 10 -

2 powers. Petitioner, therefore, requests the recovery of its attorneys' fees pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 37. (Declaratory Relief-Against Respondents and DOES 50-100)

6 Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1

7 through 35, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

38.

8 Actual and substantial controversies have arisen between Petitioner and
Respondents.

9 39.

10 Petitioner contends that Respondents have violated CEQA and the City's
land use requirements.

11 40.

12 powers, Petitioner contends that the City has improperly contracted away its police

NEWMEYER DILLION 4B 13 whereas Respondents contend that they have not done so.

41.

14 Petitioner further contends that the Project may not proceed in light of

15 these violations and potential environmental impacts, whereas Respondents contend

otherwise.

16 42.

17 Based on the foregoing, without adequate remedy at law, Petitioner seeks

18 declaratory relief as further requested in the prayer herein.

19 43. REQUEST FOR HEARING AND BRIEFING SCHEDULE

20 Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.4, Petitioner requests

21 a that this Court notice a case management conference and establish a briefing schedule

22 for submission of points and authorities, and that a hearing on the petition be held within

23 30 days of filing of all briefing.

24 WHEREFORE, PETITIONER prays for entry of judgment as follows:

1.

25 For a peremptory writ of mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to

26 vacate and/or set aside the Final EIR certification and related approvals discussed

herein;

Petitioner's action will challenge the project commoniy referred to as the "Residences at Nohl Ranch Project," a proposed residential development project located at 6501-6513 Serrano Avenue (APN 365-062-09), Anaheim, California ("Project"). Petitioner seeks to

9999.SLT / 8662353.1

Anaheim City Council February 27, 2020
Page 3

challenge the Project and all its approvals as a violation of CEQA and seek a peremptory writ of mandate/mandamus to vacate and to set aside the decision of the Anaheim City Council as outlined in the Notice of Determination attached hereto and quoted above, seeking relief as follows:

• To vacate and set aside certification of the inadequate Final Environmental Impact Report, (SCH No. 2018121031) (hereafter, "EIR");
To vacate and set aside the Notice of Determination for the Project;
To undergo a second environmental review for the Project in entirety;
To recirculate the EIR;
To prepare a legally adequate environmental impact report; and,
To otherwise comply with CEQA and all other applicable state, federal, and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and policies in reviewing the Project.
The above relief is premised on the grounds that the EIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis because of its inaccurate description of the Project and the baseline environmental setting. As a result, the analysis of the Project's impacts related to
aesthetics; air quality; biological resources; cultural resources; energy; geology, soils, and paleontological resources; greenhouse gas emissions; hazards and hazardous materials; hydrology and water quality; land use and planning; noise; public services; transportation; tribal cultural resources; utilities and services systems; and wildfire risks were not properly addressed, analyzed, or mitigated. The Project also mischaracterizes certain impacts as significant and unavoidable when they are not and fails to describe
the full spectrum of alternatives to the Project, including the resulting mitigation
measures.

Aside from failing to properly analyze the Project's impacts or provide proper mitigation measures, the EIR failed to properly respond to significant concerns raised throughout the comment period. Adding insult to injury, the final EIR added new appendices-
resulting in entirely new, significant information withheld from the public review--without
engaging in the proper recirculation as required under CEQA.
In addition to a peremptory writ of mandate directing the Anaheim City Council to take action as outlined above, Petitioner will also seek
An order staying the effects of the certification of the EIR and all other
possible approvals;

9999.SLT/ 8662353.1
