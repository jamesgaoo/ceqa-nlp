VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner CITY OF ROCKLIN (*Petitioner"), for their causes of action, allege:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Petitioner CITY OF ROCKLIN respectfully petitions this Court for a writ of

4 mandate ordering the TOWN OF LOOMIS and the TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF

5 LOOMIS to rescind its August 11, 2020, decision to certify an environmental impact report

6 ("EIR") and approve a zoning code amendment, Use Permit, Design Review Permit and Lot

7 Line Adjustment for the construction and operation of a 155,000 square foot Costco Warehouse

8 retail store and up to 30 position fueling station facility with a single-primary access driveway
on Sierra College Boulevard and adding a fourth traffic signal on the half-a-mile long corridor

10 between I-80 and Taylor Road in the TOWN OF LOOMIS ("Project"). As set forth below, the

11 TOWN's approval of the Project violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

12 Public Resources Code §§21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, the California Planning and

13 Zoning Law, and the LOOMIS General Plan and Zoning Code. Petitioner seeks writ of

14 mandate directing the Respondents to set aside the approval of the Project pursuant to Code of

15 Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5.

16 PARTIES

17 2. Petitioner CITY OF ROCKLIN ("ROCKLIN") is a general law city incorporated
18 under the laws of the State of California and located in Placer County. ROCKLIN a has a direct

19 and substantial beneficial interest in: (i) ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA as a

20 result of ROCKLIN's status as a responsible agency (Title 14, Cal. Code of Regs. §15231), and

21 (ii) ensuring the shared infrastructure between Respondents and ROCKLIN continues to operate

22 safely and effectively, and, thus, bring this Petition on behalf of the residents of the ROCKLIN

23 who are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners.

24 3. TOWN OF LOOMIS ("LOOMIS") a general law city incorporated under the

25 laws of the State of California and located in Placer County, is responsible for regulating and

26 controlling land use in LOOMIS and for implementing and complying with the local and state

27 laws implicated by this Verified Petition For Writ of Mandate, including CEQA and state and

28 local land use laws. LOOMIS is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the Project, LOOMIS is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes

2 the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary, evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives

3 to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.

4 4. TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF LOOMIS ("LOOMIS COUNCIL") is

5 the duly elected legislative body authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the

6 State of California to act on behalf of LOOMIS. Respondent LOOMIS COUNCIL is

7 responsible for implementing and complying with the local and state laws implicated by this

8 Verified Petition For Writ of Mandate, including the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA
Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"),

10 and the California Planning and Zoning Laws.

11 5. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

12 co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those respondents sued herein under the fictitious names

13 of DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner, who therefore sue those

14 respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioners will ask leave of court to amend this Petition

15 and insert the true names and capacities of these respondents when the same have been

16 ascertained. Petitioners are informed and believe and, on that basis, allege that each of the

17 respondents designated herein as a DOE respondent is legally responsible in some manner for

18 the events, acts and omissions, and the impact on Petitioners' rights alleged in this Petition.

19 6. At all relevant times to this action, each named DOE respondent through 20

20 was and is the alter-ego, agent, servant, employee, co-conspirator or aider and abettor of each of

21 the remaining named and DOE respondents, and acting within the purpose and scope of that

22 relationship with the express or implied knowledge, permission and consent of the remaining

23 named and DOE respondents, and each of them, and each of said respondents ratified and

24 approved the acts of the other respondents.

25 7. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

26 COSTCO WAREHOUSE CORPORATION ("COSTCO") is a corporation duly organized and

27 existing by virtue of the laws of the State of Washington who was doing business in the State of

28

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 California at the time of the events stated herein. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon

2 alleges that COSTCO is the current property owner and applicant for the Project.

3 8. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate,

4 co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those real parties sued herein under the fictitious names of

5 DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner, who therefore sue those real parties

6 by such fictitious names. Petitioners will ask leave of court to amend this Petition and insert the

7 true names and capacities of these real parties when the same have been ascertained. Petitioners

8 are informed and believe and, on that basis, allege that each of the real parties designated herein
as a DOE real party is legally responsible in some manner for the events, acts and omissions,

10 and the impact on Petitioners' rights alleged in this Petition.

11 9. At all relevant times to this action, each named DOE real party 21 through 40

12 was and is the alter-ego, agent, servant, employee, co-conspirator or aider and abettor of each of

13 the remaining named and DOE real parties, and acting within the purpose and scope of that

14 relationship with the express or implied knowledge, permission and consent of the remaining

15 named and DOE real parties, and each of them, and each of said real parties ratified and

16 approved the acts of the other real parties,

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 10. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1085 and

19 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the Court has jurisdiction to issue

20 a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project.

21 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

22 arose in Placer County, where the proposed Project will be constructed and operate.

23 12. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

24 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on

25 Respondents on September 1, 2020. Copies of the written notice and proof of service are

26 attached hereto as Exhibit A.

27

28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

2 21167.6 by filing, concurrently with this Petition, a notice of their election to prepare the record

3 of administrative proceedings relating to this action.

4 14. Petitioner is complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

5 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General within 10 days

6 after the filing of this Petition.

7 15. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant

8 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

9 by law.

10 16. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

11 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

12 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies,

13 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of state and local laws, and Petitioner

14 would be obligated to presume the adequacy of the EIR when considering any subsequent

15 related approvals in its role as a responsible agency.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 The Project

18 17. COSTCO sought LOOMIS' approval of a zoning code amendment, Use Permit,

19 Design Review Permit and Lot Line Adjustment for the construction and operation of a 155,000

20 square foot Costco Warehouse retail store, as well as a fueling station with up to 30 fueling

21 positions ("Project"). The services to be provided would include mostly warehouse retail space,

22 while also including optical exams and sales, a photo processing center, hearing aid testing and

23 sales, food service preparation and sales, alcohol sales and tasting and a tire service center. a

24 18. The Project site is an approximately 17.4-acre site located on at the northwest

25 corner of Sierra College Boulevard and Brace Road. The Project site abuts the
26 ROCKLIN/LOOMIS border to the south and is across the street from the ROCKLIN/LOOMIS

27 border to the west.

28
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

19. The Project site has a land use designation of General Commercial, Residential

2 High Density and Residential Medium High Density in the LOOMIS General Plan and is zoned

3 General Commercial ("CG"), High Density Residential ("RH") and Medium Density Residential

4 ("RM-5").

5 20. The Project site is directly adjacent to the Sierra Meadows apartment complex on

6 the north end of the site and several single-family homes along the eastern boundary of the

7 Project site.

8 21. There is one main driveway access to the Project site located approximately 750

9 feet south of Brace Road. There are two secondary access routes into the site via Brace Road.

10 The first secondary access is a right-in-right-out only access that is to be primarily used for

11 delivery trucks, though also publicly accessible, located approximately 215 feet east of Sierra

12 College Boulevard. The second secondary access is a gate-controlled access to be used only for

13 emergency purposes, located to the east of the Sierra Meadows apartment complex at the north

14 end of the Project site. A third potential secondary access point is located to the south near the

15 southeast corner of the Project site. Development of this access point requires land use

16 permitting approval by ROCKLIN due to the need to cross private property before connecting to

17 Granite Drive.

18 Environmental Review Process

19 22. LOOMIS filed A Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report

20 for the Project with the State Clearinghouse on or about May 15, 2017.

21 23. LOOMIS circulated a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the

22 Project in June 2018.

23 24. Petitioner submitted written comments on the DEIR, noting that that the DEIR

24 failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts, including, but not limited to

25 transportation impacts and alternatives analysis, among other issues. Several other individuals

26 and government agencies also commented on the inadequate environmental review of the DEIR,

27 25. LOOMIS circulated a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report ("RDEIR")

28 for the Project in December 2019.
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. Petitioner submitted written comments on the RDEIR, noting that that the RDEIR

2 failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts, including, but not limited to

3 transportation, air quality, greenhouse gases and noise impacts, the VMT analysis and

4 alternatives analysis, among other issues.

5 27. LOOMIS then released a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for the

6 Project in June 2020.

7 Project Approval

8 28. On July 7, 2020, the LOOMIS Planning Commission ("Planning Commission")

9 held a public hearing on the EIR and the Project. Petitioner submitted a written comment letter

10 and representatives of Petitioner attended the public hearing via LOOMIS' YouTube webcast of

11 the hearing, objecting to the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. Among other

12 objections, the letter argued that the EIR failed to disclose certain data Respondents used to

13 support its assumptions in the traffic impact analysis and VMT analyses for the Project, that the

14 EIR failed to disclose all of the potentially significant traffic-related impacts, the inadequacy of

15 the alternatives analysis, inadequate responses to comments, Project inconsistencies with

16 fundamental Loomis General Plan policies, and inconsistencies with the LOOMIS zoning code.

17 After Petitioner and other members of the public made comments, the Planning Commission

18 closed the public hearing and voted to recommend that the LOOMIS COUNCIL certify the EIR

19 and approve the Project.

20 29. On or about August 4, 2020, Petitioner submitted a written comment letter to the

21 LOOMIS COUNCIL, again pointing out that the EIR was inadequate and could not support the

22 approval of the Project. Among other objections, the letter argued that the EIR failed to disclose

23 certain data Respondents used to support its assumptions in the traffic impact analysis and VMT

24 analyses for the Project, that the EIR failed to disclose all of the potentially significant traffic-

25 related impacts, the inadequacy of the alternatives analysis, Project inconsistencies with

26 fundamental Loomis General Plan policies, and inconsistencies with the LOOMIS zoning code.

27 30. On August 4, 2020, the LOOMIS COUNCIL held a public hearing on the EIR

28 and the Project and introduced Ordinance No. 285 that amended certain provisions of the
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 LOOMIS zoning code as part of the Project. A representative of Petitioner attended the hearing

2 and voiced objections to certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. The LOOMIS

3 COUNCIL closed the public hearing and continued the item to August 11, 2020.

4 31. On August 11, 2020, the LOOMIS COUNCIL held a second public hearing on

5 the Project, including the second reading and adoption of Ordinance No. 285, and certified the

6 EIR and approved the Project. The certification of the EIR, adoption of the ordinance, approval
7 of a lot line adjustment, and approval of a use permit and design review constitutes

8 Respondents' approval of the Project.

9 32. LOOMIS filed its Notice of Determination for the Project on or about August 12,

10 2020.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 For Writ of Mandamus [CCP § 1094.5, or alternatively § 1085] For Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act,

13 Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq. (Against All Respondents)

14 33. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,

15 inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint, as if fully set forth below.

16 34. CEQA requires the lead agency a for a project with the potential to cause

17 significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the

18 statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially

19 significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such

20 that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on

21 the proposed project. Additionally, the EIR must analyze mitigation measures and an adequate

22 range of alternatives to the project.

23 35. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible mitigation measures that

24 would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the

25 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars

26 the lead agency from approving project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the

27 project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would

2 have significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's

3 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

4 37. CEQA requires that an agency's findings for the approval of a project be

5 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and requires that an agency
6 provide an explanation of how the record evidence supports the conclusions the agency has

7 reached.

8 38. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is

9 inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines. Among

10 other defects, the EIR:

11 a. Failed to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

12 impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's impacts on

13 transportation, vehicle miles traveled, air quality, greenhouse gases, noise, aesthetics, land

14 use/planning and climate change;

15 b. Failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's

16 significant cumulative impacts;

17 C. Failure to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project;

18 d. Failed to identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the

19 impacts of the Project, including, but not limited to the adoption of mitigation for traffic impacts

20 on the Sierra College Boulevard corridor;

21 e, Improperly deferred mitigation and analysis of Project impacts, including,

22 but not limited to the mitigation of noise impacts.

23 39. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EIR after adding

24 substantial new information to the Final EIR, including, but not limited to a new vehicle miles

25 traveled ("VMT") study for the Project in the Final EIR, thus depriving the public of a

26 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on this new information.

27

28
-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

40. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

2 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not

3 limited to the following findings:

4 a. The determination that alternatives to the Project that would allegedly

5 meet the Project objectives and avoid or lessen the significant impacts of the Project are

6 infeasible or nonexistent. Instead of substantial evidence, Respondents' findings are based on

7 unsupported, and demonstrably self-serving and inaccurate assertions by COSTCO, the Project's

8 applicant;

9 b. The Respondents' determination that various mitigation measures,

10 including, but not limited to additional roadway improvements on Sierra College Boulevard, that

11 would lessen the significant impacts of the Project allegedly are infeasible or non-existent;

12 C. The Respondents' determination that certain impacts would be less than

13 significant and/or that adopted mitigation measures allegedly would reduce the Project's impacts

14 on the environment to a less than significant level.

15 41. Respondents further violated CEQA by adopting findings that do not provide the

16 reasoning, or analytic route, from facts to conclusions as required by law.

17 42. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

18 discretion by certifying an EIR, making findings, and taking related actions that do not comply

19 with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of

20 the Project must be set aside.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(PLANNING AND ZONING LAW.
22 LOOMIS GENERAL PLAN & ZONING CODE)

23 43. Petitioners reallege and fully incorporate by reference paragraphs through 42,

24 above.

25 44. Respondents' approval of the Project violates the LOOMIS General Plan,

26 because the Project is inconsistent with fundamental goals and policies that must be complied

27 with, including, but not limited to the Level of Service Policy, Natural Resources and Open

28 Space Policies 1.e and 1.j, and Land Use Policy F.5.
-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 45. Respondents' approval of the Project violates the LOOMIS Zoning Code,

2 because the proposed uses are not allowed in the applicable zoning district for the Project site,

3 including, but not limited to approving parking, drive aisles and access route uses for a

4 Warehouse Retail commercial use on residentially-zoned properties. In addition, approving

5 these uses was a de facto amendment to the LOOMIS zoning code without complying with the

6 legal requirements for zoning amendments pursuant to Government Code sections 65853

7 through 65857.

8 46. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

9 discretion by adopting Use Permit and Design Review permit findings that are unsupported by

10 substantial evidence and approving the Use Permit and Design Review permit for the Project

11 even though they are inconsistent with the LOOMIS General Plan and Zoning Code. As such,

12 Respondents' approval of the planning and zoning permits for the Project must be set aside.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

15 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

16 and set aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project;

17 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

18 comply with CEQA, the Guidelines, California Planning and Zoning Law, and other applicable

19 laws, and take any other action as required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

20 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

21 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees, and

22 all others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action, including

23 issuance of grading or building permits, to implement the Project, pending full compliance with

24 the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, California Planning and Zoning Law, and other

25 applicable laws;

26 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

27 permanent injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and their agents, servants, and

28 employees, and all others acting in concert with Real Parties in Interest on their behalf, from

5 6. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and

6 other provisions of law; and
