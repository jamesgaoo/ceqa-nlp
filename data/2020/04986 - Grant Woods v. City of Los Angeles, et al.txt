IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 Project Location

3 7. The Project is located at 4445-4465 Lankershim Boulevard; 10850-10862

4 Riverside Drive, and, 10847-10867 ndale Street, Toluca lake, CA 91602.

5 Project Description

6 8. The Project Site is located on the west side of Lankershim Boulevard, between

7 Riverside Drive to the north and Landale Street to the south, in the City of Los Angeles, 91602

8 and is zoned C2-1VL-RIO and P-1VL-RIO. The Site is located within the Sherman Oaks-Studio

9 City-Toluca Lake-Cahuenga Pass Community Plan, with a General Plan land use designation of

10 General Commercial and Low Medium Residential.

11 9. The Site is presently developed with an approximately 62,562-square foot, seven-

12 story commercial office building in the northeast portion of the Project Site, on the portion of the
13 lot zoned C2-1VL-RIO. The balance of the Site contains surface parking on the portion of the lot

14 zoned P-1VL-RIO. The existing office building was approved for the adaptive re-use under

15 Planning Case No. ZA-2006-9907-ZAD-PA1 and is currently in plan check for building permits

16 for the change of use from commercial office to 55 dwelling units and 8,500 square feet of

17 ground floor commercial floor area (the Adaptive Re-use Building). The Adaptive Re-use
18 Building will remain in place with the Project.

19 10. The proposed Project consists of the construction, operation, and maintenance of

20 a mixed-use building comprising 179 residential apartment units, including eight (8) affordable

21 units reserved for Very Low Income households, and approximately 5,684 square feet of

22 commercial floor area, with a maximum height of approximately 60 feet (exclusive of roof

23 projections), varying from two to five stories on a 67,315-square foot portion of the Site. Off.

4 Approval of the Project

5 11. On October 13, 2016, Real Parties in Interest submitted the Project. Notice was

6 given to residents within 500 feet.

7 12. In January 2019 a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") No.: ENV-2016-
3904-MND was prepared for The City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning. An

9 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") was not included with the MND or any other document
10 submitted for the Project. The lack of an EIR and the MND is the basis for this writ.
11 13. On June 24, 2019, the City Planning Commission submitted a Letter of
12 Determination approving the Project.

13 14. On July 15, 2019, I appealed the City Planning Commission's decision to

14 Approve the Project.
15 15. On September 10, 2019, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee

16 upheld the City Planning Commission's decision.

17 16. On September 30, 2019 the Council approved the Project.
18

19 V. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUATE

20 REMEDIES AT LAW

21 17. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference each allegation of paragraphs 1

22 through 16, inclusive, of his writ as though set forth here in full against each and every
23 Respondent.

24 18. I have fully exhausted administrative remedies.
25 19. I have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

26

27

PETITION FOR WRIT

T this Court grants the requested Writ of Mandate and Injunctive Relief. In the absence of such
remedies, the City's approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration will form the basis for a 2

3 project, which will proceed in violation of state law.

4 20, I have complied with Public Resources Code §21167.7 by filing a copy of this

5 petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit A.

6 21. have complied with Public Resources Code §21167.5 by providing the City with

7 notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit B.

22. request that the City prepare the record of administrative proceedings relating to

9 this action. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit C.
10 VI. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

12 23. I realleges and incorporates by reference each allegation of paragraphs 1

13 through 21, inclusive, of his writ as though set forth here in full against each and every

14 Respondent.

15 24. The City's approval of the Project resulted in violation of CEQA

16

17 The MND is inadequate as a matter of l The Fair Standard requires the preparation of
18 further environmental documents

19 25. The MND fails to identify potential significant impacts and inadequately

20 mitigates potential significant impacts identified. The perfunctory discussions of mitigation in

21 the MND are merely conclusory, not based on evidence and do not satisfy the requirements of

22 CEQA and should be studied in an EIR.

23 26. California Law supports the strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation

24 of an EIR based on the "Fair Argument" standard. Simply, whenever the record contains

25 substantial evidence that a project may have significant effect on the environment, there is a

26 presumption that an EIR should be required.

27 27. The "Fair Argument" standard a is a low threshold and reflects the strong public

28
5
PETITION FOR WRIT

P policy interest for resolving doubts in favor of a thorough environmental review. Where based

2 on observations, the opinions and testimony from local residents are relevant to impacts such as

3 aesthetics and traffic and sonstitute substantial evidence in support of a "Fair Argument" for an

4 EIR.

5 28. Here, a Fair Argument clearly existed that the Project will have potential

6 significant adverse impacts on adequately addressed in the MND.

7

8 Air Quality

9 29. No meaningful consideration seems to have been given to Emission Vehicle

10 Miles Traveled by the traffic generated by this project. Adding 179 residential units and

11 additional commercial space will have significant adverse impacts on circulation that, among

12 other things, should be considered more fully in an EIR. The project will result in up to 1,428

13 net vehicle trips. That will result in significant air pollution that will adversely and significantly

14 affect the environment.

15

16 Geology and Soils

17 30. The project is subject to liquefaction, so it is not appropriate to subject the

18 residents of an additional 179 units to such risk. The investigation conducted in this regard

19 occurred almost three years ago, before the most recent, near-historic rains in Los Angeles, and
20 are, therefore outdated and flawed. New testing should be done to determine the water level and

21 the risk of liquefaction, which was identified in Zimas. Further, the risk of increasing rainfall

22 water levels should be evaluated within the context of climate change. and the change in ground

23

24 Hazards and hazardous materials

25 31. The project will result in the loss of existing trees and will subject the public or

26 the environment through the potential release of hazardous materials during the development

27 process, which has not been adequately evaluated or mitigated.

28

6

PETITION FOR WRIT

1 Noise

2 32. Construction equipment, radios and walk-talkies used on the construction site,

3 equipment backup beepers, jackhammers, and other equipment, including trucks will create

4 significant noise for the more than two-year anticipated construction period that will not be

5 mitigated to a level of no significant impact upon the environment.

6

7 Population and housing

8 33. Site Plan Review is triggered by 50 units. This Project has more than 3 times that|
9 many units and will significantly and adversely affect the neighborhood. Approving it with a

10 MND is a violation of CEQA.

11

12 Traffic

13 34. No meaningful consideration seems to have been given to Emission Vehicle

14 Miles Traveled by the traffic generated by this project. Adding 179 residential units and

15 additional commercial space will have significant adverse impacts on traffic that, among other

16 things, should be considered more fully in an EIR. The project will result in up to 1,428 net
17 vehicle trips. That will result in significant traffic impacts that will adversely and significantly
18 affect the environment.

19

20 VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 In each of the above respects, Respondent has violated its duties under the law, acted

22 capriciously, abused its direction, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
23 WHEREFORE, I pray for the following relief:
24 1. For alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondent City of Los

25 Angeles to:

26 A. Set aside and vacate its adoption of the MND for the Project;

27

28
7

PETITION FOR WRIT

L B. Set aside an vacate any approvals for the Project based upon the MND and

2 abuse of discretion; and

3 C. Prepare and certify legally adequate EIR for the Project so that Respondent
v will have a complete disclosure document that will identify, for the decision-
makers and the public, the potentially significant impacts of the Project and

6 enable the formulation of realistic and feasible alternatives and mitigation

7 measures to avoid such impacts.

8 2. For an order enjoining Respondent City of Los Angeles and Real Party in Interest

o from taking any action to construct or operate the Project in any way that could result in a

10 significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful approval is obtained

11 from Respondent after the preparation and consideration of an adequate EIR;

12 3. For reasonable attorney fees;

13 4. For costs of suit;

14 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
